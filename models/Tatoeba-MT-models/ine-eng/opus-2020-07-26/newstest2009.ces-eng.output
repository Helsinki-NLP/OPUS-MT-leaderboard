The Prague Stock Exchange went down to the end of the trade
After the early collapse, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares have reached almost half of the ordinary daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange was immediately tied from the beginning of Tuesday's trade to its Monday fall when it dropped by almost six percent.
This time, there's a loss of action on Wall Street.
In this way, we see the market's reaction to the outcome of the vote by the US House of Representatives who refused to support the plan for the stabilisation of the dark financial sector.
Action area in Assisi
The dramatic fall on Tuesday saw stock in stock exchanges in Asia, even though the indexes lost some of them in the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index recorded almost four percent during the trade, but later part of the loss decreased and reduced to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which is monitoring the movement of Chinese stock exchanges in Hong Kong, dropped by 3.8%, and the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but eventually lost to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan, according to the dark index, decreased by 3.6 percent.
"The timing of a rescue action in the United States is inconceivable and affects the financial markets around the world," noted the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy on its own, thus independent of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong is at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudda, the US legislators should quickly return to the negotiations and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, he's threatening to feel another country.
Bloody pool of American shares
On Monday, the US Swedish representatives rejected the financial system support plan, to which up to $700 billion (approximately 12 billion CZK).
Lawmakers so ignored President George Bush's challenge to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
The American stock on Monday experienced a blood bath and the main stock indices recorded the largest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped by almost seven percent and a similar decline was reported last year in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal was not passed in the locker room, the index fell off in the open.
Congress stopped: The U.S. government can pump 700 billion dollars to the bank
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
We'll vote for him at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators have made a breakthrough in the negotiations on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system amounting to 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 billion crowns).
It's not won yet.
Congressmen must complete certain details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on the ground of the Secretariat of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Agent Reuters told the Banking and Financial Services Committee of Barney Frank.
According to the sources, the Senate may vote on the plan first on Wednesday.
Economies believe that the adoption of the rescue plan should be the first important psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
But then it comes to "cutting" because of the complexity of mechanisms that help markets to achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our different views on how to look like a package to stabilise the market," Democrat Nancy Pelosiová told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still come on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy from financial companies non-saleable mortgage assets that bring financial companies into serious losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are in the final agreement of the plan, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
We need to continue in the healing plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets that are rapidly declining.
According to Nevad democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement at Congress on Sunday.
They therefore want to calm investors before trading in the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where the Congress' decision could affect Monday's trading.
However, it is not yet clear with certainty when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the bill, or whether they can't tie the proceedings to a problem for the last time.
Lawmakers hope it'll be approved in the next few days.
But the law still knows a number of changes.
The total amount to be allocated to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
The original $350 billion should be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amounts if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, resulting in another $100 billion and later final $350 billion.
Bush assessed the progress in the negotiations
The President may vote in favour of this decision, but Congress may vote in favour of his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was to obtain funds for the redemption of bad mortgage securities, whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, has been maintained.
"We've done everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The US President Bush is pleased with the progress he has made in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciated the "bundling effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of gold falls
The chairman of the Banking Committee of Senator Dodd, the leader of the negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from loss, the closure of the benefits, the timing of the financing of the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit so-called gold strikes to directors of the participating companies and to establish a committee to oversee the fund.
He should be in charge of the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts with the help of homeowners who have problems with pay.
The government should negotiate new mortgage payments, which it buys, in order to reduce the monthly cost of payments for debtors and allow them to leave their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
According to the Chief Economist Patria Finance David Mark, the plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to realize.
"And that's because you don't know what the mechanism and what price the problem assets will buy.
This will determine how the financial sector and government will share losses between themselves," said Marek for the iHNed.cz server this week.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of next week, it's not as important as Mark's.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that it will be devoted as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on approval is now the most important thing," Marek stressed.
Fight against sharp knives: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We'll figure out how to choose
While almost every cell can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can dial.
That makes it clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons to order a single player.
The choice depends entirely on the way in which the future owner uses and demands.
You'll probably find it hard to set up a top expensive gramophone at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
However, such music products on the LP desk do not come from a qualitative point of view and there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you pressured yourself into wine with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream of such a gramophone at least.
It's the same with music on the roads, so music compressed, simple - music in MP3.
There are also price and qualitative categories.
For someone, it may be unacceptable to lose eight thousand crowns as well as Pink Floyd's fan will probably be difficult to test the audience for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremities between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Decides whether or not to hold the battery
Some top music players can do a lot more than just play music, but what most mobiles don't happen.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephoneing and examsing, he can play music and video, both record, he has better, worse camera and he can also navigate.
And if we take the smartphone and the comms, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can take pictures.
The universality of the cell also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator will send you on the display to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy spills.
A tiny cell phone can play music for more than ten hours, most of it's much less.
In this direction, the music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more efficient.
For cheap phones, count with the fact that you won't be playing for more than a few hours.
If you're still here and you're calling, go to work for security and get another charger - it's also for expensive devices.
In MP3 players you won't have this problem, and the worse it will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on one charge.
Another problem arises when recording music in the cell.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be connected directly to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few readers of the cards will deal with the miniature memory cards that are used in mobile phones without any reduction.
You do not need any special software for players except for iPods.
It's just a device to fill your music with USB from your computer.
Most mobiles and players are already creating a musical library named after the name of the interpreter, the name of the album, the genre or the need for user evaluation.
Some devices only display tree structure of directories like the Windows Explorer and some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with the operating system).
Players are serving, mobiles are more skilled
When selecting a specific device, take special care with regard to battery support, memory capacity, quality and sound output type and, of course, to the comfort of control.
If you have music above all and if you listen to it every day just briefly in the tramway, you will have enough of any cell phone that beats MP3.
Which he can actually do almost any cell phone.
You don't even have to watch too much the music formats of your cell phone or player.
MP3 will take over all and an absolute majority of the music that will reach you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widespread and besides it, the simple majority of the devices will also manage music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also allow for for example purchase of online music.
It is enough to visit the relevant operator's website (or other provider) and purchase a song or album.
This service could already be a fall-back argument for setting up a music cell.
Unfortunately, the operator's offer is poor and limits most of the time to a speedy hit radio.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) is the future of the music industry.
Most people still carry their cell phones.
Whenever you get a taste of listening to something, you put your cell phone in your pocket while the MP3 player is in the forgotten home.
However, it is still up to you whether you are also wearing a earring or at least a wire handlefree.
If not, you can use an integrated player who has almost every mobile but only a minimum MP3 player.
It'll probably be the biggest advantage of music cell phones for a lot of price.
The cheapest is usually under three thousand.
In three and four thousand crowns, you'll already have a very decent walkman.
Most of you, however, will limit the absence of a normal listener.
The best and the most equipped phones on the technical page, with a 3.5 mm headphone for the ordinary listener, are up to fifteen thousand.
The advantages of the players are, among other things, easy service.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice) - players can really control everyone.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of control with a previous routine tape recorder or maybe a gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of coliseum in the form of a faulty mobile internet and then a comprehensive data transfer account.
Where to reach
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) have normal slots on exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD etc.).
And by buying the card, you'll be in two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
In the basic models only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the dearest ones can deal with 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, download Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to lose more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding audiences, you would prefer to contact specialized mobiles - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsung).
These devices have a single control button for MP3 and the comfort of the service is so close to a single MP3 player.
Next is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles from the series walkman have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category to four thousand crowns, but with higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and supports the battery (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will take you MP3 players from the above mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will be in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively successful and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here -- a virtual operator that would make the classics survive.
Maybe it won't be long.
About the fact that the Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe, we have written on Mobil.cz many times.
He also confirmed the fact that the price of SMS is higher for us than for the rest of the Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission on roaming charges, a paradox might arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are kept so high compared to Europe?
The answer is a simple lack of competition that really wants to get into the fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, but we have three mobile networks and penetrations up to 100 percent.
On the contrary, mobile operators prefer to compete that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The Czech Telecommunications Office (CHTU) President Paul Dvořák, who said several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in Czech.
It is probably true that the classic operator with its own network has no more chances (lastly, it would already be hard to find frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual operator.
The direct entry of virtual operators into the mobile market brought a significant price reduction that the classic operators had to react to.
Then even before the entry, a song like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market sounded similar to ours in the United Kingdom.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and they can really be successful.
We still don't have to walk too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
Then behind Mobilking, there is a financial group of Penta, which in the Czech Republic owns, inter alia, U:fon.
The benefit of virtual operators is an opportunity to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they have a lot less customers than a classic operator.
They do not bear relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, such virtual operators are usually profiled as low-cost - offering cheap calls and SMS, which is often carried out by more expensive services.
Thus, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move and a commitment to an undecided target group.
This operator is specifically targeting men.
"Administrative guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and they can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a concept like that in Poland could catch us too.
He questioned the press spokesman Vodafon Miroslav Čepíký: "The Czech market is relatively small for segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the offer of services, it is relatively saturated."
In Czech without a chance, mobile operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there's a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it won't be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic do not seem too hopeful.
It is more likely that Mobilking will be released in other countries of our region," said Jana Studniková, a press spokesman for Penta's financial group in the phone conversation.
She has just confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, he is trying to do everything in his power to prevent any potential competitor from coming up.
The GTS Novera Group has been missing for a long time to launch a virtual mobile operator, which would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of the O2 Telephonics on the business lines.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only strong, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly dealt with these options with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already succeeded in moving forward in the negotiations," says the press spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe it's a good time, then.
The informal information suggests that we should wait for the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
For the time being, however, his creation is a continuous castle of silence.
"At this point, we do not think that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, no entity has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršeně of the O2 Telefónika Press Committee stated in his statement to Mobil.cz
Other operators shall also be referred to the specificity of the Czech market.
The T-Mobile speaker Martin Kemr added in a very rare way with the comment O2: "We have therefore not recorded any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which it would be possible to build further."
And he adds, "In the T-Mobile network, a virtual operator is hard to find by the end of the year.
At this point, we should already have a specific agreement on the table so that it can be considered in this short horizon."
Vodafone is more likely to pay its attention to meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepýk says: "We are open with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this right from the customers' point of view to be the most favourable.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible Authorities - With Operators One Hand
The process of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
Why, then, should the appearance of such a competitor be facilitated?
The fact that if there's anything to the operators, they're going to have to pull one wire, they're going to testify to the fact that the U:Fon.
About the biggest pressure towards CTU went in the time of the creation of U:fon from T-Mobile.
It shall bear witness to this publicly available information from the CTU website.
Now, however, U:fon fits as an argument why not to allow a virtual operator.
Martina Kemr's point of view: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would be subject to high requirements and, above all, to his services."
However, in view of this approach by mobile operators, the Czech regulatory authorities are totally insidious.
This is not only about the position of CTU, which unfortunately was in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - that has no power to engage in economic competition.
They are exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
But he took his typical position to the whole issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the agreement between a mobile operator and a virtual operator on the rental of the necessary infrastructure would have been concluded.
No such contract has been concluded until now, as the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," said Kristian Chalupa of the ÚOHS External Relations Committee in answer to our question.
It's probably not surprising from the representatives of the operators that the phrase is so formulated.
From the authority to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses his position on the market, it is more than a reasonable one.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual operators usually act, we can see that their market entry has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the price decrease is not in the interest of ÚOHS.
In fact, shocking in the whole case is the emotional conjugation of three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question is, if it's really just an accident, it's all on its own.
As well as the exact same price of petrol at pump stations, it is certainly only by accident and hard competition.
"The Authority in this matter has not looked for signs of anti-competitive behaviour, and therefore there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, so they do not have a corresponding increased responsibility for their conduct on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to meet the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by CTU, according to which telecommunications from a competitive point of view is the only market.
Then, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position in such a market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the consent of network operators.
And a mobile operator -- he's got a lot of logic -- on his own network of monopols.
So in a certain segment, it has to be dominant.
Even if we did not allow this argument, it should be minimal for the UOHS to warn that the three mobile operators are acting in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of a number of stakeholders (including GTS Novera) indicate that all operators are subject to very similar obstacles in the course of the proceedings.
Evaluation of responsibility for ČTÚ is then in telecommunications a relatively common trick that ÚOHS gives away from the whole matter of hand.
We've met with him in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, to the recent developments in the telecommunications law, the extension of CTU's powers to competition in telecommunications has not been able to take place, although a number of experts have since promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS must know more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
That's what happens when no one sees
However, there are still some pseudovirtual operators that exist in Czech mobile networks immediately.
They are companies that issue their own prices of mobile phone services, but are only partially public.
It's usually about companies that deal with multi-level marketing.
Personal mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others.
The pricers of these companies usually only get to the chosen ones.
Kuzlo is based on the fact that the company presents the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, he will then receive special prices (and other) offers.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar sales.
"If there were cases you are talking about, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would deal with and could end up working with the company," answered Martin Kemr's question.
It is quite unlikely, however, that similar activity would not be carried out to responsible people from mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, thousands of customers may be involved.
None of the operators will be able to prevent such a procedure.
These companies have unsatisfied profits from their activities and, unlike actual virtual operators, they are at no risk of their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepýk points out the potential problems: "The law of similar speculation allows, however, the services of these companies use only a negligible percentage of customers.
Moreover, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not on their behalf, so they cannot be fully available as normal mobile operators."
That's right, but it should be at least weird.
In addition, a further question will be opened for ÚOHS.
If mobile operators twist over a similar procedure, why block the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that ÚOHS has relatively strong powers to detect similar activities, and if he does not want to, he does not have to be satisfied with explaining to operators that they have no such idea and that their business conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the dearest
As in the text several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a significant drop in prices for services.
At that time, virtually all the countries where virtual operators came up were trying to protect their classical operators from their creations more or less.
Jimi's arguments were practically identical - too small, possibly too saturated market, problems with quality services etc.
In developed countries, but in these moments, regulatory authorities have been affected, not by the interests of mobile operators, but by their customers.
Whether by formal measures or by informal pressure, the first virtual operator was created and another one was added to it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are pushing the whole case like a hot potato.
From our experience, we can't get rid of the notion that incompetence is more than appropriate in these cases.
But let's not let the flint go to the grass.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator really appears to us soon, the Czech mobile market may be shifting again.
If any of the operators is created by a virtual mobile operator, it is only difficult for the UOHS to remain ineffective to reject (discrimination) other stakeholders.
And we must stop calling the fence than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymna has four new versions.
Select the best here
Listen to the four implementations of the new version of the Czech State Hymna.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Czech State's Day celebrated the new recordings of the State Hymna where my home.
Hymnu recently recorded the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávka.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in the congregation administration and instrumentation.
The song was captured by Catherine the Prince and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the ceremony are Otakar Jeremias and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
The résumé considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymen.
He had already told the Czech public that he had deliberately chosen to sing the salt variants of the singer with young representative voices, which are prominent and popular.
"From the beginning I was at both, and then I also tried to take care of the congregation so that they could have a clear dictate to understand the text well, to understand it," he said.
The Czech State Hymna will celebrate 175th anniversary next year.
The song where my home sounded first in 1834 on the slopes of Stavovský theatre in the original Czech game Fidlovak Josef Kajetán Tila complemented by Františko Škroupa music.
She gained popularity, and people took her for their own.
The first song then became a natural part of the State Hymna after the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of a separate Czech Republic.
How "new" Hymna sounds
Prague MDD in the middle of the first link and on the chip
Wednesday, 1 October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will be on the way to the metro, tram and buses, which will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At this point, he can arrange about a hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card.
Travelers can buy 30 days and 90 days and annual coupons (then will be paid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time allow to record on their digital card in the info centres and workshops of the Transport Company in the stations of the Museum, Městek, Nádraži Holešovice, Angel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zarada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be purchased from yesterday via the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
Service in the afternoon was used by over four hundred customers.
Those who start using the Internet can definitely forget the release window in the subway stations, where they had to be regularly on long fronts on paper trucks.
The coupon will buy it over the Internet and on the Opencard card it will be recorded in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places there is a passenger transfer with a trained service that will help interested people with online shopping and also record a coupon bought on their card," said the speaker of the Martin Opatrny project.
In addition to the books, it will be possible to record electronic coupons on Opencard also in self-service machines that are mounted in several vestibules of meters.
How do the machines look?
They are red, remind the riders of the riders and the travelers may already have noticed them at the stations of Roztyly, Budjejovicá, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five of them in town, but by the end of the year they should be eighty," the Guardian added.
The coupon controls the location of the automatic driver
The service of machines that start working tomorrow is simple.
Just insert an Opencard chip card into them and the first paid coupon will be recorded on it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are paid not only in the capital city, but also in its surroundings.
This means that in rural trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, which are driven to the capital city, mainly the inhabitants of the medieval municipalities.
"In the trains included in Prague's integrated transport, the guides are equipped with carts that determine the time and frequency of coupons," explained the control of the Filip Drápal from Ropid, which sets up the traffic rules of Prague's collective transport.
Domestic buses have read cards built in the store at the driver's office.
When performing, you need not only to show the driver a chip card, but also to add Opencard to a given place on the side of the treasure.
This controls the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If the traveller needs to verify the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking drivers for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not go by bus and will not remember when their coupon expires may return to self-service machines where the coupons are recorded on the card.
The information on the validity of their documents shall be displayed on the display of the device.
The judges wanted the US referendum.
In 1945, the Germans applied for the inclusion of Forests in the United States.
It comes from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South American scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under at least the patronage of the United States.
With such a wish, some groups of Germans allegedly turned to the president of the United States in 1945.
It follows, among other things, from a letter that was kept in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the University of Juhoče.
The Germans from the Czech Krumlov ask in a letter from the US President not to allow the return of the "shumbian parish" - banned by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to return to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation correctly and we really want to be sure of the words that the American units come into German territory, not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in a letter, signed by the word "People who are the judge of the Forest on the heart."
Because the accession to Czechoslovakia is allegedly giving the Soviet Germans - in the knowledge of Czech national nature - hope only of brutality, indifference, ignorance, oppression and slavery, the authors of the US President's letter asking him to take over the protection for the present and the present times over Shuma.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would admit this territory to us by a foreign country, which oppresses and expels minorities and destroys, hardly contribute anything to the victory of the Unions," the letter says.
The reason why authors can't sign is probably concern about the vengefulness of the "Cheese blockers".
If the president of the United States were to be suspicious of the thinking of the Germans, it would be sufficient for him to hold a referendum in the forest parish on whether its inhabitants want to become part of the United States or live under the auspices of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today’s knowledge of war history, according to some memoirs it is appropriate to conclude the then expectation of the Soviet Germans.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least be aware that they were going to deal with their withdrawal from the Republic, only a few of them allowed themselves such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate with the Sudets some kind of autonomy.
The others believed they'd just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in the Czech Buddhists.
He was a Buddhist German for the war on the Baltic Sea.
When he was arrested by the British at the end of the war and placed in a detention camp in Holshtyn, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach the Czechs.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would have the Czech cast," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, were to be removed from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't mean you'll pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive action focused on road safety in Czech history.
It would also characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleše Ribíčka's office promises her that she will take the driver away from the dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on TV, radio, movies, on the Internet, but also on flights.
She's supposed to get the driver out of the fast drive and the alcohol behind the wheel.
And also remind them to join them before they leave.
He wants to reach out to young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What's going to happen in the meetings?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign also bears witness to this:
You don't mean you'll pay!
The word "don't mean" is written in great letters on the expatriate.
And in the blood bag, the word "you'll pay."
This is to symbolize that a person can pay for his own life in a moment of neglect.
The audiences will be "fearing" until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of the victims of the accident can normally be seen.
He promises to reduce the accident and the number of dead on Czech roads.
Spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and bull on the driver
"There's a system of sugar and bees on the driver.
Sugar for them is that if they go to red, for example, they save time.
The bull is a threat of torment or accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says transport psychologist at the Hospital at Homolce Martin Korán.
And that's why there's a need for an information campaign in the press and mostly negative ads, my psychologist.
They are already less effective according to the table that alerts the drivers to danger.
"If a static table warning against danger is installed, it will probably soon be compatible with the environment and the drivers will not be committed to it," Kořán noted.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in return for peace
The President of the temporary Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, namely pre-Jordan, eastern Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in a conversation that was printed on Monday by Jediot Acronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all (occupied) territories will have to be returned unless at all," Olmert said.
"We'll have a certain percentage of these territories, but we'll have to give Palestinians a similar percentage (Israelian territory), because without that, there will be no peace," he added.
He allowed any return to include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and in particular does not want tractors or bulldozers to cross his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in an attack on two July attacks in a city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historic places", which lies within the Old City.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It won't work," he went on.
Departure from Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke for Israel's departure from the Golan Highs, which he considered to be an unimaginable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require a certain effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria only on the basis of the departure from Golan," he pointed out.
"The Sirens well know what they will have to give up to get the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship to Iran; they will have to give up their relationship to (the Shiite Movement) Hizballah; they will have to give up the ongoing support provided by terrorism (the Shiite Movement) to Hamas, (the terrorist network) Al-Qaeda and jihad (the Holy Wars) in Iraq," the Prime Minister explained.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law is unknown, walking on a long bus must not
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises as to whether stewards and passengers can move on the bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally abide by the law, the activity of the steward is contrary to the road traffic law," says the Transport Ministry spokesperson Karel Hanzelk.
The accident in which a 12-year-old driver died last week apparently caused a truck driver who crossed the road.
The girl was sitting next to the driver at the safest place in the car at the moment, although she has two more seats.
But the bus can crash, or jump fast, even at the moment that the steward spreads coffee or newspaper.
Role plays whether a bus is equipped with parking space according to the technical indication.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Remote buses Student Agencies do not have parking places; which is what Radim Janchura's director confirmed.
"We resolved this with the ministry, and the movement of travellers first was not allowed.
We then withdrew it and we have grown to the fact that passengers can walk to the toilet if they have their seat," he said.
The law of the steward doesn't know
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward - no legal provisions do so.
However, no legislation prohibits a carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the vehicle driver; it does not define its rights and obligations," says Hanzelka.
On the contrary, the Director of the Road Traffic Management Committee of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the issue of the law is sufficiently addressed.
"It depends whether the bus in the approval has a parking space allowed.
That's the end," he says.
Buses are divided into cities where there are parking spaces and the maximum speed limit, inter-urban with parking spaces with higher permitted speeds and remote without parking places with maximum permitted speeds and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in a plane, says an expert
The expert BESIP on transport safety Jaroslav Horín in the movement of motorists on the bus board does not see the main problem.
"When driving a lot of danger is in danger, the situation can be compared to service in aircraft.
It's not even safe here when turbulence comes and the plane can hit its head."
"However, if the bus would rush fast, of course physical laws apply.
Just like on a bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be addressed by internal regulations," he says, and also by default, from the point of view of the law, the problem is unsolved.
Janchura is willing to cancel the service
A student of the Agency offers stewards services as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
The Director does not consider their appointment to be a risk even after the accident.
"But as soon as I realize that the call from the stewards is risky, I will cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers can get passengers on the way.
It would save costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the absence of stewards in their cars was justified by the Asian director Alexey Litvin, who operates a break of lines compared to the SA.
"We don't have a stewardess, we've been standing against it from the beginning.
It will end sooner or later with some fatal injury," he said a year ago for Week.cz.
It's become an unbearable tragedy.
In the accident of a link connection to Naples, a young steward from Plzeňska died, who worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck was likely to break off without using the direction from the distance and blocked the bus path.
His driver tried to avoid a rough maneuver, but he failed the right front part of it.
To be sold out two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards, Janchura refuses.
"This place is not reserved for remote connections, are blocked."
The company is going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's spell, but the financial compensation is also expected of the guilty party.
The law's amendment?
Non-respective
The clarification of the movement of stewards on the bus board could bring about an amendment of the law to which a 30-year-old expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working over the year.
"There was no specific conclusion, however.
Buses don't even solve too much, rather a point system, maximum speed on the road and use mobile when handling," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards to be something that would in principle endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concludes, saying that the security control of buses is within the authority of the police and the employment security authorities.
Hope Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The large words in WestLB's statement to the employees of this bank are not missing.
The association of units of this Düsseldorf monetary institution with Frankfurt Deka-Bank will create "the central financial group institution set up for trade in capital markets," we will read in a letter received by the public on Monday.
According to the letter to this transaction, WestLB shall enter the "competence set" ensuring the long-term yield.
Such a connection can, at all times, be a decisive impulse for further mergers in the banking sector.
Such texts come into existence when a representative wants to demonstrate the ability to act during a time of trouble.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Commission but also on the part of the Spolska Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, which has been notified by the Government of North Westphalia that it is now time to find a solution for the future, is still fresh.
The connection between the Deka-Bank, which customers are familiar with for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever its kind, has been talking for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
Chief Deka-Bank Franz Waas, in presenting the half-year results of the management at the end of August, made it clear that in the merger of his home from Mainzer Landstraße with some of the country's banks, such as Helab or WestLB, there is no sense.
The Deka-Bank Governing Council, which is composed of one half of the country's bank and the other of the bond, has, however, entrusted the board with conducting discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be a business on the capital market or part of it.
However, the talks were just beginning, and the financiers were starting.
Deka-Bank, which is one of the most important employees on the financial market in Frankfurt with its 3000 employees, is not the first to speak about consolidation in the compound sector.
In 2003, it seemed that it might be possible to merge Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and with Helab.
There was no end of this three-piece.
Shortly after the merger plans were made public, the Hessen Land government spoke against the participation of Helab Bank.
Neither of the remaining banking houses did that.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz received Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart instead.
However, speculation about the connection of the Deka-Bank with the country's banks has appeared over and over again.
In recent times, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the Helab Bank's representation, expressed negatively to speculation about the connection of his financial house with others.
It seems, however, that regardless of this, the belief that the convergence of different banking houses in the public sector is necessary.
Now, after the elections to the country snow in Bavaria, the first thing could be to figure out the BayernLB connection to Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
That's not exactly good news for Helab.
If pressure is to increase to further fusions, it is gradually becoming possible partners for such mergers.
In the south, it would only play a second puzzle, even though the financial crisis is so far far far better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the association with WestLB was banned by Svaz Sporijtelen and the jury banks of Hessen-Thüringen, which had a 50 per cent stake in Helaba.
That's what Nord LB would look like.
The geostrategic considerations of this species are, however, only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much business models of individual institutions are sailing together.
In June Merl announced that the decisive question which business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the Land Banks, the German bonded bond and the jury banks had not yet answered.
Everything could also end with the deployment of WestLB, which, of course, nobody wants in this institution.
That's why the letter from the D.A. also speaks of trying to "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect individual files to the Deka-Bank, it will show time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "the weekend of Italy"
It's for Elena first, for Lucus third or fourth.
But this time Elena's gonna be like his girlfriend, and then everything's gonna be different, he says.
Behind them, in a five-litre court, the Kaiser brand stands a stronger lift and two hundred tourists at Octoberfest proves how deep the tone can release his throat.
Elena Lucu will dance first and then kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus park next to the Puorta Nuova station, four buses with the designation "Destinazione Monaco, Festa della birra", are expected to arrive at 6.30 this evening.
Three buses contain, above all, the Italians, in one bus, exclusively the Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans sing with their flag, they've been celebrating at night.
And so out loud, says Marco Guard, it's nothing for Italy.
Marc, who's got a long coat on his head with a leather strap and a glasses with a wide silver rings, these three buses belong.
He's been driving with them for five years at Octoberfest, only this year he's having three trips.
The night over there, the day between the beer stands, at 22.30 p.m. back.
Overnighting would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The road is worth 75 euros, including a welcome drink by Kaiser, which is cooked exactly according to the Bavarian Law on the purity of beer, health insurance and the German speaking guide - Marco went to Frankfurt for a language course.
Buses leave in the night, along the road to Brennero.
Beer doesn't give up, not yet.
The bus is very quiet, the passenger sleeps.
They're doing well, they're still gonna need their powers.
It is located in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on the 8-piece street front of Munich another stop and many other buses with an Italian flag.
When Marc's group finally arrives in the parking lot near Theresienwiese, as planned at mid-morning, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has the last speech, explains the attack plan.
First: Put on a yellow hat.
On her left is written "Oktoberfest", next to the internet address of Marc's travel office: "conscersiviaggiando.it".
The second is, "When the door is opened to the beer store, run away!" Marco calls out to the early air.
"Go!" Go and store the seats in the back of the estate.
"Not forward, so that you don't cross, and not all the yellow pieces on the same side, move around the space!"
It's worth 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the sprites.
"Show the securitists that we are being polite.
Once you leave your places, they're gone!"
Third, "This evening, exactly in the eleventh place, be here again!" Do you understand?
And rise to Wiesn, room with beer.
One member of the group hangs yellow hats as marks on trees, cedars and even on the election poster of one big bavor party.
We need to get ready for the retreat.
As a weekend with Italy, it's the second weekend of October.
Accurate information on the number of visitors is not available; it is about fifty thousand people who are on their way to the Alps and fall into beer states, ten percent of all visitors arrived from Italy this weekend.
A number of Munich police force forces seven South Tyrol policemen, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads to national statistics, in which the Italians before Britain (approximately 60 attacks) and Rakušany (approximately 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments occupy the first place.
It's especially popular with the Italian state of Hofbrau.
No Nights for Believers Hypo Real Estate
Even last week, the Finance Minister of Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
It is good that this policy has used the word "relatively" and has included in its claim the fact that the German banking sector will not remain the subject of crisis development.
Because it was the last weekend.
The index of Dax, a financial house specialising in the financing of Hypo Real Estate (HRE), will receive loans from a consortium of German banks in the amount of several billion to protect against turbulence on the market.
The person informed of the situation on Monday told Reuters that this loan aid would go up to EUR 35 billion.
The commissions will have to pay Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from the amount actually exhausted.
Money may also come from private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of Depfa's subsidiary.
According to the news report, this state financier has been refinancing for extremely short-term long-term projects, which is no longer possible due to the lack of confidence in markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve dropped by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and the share of its own capital decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45%.
Current income and net income from financial transactions against last year fell to zero, income from increased receivables and from certain securities, as well as from the cancellation of credit trading reserves fell by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Thanks only to the higher return on the subsequent accounting costs for the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the return on interest under the tax order and to the aid of trade for the companies concerned, the sixteen per cent reduction on the income side was still moderated.
The former state financier, after his privatisation in 1990, burned himself on mortgages for the tenants who were then removed from the portfolio of services and then led by Aareal Bank.
Since classical state funding was too low, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects by private investors and the State (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and was diversified internationally.
From the value of their subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate now has to write something and these copies will have "essential material effect" to calculate the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have let themselves be heard.
The fact is, the dividend is not going to be.
By 2007, two thirds had been cut short.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financial operator for state and infrastructure projects since Depf was taken over.
More strongly than other institutions depend on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of the U.S. Investment Bank, Lehman Brothers practically raised the bank's loan gap two weeks ago, because banks are monitoring liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a year for part of the Depfa credit portfolio - about €50 billion - short-term refinancing funds.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financial needs of the group are covered by this loan over a period of time and the company is protected "before the influence of international money markets currently to a significant extent of inability to function".
Other sources were reported to have provided refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE Chairman Georg Funke announced that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets at the time.
The Spolko Bank and the Spolko Institute for Financial Services Supervisory (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group is now ensured on the market.
That's what the shareholders and the bank's believers hope for.
But in view of the dynamics and invulnerability of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even completely excluded that the loan should not be fully exhausted.
But you can't rule out the opposite.
After the bank's early Sunday afternoon, as it stood before the insolvency, it can't be pre-emptive, saved to calm the thirst.
The share price fell by 75 per cent to EUR 3.30.
On the contrary, the bond courses were well held.
While priority debts have not moved in practice, they lose the course of other bonds more prominently.
This concerns in particular the bonds of the former subsidiary of Württemberg Hypo and the logical bonds with the maturity period after 2009.
The Hypo-Real-State bonds initially looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be followed by a significant focus on the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself, which brought it into the company by taking over Depf, to understand depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the banks, governments and the less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to calculate the value of the securities within their maturity.
However, there can also be what almost no one at the moment is looking forward to - in the next 15 months, the financial crisis will be overcome.
However, in view of the reports that are currently coming with this partial accession, the only legitimate hope is that the border with certainty is likely to become.
Especially to long-term believers, it is likely that they will prepare a number of awake nights when they will decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the margin at least to create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to the short-term income of later years for the purpose of future payment of capital income tax.
Sylvana and secret of the box Bento
When the sixteen-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop's first day at the high school in Tahibana, girls start to brag: the German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the mang. On his new blog about the exchange stay, she will report on Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I've been pushed from my way to school.
I live in the country of Tokyo, heading to Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to the center of Tacibana.
I had to find my own way, and luckily I didn't lose.
It doesn't seem that the beginning of Tacibana's education is as hard as our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eight hours and twenty minutes before the ninth starts a short session with a teacher, so called 'home room'.
But before teaching started, I was supposed to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk to people, but 40 students in front of class.
'Cause I haven't had a school uniform yet, 'cause I took on the old dress of my host mother, to this blouse, blue knees and black leather boots.
So I set myself up in front of the bench and tried to say everything right: 'Sajonara Wo even Sylvan...' - my name is Sylvan, I come from Germany, and I have my birthday in a week.
At the time, I was very happy to start learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were sneaking around, chichotala and mavala, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my jaws.
It belongs to the basic word tool of Japanese girls needed for survival and means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I got into my place fast.
The girl next to me smiled a lot, she thought it was an honor to have a foreign student sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was rather quiet, but when the gang called, I was literally asleep.
They talked through each other and chichotals and asked me about possible and impossible - and then it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then they all got their bows on the stop.
My host mother also made me such a box for lunch - and that's something else than boring German candles.
I had rice with herbs, little pies, salads and raisins, fruit and some kind of fish in the tofu cake.
Most people don't even know what's right here in Japan.
These things look special and taste pretty new.
Of course, everything's really good.
Well, maybe to the salt-loaded sweatshirts, no!
Benta at Japanese schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives the boy a self-prepared bento, which in this case is particularly artist-adjusted, and hopes that the boy in the kitchen will know more about the break.
I read about it in my comic books.
I'm curious if I can see it here, too.
'Why is Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
After all, I've loved reading manga for years.
And to understand these comics and their culture better, I started learning Japanese once.
So it was quite clear to me that I would have to come here once.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, habits and habits.
And you're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other, is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
And the rats have feelings
When a mouse or a sponge escapes danger, does that mean they also feel afraid?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings.
But how can it be verified if they feel the same way we do?
The online magazine "Edge" has been publishing the contributions of well-known scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in his series presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else who has ever been able to prove, if we can't even prove that they have other people of consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope because all human brains have a consistent basic configuration.
However, once we start to dedicate ourselves to another kind and open up the questions of perception or general awareness, we enter the indiscriminate field because the hardware does not match.
When the mouse gets in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it's supposed to be dead, pushed or attacked.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists detract from comparable subjective survival.
I don't believe it, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure facilitate the transfer of our subjective life to animal life.
However, this is because the circuits associated with human knowledge almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its share in short-term memory and performance or management functions).
This vast area is much more developed in man than in other primates, and other creatures seem to be quite lacking.
At least in the aspects of our knowledge, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, the knowledge among them who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from other primitives.
Another dramatic feature could conceal a person’s language essence: because so much of his perception is linked to language, it is often said that knowledge depends on him.
In this case, we could exclude the animals.
But even if knowledge of the language did not matter, it would surely affect the language, so that animal knowledge, regardless of its design, would probably differ from most of the opinions of our knowledge.
So it's hard to find out what it looks like in other animals.
When, as an internal and subjective one, it is not even possible to measure, because of the special hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experience, it makes us examine it in the face of major problems.
Most of my outputs relate to the content of the conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of the knowledge that should be available to the scientific soul.
It would be possible to examine processes in animal consciousness regardless of their content, and that is precisely what is happening in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But this approach, dedicated to Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses on the neural roots of consciousness rather than causal mechanisms: they can both be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of a non-frontier cortex for visualisation.
What's behind this feeling?
I export them from the fact that an emotional system, such as a fear system, is activated in the brain by the knowledge of its own activities.
What we call "fear" is the mental state in which we are in when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) uses operational memory.
From this angle, feelings are closely linked to those areas of cortex that are characterized by primates, and especially people.
In connection with the language nature, there is a fine reflection of perception, because we can distinguish and categorize states by words and grammar, so that we can attribute them to each other.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from the most primitive activities in cortex areas and the family of the brain, such as Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Because this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could share peacefully in the feelings of multiple animal species.
I can't resist it theoretically, but I think it's invincible.
Panxeep argues that what appears to us in rats and people as fears is likely to feel the same way: How is it possible to verify, says Panxeep, whether the rats and people feel the same when they behave similarly?
He's afraid too?
From my point of view, only the similarity of behavior can prove the compatibility of living.
It is true that the neural comparison continues: the rats and people have similar brain stems, on the contrary, not brainwashing.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it was possible to prove it to man: how would we want to prove it to the rat?
I believe that rats and other frogs, perhaps even wet (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how I should prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I'd rather examine emotional behavior than emotional perception of the cross.
In any case, in this case, we can wait for progress at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Just as I don't study language and knowledge at the cross, I don't study feelings, but I don't know if they exist.
It's possible to view it as short-sighted, but I'd rather go ahead before I throw myself over and over against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Period of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said preparations will soon be directed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise ME together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"But it's not amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is much more to do in both countries."
In the timely implementation of the schedule of construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are kneeling down.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We need to work as quickly as possible now," said the President of the Ukrainian Union Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep watching us."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN was revoked after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlock.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewiecko.
There is a "serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act in accordance with the rules," the Polish press agency PAP told Drzewiecki.
"UEFA President Michel Platini's letter assures us that this step will not result in preparation for ME 2012."
Several teams from the first league were only sentenced to forced retirement in the last season, and finally had to move the beginning of the league.
Encouraging Dennis Quaid Returns Attack
She wanted to advertise a new film, talk about private matters - and now she has problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her former Dennis Quaid as a marriage breaker.
That's the burning and returning blow.
The late war rose at the former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors have a bad fight - in front of the public's eyes.
Meg Ryan, in his interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, first said for the reasons of her marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She learned about the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
The emphasis on this mental stripty was the PR work of Ryan for her new film "The Women" - the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was significant: "It's crazy," said a 40-year-old actor from New York Daily News, "Meg relives the history of our relationship and adjusts it".
In addition, it's "politician" that to Jack's son, sixteen-year-old, once again "is a public reminder of the pain and radical changes that are a divorce for every child."
While Ryan lives alone from divorce, Quaid is again married and recently became a father of twins.
His mind on moving is like, "My life goes on anyway.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's doing great."
Prices of flights and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to one current study, in Germany there were up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and accommodation in hotels again took place - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its data on the bookings made in the first half of 2008 and found their significant decrease in the second quarter after the rise in prices in the first quarter.
After several years of price increases on the hotel market, housing in many places has already been exhausted.
Between January and March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities observed, on average, by 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most careful trend was in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
For the reason of this trend, American Express considers a weak dollar course, which has caused "the taste of American tourists to travel".
The decline in hotel prices was also more severely affected by the financial centres than by the industrial centres, such as Hanover, Kolín nad Rýn or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, the prices of hotels increased by 26.3 percent even recorded a European record.
Flight prices also showed a further upward trend in the first quarter:
Because of the deterioration of kerosene, passengers in the Economist class had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-range flights had to pay up to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of flights in the Economy class decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but changes in the Business and First-Class classes were less significant.
In Germany, prices fell even higher than in other European countries:
Between January and March, 11.9 percent of the population in the second quarter fell by 23.6 percent.
In the German national years, according to the study quoted, prices fell even half.
One of the reasons for this price fall is slowing economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market does not exist.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure on Open Skies, which liberalises air traffic between the USA and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the collapse of non-profit lines by air carriers and also the high number of air carriers that announced the competition in the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV channel Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to a single branch and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the front of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to make up a working eleven.
He wrote Kristoff Klein - to increase Unsuccessful landings for the representative of Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach got into the game late and didn't hit the ball on the stick.
His message was accurately formulated and pronounced out of his mouth with conviction.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger in a walk to the Hamburg Arena cabin.
It didn't do much in the catacombs, the break between half-times ended, and most people were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and has been more respectful than a lot of instant actors.
And so his request was also heard at the responsible place.
Coach Cornelius Jol's assistant approached and pulled a finger on the sign of the agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Master Coach Martin Jola.
His command must have sounded the same: I'm here with the second round!
It didn't work out.
"It didn't look good here today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have been "wanted to be more relaxed."
For 1:0 (1:0) Hamburcan thanks to Mladen Petrić's head (11) and the circumstances that very weak hungry could not harm poor Hamburcans.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV this Monday celebrates 121 years of its existence.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and the living updated table on the video scene, where their team was mentioned as a premiere.
They're going to be birthdays without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcel Jansen.
They think that the continuous tabloid result symbolizes the incompatibility of the league rather than the domination of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - the Nevese and Silvy Brazilians, the Petrić and the FC Bayern whites from Jansen - are slowly located, but can't shine yet.
"We need more sense and more dribbling," Jol said.
After the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
The first reports of the flooding of the rescue package caused a decrease of the Dow Jones index to 700 points.
It was the greatest point of loss within one day in his history.
Later, Dow got something back.
Around 20.30, this most important world stock exchange barometer showed a 5% decrease of 10,579 units.
Nasdaq's technological stock exchange was with more than seven percent minus 1548 points.
The worst was in Dow at this point in the American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and the Bank of America lost about twelve percent.
None of the titles have been able to strengthen.
Goldman Sachs' stock has lost almost ten percent.
A few days ago, Warren Buffett had a stake in this company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called damaged mortgages.
However, the total amount should not be paid back, but in several stages.
The payment shall be made on the basis of a separate list of financial companies which could be paid in favour of the course, thereby reducing the burden on the State budget.
Action courses in Europe fall sharply
The billion aid to banks in Europe and the USA is not beyond doubt.
The course of action of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is highly advanced and downloads the Dax index with it.
The American index of Dow Jones also loses despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank hit the German stock index (Dax) deep down.
The shares of the said bank-owned bank-owned property have also lost up to three quarters of its value through the rescue of the stock government and private banks, Commerzbank has lost more than 20 per cent.
Dax clearly closed below the psychologically important limit of 6,000 points and with a minus 3.7 percent recorded 5,839 points.
All over the world, the stock markets went to the knees.
In New York, he began a business day on Wall Street with significant losses.
Investors are afraid that the US government's savings package of 700 billion dollars would not have to be sufficient for the recovery of facts on the financial markets.
Down during the first hour of trading lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, and that's 10,809,25 points.
The United States of America's representatives are to vote on a rescue plan, the Senate could speak on 1 October.
The other European stockpiles were killed only in one direction: in London the FTSE index was first weakened by 3.2 per cent, the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the Japanese leading index for Nikki dropped by 1.26 percent to 11 743.61 units after initial gains.

The private bank of Sal. Oppenheim signed 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook do not sell.
Dark mass affects the flight of space probes
For years scientists have not known how to deal with one mysterious phenomenon: the dark mass affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver (gravitation brush).
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general relativity theory should not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through the universe.
The guilt of fuel management, which will soon freeze, now threatens her with the death of winter.
Among scientists for years, one mysterious phenomenon has affected the confusion - anomaly of gravity.
Gravitational dust is an aerial maneuver of space probes, where they gain additional mobility in the gravitational field of some space body, such as the Earth.
That's why the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What scientists have been saying for years in this case is that flying bodies are not kept to a degree as expected by the old law of gravity.
On the contrary, there is an irregularity in speed.
The probes are speeding up or slowing down.
It has not been able to explain this effect to the physicists so far.
He was baptized by anomaly of gravity.
Several experts are afraid that even the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein, which describes the attractiveness of mass by curved space, would not have to be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not wrong and is trying to explain the anomalies of gravity through so-called dark mass, whose presence in the universe has been detected by astronomers.
"The responsibility for this anomaly could be a dark mass that could also be found very close to the Earth," she writes.
The existence of dark matter is only known by space researchers for about ten years.
It is obviously a gravitational force whose effect on other universe bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, she is completely invisible, which means she does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
According to scientists, this dark mass is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt, the kidnapping of tourists is free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs in Egypt, tourists are taken back to freedom.
The arrests from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
When the shooter was released, six kidnappings were killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The deal on the ransom is already in progress.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of kidnappings.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourist attractions on the Sahara are, according to all, free.
Egyptian state television, Arabic Al-Arab television station and Italian media were informed accordingly.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to reports of the Italian television station Sky TG 24, confirmed the release: "Our associates and other hostages were released.
We're just checking their health status," Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian State TV, there are five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian leaders in good and safe.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are already on their way to Kahiry.
The unclear remains the background of the shooter before the handcuffs were released: according to the Egyptian security officer, the kidnappings were prepared to end the kidnapping even before the Sudanese army suddenly killed six prisoners.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the ransom," the quoted worker said.
It's been "just going to take over the hostages," when all of a sudden "this surprise" came.
On Sunday in the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, the Sudanese soldiers shot six prisoners, and two of them were captured.
The kidnappers applied for a six-million-euro ransom for Germany; the German wife was to be handed over to one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" with a call to one of the German mediators stated that the release of hostages is spreading because the kidnappers are afraid of their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappings wanted to be missed by women's guardians after the payment of the ransom.
Men were to be kept until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
My father's abuse led to suicide.
Several years of fatherly abuse led a woman to kill herself, to be found before the court.
After admitting eight cases of sexual harassment, seven-year-old Michael Treise from Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro has heard that his own daughter, Stephanie Randle, was regularly tied up when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Treise wrote in a statement.
It was also said in court that Miss Randle was killed at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Treise tied her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in the house.
Treise and his wife divorced in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His own daughter went to Plymouth.
However, before the trial, it was announced that Ms. Randleo, who had spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, had followed the example of abuse that had been inflicted twice a week on her.
Judge Ramsey Quaife stated in court that in 2006 Ms. Randle's friends, who were also very devoted to surfing and cycling, that she was "emotionally dead" and that "she gave up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's supposed to have drowned in an igelite bag.
Randle stood face to face with his own father, who wrote a statement that ended up saying, "I hugged her and blinded her eyes.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said, "You're an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been horrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his life.
Even worse is the fact that if she didn't do so, the case would probably not have been brought to court."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the consequences of your crime on their daughter in those years, according to Stephanie's parents," he added.
"It would probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The official who has lost his data will be accused
The BBC has learned that a government official who left a very secret document on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two very secret documents on the Waterloo train at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
Before the police were handed over, the documents got into the hands of the BBC.
It is at least a serious violation of that law and does not imply a criminal intention.
BBC writer Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought that the matter was being settled internally between the ministry and the Government's Office," he said.
An employee who is not to be appointed shall be charged under section 8.1 of the law in question, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police officer complain on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained the secret analyses of Al-Qaida and the possibility of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown place.
Social reserves are in line with the debt of B&B
The British social trust may have to spend more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided 2.6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley 14 billion libre for deposit protection.
The loans will be paid by all companies that receive client deposits, including 59 social foundations.
The Director-General of the Association of Societal Foundations (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "submissive", that depositors and their members must pay.
The 14 billion-dollar debt will finally be paid by saving Bradford & Bingley's mortgages.
However, the interest that is set aside in the meantime will pay every year to all 700 financial corporations that receive customer deposits.
The Bank's cash compensation plan confirmed that all 59 social bases are included in this item.
It is humiliating that these institutions, which have acted seriously... must now pay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so serious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company was to pay in proportion to the deposits it held and that the deposits were to pay about 18 % of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the increase from debt to $450 million in 2009.
This means that deposits will have to find 81 million pounds to pay interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Societies, told the BBC that he was convinced that it was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that were taking a serious look at the housing market must now pay some of the accounts of those institutions that were not so serious."
According to the BSA, there has been no deposit since 1945, when it appeared.
"We will have to look into all aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what are the possibilities of protecting social security and their members from the account that could be significant," Cole added.
The judgment applicable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest will be paid over the year and that could be almost twice as much.
In view of the fact that the shareholdings are shareholdings without shareholders, this account will finally pay their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk contains 5 pence per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Ms. Jersey announced that she would increase the wholesale price of her milk by five cents per litre from Monday.
This year it's the second price increase, after two-penny losses in February, and comes after the research carried out by the consulting company.
Retailers should decide on their own whether they want to reflect the distortion at customer prices.
Before the fall, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last changed in 2002.
Guadeloupe for Bangladeshi expremier rejected
The Bangladesh court rejected the application of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vadzid for bail release, which means that if he returns to power, he may be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her for bail in connection with the charge that she had obtained from a certain entrepreneur over fifty million such ($729,700) when she was a prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges brought against it.
Chalda Zija, a long-standing political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released earlier this month on bail.
Sheikh Hasina is to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the League (Awami League), asked her local army to give her full freedom first.
Writers say that while she was allowed to speak in an honest manner in order to take part in a foreign medical procedure, it is not clear whether she will remain free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that the Supreme Court's regulation is now being appealed to the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the application by Sheikh Hasina for bail in that he does not need bail when the foreign investigation is under way for an honest declaration," said her defender Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall appeal against the Rules of the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers claimed she needed bail so that she could return to the country for preparation for the December elections.
The High Representative of the League of People said that Sheikh Hasina should return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the army held by the temporary government took over power, but she was released from prison in June so that she could go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Chalda Zija both reject all charges brought against themselves.
Fear of anti-rightness in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children did not participate in the recent flat-rate campaign against the Taliban-related violence.
Last week, the United Nations conducted a census in six provinces.
However, he says that for security reasons, children in the South could not be reached in Helmand and Kandahar.
The United Nations spokesperson stated that even through the Taliban's promises, it would not attack or defend thousands of obstetric workers at work.
BSkyB lost the ITV court dispute
BSkyB has lost the court hearing on the review of the Commission’s competition decision, which has been ordered by the company to reduce its share in the competitive broadcast of ITV.
The Board of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its share in ITV from 17,9 % below 7,5 %.
The Commission has previously declared that the share of BSkyB has dreamt of a competitive fight and has had an disproportionate impact on ITV.
BSkyB bought the share in 2006 in a trade that, as a result of the banning of NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Authority announced that the acquisition of ITV participation in BSkyB had caused doubts about ITV independence and called on the Commission to initiate the investigation.
The director of the Virginia Consortium Sir Richard Branson, consumer organization and regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was unreasonable and as a disproportional solution - above all because BSkyB had previously said that it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation of the affair of American lawyers
The US Prime Minister appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
This was the case when the affair report prepared by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticised the activities of government officials.
The report criticised officials of the White House, legislature and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzalez.
The investigation was prompted by the concern that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials of the investigation were lying to the investigators in order to justify justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine stated in the report: "The serious complaints, including potential criminal proceedings, were not fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the authority to bring witnesses to speak was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the US Ministry of Justice dismissed nine American lawyers in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry stated that the lawyers had been released for poor performance.
However, later it became clear that the release of lawyers was not judged to be anything worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the complaint of the highly-established Republican MPs and senators, while others refused to investigate the accusations of fraud against the Democrats.
U.S. lawyers are investigating and bringing charges in court cases against the government.
They may be released at any time, but they must not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, got himself fired and finally resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice has also risen.
The Commissioner-General's report on the role of Gonzales in the affair was very critical, saying that he carried the "main responsibility" for the release of "abdicating" from his leadership and in fact "not necessarily engaged".
Other officials, including former High Councillor Bush Karl Rowe, were criticised for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loafo's department will be appreciated
The Rock Star Meat Loaf will get one of the Q Awards prizes for its epic Hymnu Bat Out Of Hell.
A singer who will come to London next weekend for his special gold prize said he was "honored" with recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title song of the 1977 hit album Meat Loaf.
This year's nomination is led by the Coldplay Group, which has been selected in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed the big vocals that Meat Loaf provided.
It started an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached the highest in the 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell album held around nine years and sold it all over the world more than forty million copies.
Meat Loaf, a real name Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from health problems in recent years and in 2003 has also been operated due to irregular heart beats after the stage collapse.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
Later it turned out he had a cyst on his vocals.
Obesity streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, roads and other terrestrial communications, some famous, others only useful.
But even many veterans and long-term locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, most of them because they never heard of it.
This small street is in the quarter East Village and leads north of First Street - without getting on Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about 10 and a length of 40 meters, it is more like an empty passage than a transport trail.
There's no cedula called the street.
It's practically invisible in the ordinary atlas.
However, he has a street of admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
He wants Extra Place to redesign and create a cleaner transition to shops and shops that are to be opened in new buildings.
Other admirers are the long-lasting neighbors who say they were short-lived in the street simply because it was one of the last remains of the time before the block was destroyed.
However, the City Protection and Development Office, which has a street in its power, has no interest in keeping it.
At the meeting of the General Community Land Committee, the representatives of the City Office and Avalon Bay planned a plan that would allow developers to buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the Community’s district manager, 3 the Committee prefers the option when the streets remain in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be put in place next month.
"The city already owns only very few lands, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its ownership," she said.
"Proposals for correction and administration could be made, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that a small street wanted to redesign and sit in places for a meeting, from which several would use a café whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to use the street, it doesn't have to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to repair this abandoned street and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale proposed the city.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson for the Foundation's Conservation Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and he suggested that the purpose of his office was to develop the property rather than manage.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a small mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when the big farm of Philip Minthron was divided between several of his children and no one made a claim on that narrow road of the country.
To Extra Place, the back door of CBGB, a punktock monument that closed in 2006, and the street is perhaps the most famous as the background of photography on the album of Ramones group "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a wonderful place," says Danny Fields, manager Ramones, who took a photo in November 1976.
"It was full of waste, torn clothes and pieces of bars, posters, sheets and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers, who write about honoring the East Village neighborhood, face the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that it is a piece of public property, be secret, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place to be a rarity - almost unchanged part of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog on behalf of Jeremiah of New York (with the title "The Book of Kidneys: a bitter nostalgic view of the city in the process of reconciliation"), related part of the story about Extra Place from the section Talking of the City, which appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
Author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind street, dark even on the day and restricted by the narrow iron doors of the warehouses and closed windows, where the old newspaper runs through the streets for a week."
Except for a few exceptions, the street of one recent evening looked exactly the same.
The cross went through the blind end of the street near the doors that once led to CBGB, where today there is a trade in expensive clothing.
There were graffiti on the walls, and beside the fresh dose of the paper, there was an empty brewer.
A couple of college students said they think about Extra Place a little, but they suggested that some kind of boost could be given to him.
On the contrary, Fields said that they think that some people underestimate the activity of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in places of darkness, moisture and resistance."
Bilinguality debate: English subduction
In this section, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic officer from California and the director of the field of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Better Than You Think: Why Secondary Class Need to Choose Schools".
Effectively addressing Hispanic voters is an ominous matter.
Barack Obama's educational agenda just proves it.
Obama's campaign suggests that "Afro-American and Hispanic students have a significantly lower probability that they are worth more than white students," which is true.
In order to fight with such performance differences, Obama promotes the educational agenda, especially for those who are only learning English, "previous bilingual education".
However, the question of Barack Obama remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on using languages other than English, is not more powerful than his interest in reducing performance differences in the class.
Let's take the example of Sixth Street Prep, the charter primary school in the Los Angeles East.
The students of this school are, in general, in most cases, the Hispanic from low-copier families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom came from just recently, are only learning English.
Even so, in the 2008 state mathematics tests, an incredible percentage of fourth-class students reached the highest level.
Nearly ninety-three percent of fourth-class students were reached at the highest level in English-language and literature state tests.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and exercise, constant assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
In addition, and Obama should take note of this, according to Linda Mikels, director of the Sixth Street, the pedagogical approach of the school for those who are only learning English, is "full humiliation".
Undermining in English underlines the almost essential use of English when teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said to me, "We had a great success with one completely new student from Mexico - after twelve months you would enter the class and not know what it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take the school as a Sixth Street Prep as an example of how other schools with large Spanish and English students should look?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear from the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association is a long-standing advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education undermines Obama’s prediction of the answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently triviad when he declared that people should stop worrying about "English only" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure that your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to reduce performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational issues that work rather than make fun of them and trivialize them.
The oil is falling sharply due to renewed economic fears
The oil prices fell on Monday yesterday because of the fears that even an American plan to save financial markets would not have to bring the economy back to life.
The price of fixed oil trades dropped by 7 per cent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning trading at the New York Comedy Stock Exchange.
Since last Monday, prices have dropped by more than $20 a barrel.
In the last two weeks, markets with comets have been cut off by financial anxiety on Wall Street and also by two strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, the price fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, which again jumped to the huge uncertainty of financial markets.
The anxiety rebounded on the investors on Monday, even after the Congress Presidency announced that the weekend had reached agreements on the biggest rescue plan in history.
This report was fueled by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the most recent episode of the divorce, the government announced that the Citigroup would purchase the Banking Department of Wachovia Corporation.
Between Belgium, the Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially replaced the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts of Barclays Capital said that a crazy weekend conversation that led to a plan to save the economy "are shown as unable to revive the mood on the market".
As the economic situation worsens, the demand for commodities, including oils, is expected to decline.
"The prospects for markets with global shares, interest rates and monetary exchange rates have been greatly defeated," analysts from Deutsche Bank wrote to investors in the report.
"We believe that the Commodities will not be able to avoid the plague.
From a comet perspective, our greatest concern is to what extent the American virus is spreading throughout the world and especially to China."
The analysts of this bank limited their expectations for next year, as oil consumption decreased due to slow economic growth and reduced their forecasting of gas prices by about 20 % for 2009.
The wild ride in the second quarter won the team record
After spending the last eight seasons in the Jets dress more than anyone else, the defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything.
Then on Sunday, he followed the development of the second quarter in which Jets changed the play of free in a Spanish ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after Jets and the Arizona Cardinals were leveled by the dark clouds over themselves.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranueuse Colese to a twelve-day touch-and-sprint, which perfectly marked the afternoon, in which their progressive cooperation moved about a mile ahead.
Favre sent Colese in this quarter behind the other two touchdowns, including the one in which the cornererback fell, and another 10 seconds before the mid-war.
"It was nothing extraordinary," said Favre about all his recordings to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
It's been a great communication, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were thrown away, the defense attacked Cardinals Kurt Warner's quarterback.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught the wrong hole and returned it by 32 yards to touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith tipped out another tape and caught her.
Linebacker David Bowens donated Warner to the fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens blew, was probably the best.
Team Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, dug Jay Feely's twenty-yard goal out of the field, and got the lead 34-0.
That's the best Jets ever got in one quarter.
The Jets Eric Mangini, when he was called to describe the madness, said, "The second quarter, or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed 21 points without answer in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
A drop of many points in a short period of time."
Retired Gebreselas improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie from Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the best distance runner even when on Sunday in the Berlin marathon he crossed his own world record and became the first man to run 26.2 miles of race under two hours and four minutes.
The victory on a pleasantly flat track in time 2:03:59 changed in 27 seconds his previous time 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - won the world record or is at least the world's champion at all distances from the metro mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie escaped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, because he was afraid - from a look back perhaps too scared - that the polluted air would solve his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - the sun and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the goal - won the week Gebreselassie with a blizzard average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What the tram runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on the longer track, dropped the marathon record in the last decade for more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselas told reporters that he had two weeks ago a jumper in the air and missed a week of training.
The break was obviously more exciting than it was held back.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselas said to the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, the Eastern African rival Ethiopia - for planning his races excessively, generally avoided by the world's marathon peaks, relied on guides, as if it were a race on the track, and built world records on the meaning of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's enormous running quality.
Held in the tempo by four Kenyans reached Gebreselassia half of the time 1:02:04.
After the leaders fell away, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite racers James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
About something before three miles before the goal of Gebreselassia last took and fled to Kwambai, who then reached second place at 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum in about five minutes.
Kamathi finished the third at 2:07:48.
In the race women finished the excellent year at the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitínk, a relative from Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen.
Record time 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
The 16-year-old Mikitínk suddenly won last year in the spring in London's marathon at 2:24:14.
Beijing's games left for something that was described as a back injury, but she recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon, which she used to run, improved her personal maximum in almost five minutes.
She ran the race wisely and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners escape into a big jump and then reached about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Ascale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia ran the second for 2:21:31 and Helen Kippov from Kenya finished the third at 2:25:01.
Hedgehogs and obstacles to the life of blacks in a separate city
Hidden among the famous Orlando amusement park, several miles from everything bright, loud and glorious, lies a quiet city in which the pride and the desire of African American life relives.
Eatonville, the first completely black town that was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three Crockett chrysus, three hundred browns, three hundred good swimmers, a supply of quays, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a resort.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Zora festival to make up the gift of Hurston, the most famous female writer of Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a party, even though she stopped it for tourists by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the thirties when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their real feelings with a white man who "knows us so little that he doesn't even know what's coming."
Even today, in a year when the Montenegrin presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on race, many of the inhabitants of the country remain cautious of foreign views.
"We are paying great attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here from birth and is a member of the city's oldest farce.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as the paradox of triumph and narration.
It is both a historical model of Montenegro's rise, and a community of almost 2400 people, where the poverty rate is double against the international average.
It is a medium-sized literature, but also an example of the shade of the South American rural black culture - sometimes challenged, sometimes praised - that came from American slavery.
It's not too surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and protective.
And the concern about Eatonville's show really started with Zoro, which is the only way the Hurstons call it.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her heart-filled book "Mules and Men (Mules and Men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (their eyes followed God)" (1937).
Five members of the Florida tourist guide changed the city to road No. 17, which leads through the often mixed centre of Florida, into the stage of black history and human drama.
With a large drum in life and in literature, Hurston led readers into the shop of Joe Clark's first Eatonville old age, and then turned to more personal places.
"The left side of the road," she wrote, "is a white piece of modern national school with well-maintained halls and playgrounds, which Howard Miller is always old, even though he can't read too much."
She also mentioned the new widow of Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and everything that fits into the hourly hotel."
So only a few hundred words linked Hurston Eatonville to self-government, but also with indignity, reinvigoration and sex.
This obviously wasn't typical of Fodor's loading.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says ninety-nine-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang simple songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
In Hurston, she still remembers herself as a chipper, who often returned after her family moved to Florida's Jacksonville.
Augustus Franklin, 70 years old, recalls that most of the time when she arrived in the city, she arrived without a report in the magnificent Chevrolet, smoked and wore pants in the city, which today is proud of clothes.
Most of the people were fascinated, said Franklin, but a lot of them were fighting.
"The people of Zora always liked to see," said Franklin.
But, added, he likes the chair on the back terrace with a view to the lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were cut out of the press.
It seemed that Eatonville had forgotten the rest of the world together.
Although she was once a literary star, contemporary Langstone Hughes and the only black man at Barnard College in the 20th century, she was buried in an unmarked tomb in the Florida Fort Pierce, where she lived before.
In Eatonville, there were no bigger sadistic rituals or big public readings.
"I don't think they understood her significance for the world, nor her reference," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's "Wrapped in Rainbows (Packed in Ghosts)" in 2003.
The change came in the '80s.
Representatives of the Orange County period wanted to extend the city's five-way highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-way main road.
Orlanda's landing has already pushed through State Road No. 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still getting from a complicated historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950 ’ s, the struggle to blend the race brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a party of white guys, they came and threw oranges and things on the people who sat on the side," said Franklin.
"We actually had one lady who killed it.
They walked out of the car melon."
In a letter from The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston questioned the requirement of the highest court for forced integration and his decision in the Brown case against the education chamber stated that "it is more offensive to my race than celebrating."
Citizens now claim that the disaggregation of schools, although positive in some areas, has reduced the coherence in Eatonville and undermined the courage of today’s youth.
"Black children were used to hug - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the Preserve the Eatonville Community (Save Eatonville Community).
It lasted until the teachers and students came from the same place, added.
"You don't embrace your white teacher, because your white teacher - I mean there's a cultural barrier," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, civil law has helped to create space for many other Zory Neale Hurston - black writers, artists and artists who, like her, have raised themselves above prejudices with lyconomic self-esteem and quotes such as "How can someone resist my pleasure?
I don't get it."
In 1975, Alice Walker arrived at Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight for her reputation.
Five years later, Hurston’s famous biographer Robert E. Hemenway came to the police in the bookstores and reorganized her into the American cannon.
The project with the highway arrived just when the most famous daughter of Eatonville again found a light ramp.
The former neighbor of Hurston now considered her a savior.
In 1988, the community began to plan the Hurston Festival to show what could become of destruction.
Thousands of fans arrived at the opening event two years later, and each ice is returned to the celebration.
A few years later, the state stopped from the road proposal.
"These five flows of the highway have risen, you would say it has gone straight away, truly civil pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd said it easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
Winning over the road project has helped change the image of the city.
Other places like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to attend the present church in 1993, began to appear in larger numbers, and the people began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-father library (of course named after Hurston) was opened in 2006 with Kennedy Boulevard being re-opened and decorated.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from the center of Orlanda can sometimes act as a western street in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(90 percent black today.)
With other people who come looking for the story and the importance of Eatonville, it is still often treated with caution.
Permission for most of the talks is necessary to have something ahead and certain things - like wall paintings in the oldest eatonville church that paint whites and show blacks on the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a courageous, self-relianced teacher who likes the Red Network, are still afraid that their isolated community will not be correctly understood.
And even as Hurston's festival grew, domestic pride also increased.
In particular, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw the whole race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse and as proud, creative, industrious, funny and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
From the voice of Franklin's son, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, he is singing a sincere love for the community when he plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in the local government or the police who says he's going to enjoy some help.
And even younger ones, such as eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonova, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just go through here, will think, 'Hm, this city is nothing against the others,' said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after church.
"But if you really stop and look for a moment in history, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we're all talking financial gas.
At first glance, nothing changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from news stations and huge TV shows at Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were standing in the middle of the storm.
They would never have decided that in the brigade hole, offices over their heads have every day bankers and managers of investment funds that monopolies New York, the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
Shippers keep counting metal vehicles by the wayside and transmit muffin lighters to the breakfast meeting.
The Hispanics are still moving between the towers and carrying, like human mules, fifty of the prized shirts hanging from the trousers on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in front of their early bagel at the street dining stations, and it is still not possible to get on the day of the yellow taxi between fourth and seventh afternoon.
It didn't look like a crisis at all until, with all the talk about the song, I decided to set up a burning account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I was doing this job so that he could cover up with a late afternoon set at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, there were about 20 people waiting on the front.
Not in front of the store windows to pick up or store cash, but in front of the shift, where older customers order check books, tourists ask for a way to trade with mixed Macy's goods and new customers book accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker", came for the same reason as me.
However, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They chose money from so-called triffs (a little similar to construction spongiforms), cash companies and types of spongiforms whose branches operate only in one state and who claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks were silent.
A few days ago Washington Mutual, a bank with assets for $327 billion, went to the contest, and when New Yorkers returned home on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with assets for $440 billion, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
Employees of offices and businesses, who stood before me and feared another collapse, moved their cash to a bank, which is perceived as a safe port and which makes most of the savings on Wall Street.
In the last week, the ordinary New Yorkers learned gas from the financial system.
Some woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the healing bank, and to her poor senior executive, Dick Fuld, with such a family background as if she was talking about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed approximately 50-year-old home of my cousin, has changed the subject of our regular conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food donation.
After my visit to the bank, she said, "I now have my savings in the money market.
I moved it, I won't risk it."
Muslim graveyards ravaged by the Austrian Right Crime
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian side of the Freedoms and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian side of the right Vlaams Belang, will participate in the event that presented in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 the organization "Citys Against Islamization".
They are similar to the transport marks that show the mixtures crossed by the red line.
The police accuse the right-wing extremists of exorcising the Muslim cemetery in Austria for the same weekend, in which the right-wing parties have achieved huge profits in general elections.
Over 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linze was once between Friday evening and this morning it was hard to destroy and the police are convinced it was an organized action.
The guilty insisted on some graves of Jewish symbols such as David’s star, but the detectives are convinced that it could be an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It's not clear if this incident was connected to the elections.
The speaker from the Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" with reports of defamation coming at the time of the end of the Muslim post month Ramadan.
In the meantime, Austria enters the search engine of its own soul after transport has collapsed in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both parties, who had received more than 30 per cent of the votes, the Freedoms and the Swaz for the future of Austria, carried out a campaign against immigration and some of their slogans were criticized as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the Free People's Party, who won over 18 percent of the vote, protested in the campaign against gossip and gossip, and even expressed his opposition to the food in which the relationship to Islam is perceived.
At the last meeting with the voter in Vienna, he spoke of the "European Brotherhood", which should prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mixtures and minerals and argue that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Research and analysis carried out immediately after the elections that set the extreme right to the most powerful political bloc in the country indicate that this change was caused primarily by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter doesn't have to travel abroad
Gary Glitter, a glamorous star who was convicted of sexual abuse of children, banned the court from travelling to France and Spain.
The officials made this six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the monitoring authorities that he was planning to travel across France to Spain.
The Kent police had this ban on the expulsion of children last Thursday, after giving the officials evidence of past Glitter judgments for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, on his own name Paul Gadd, did not attend Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
The Judicial Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September, at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the Kentucky police asked for a regulation that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd didn't personally participate."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, how he kept a record of sexual attackers.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
It must also transmit the scheduled date of police departure a week ago.
If the obligation to inform the authorities had been mentioned, it could be sentenced to five years.
The Kent Police announced that they would not discuss the individual cases of Glitter's possible journeys after the period.
The Kent Police spoke: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to track someone who stays in Britain because we have extensive systems that deal with potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting Kent's citizens is the highest priority for the Kent Police and we are working hard to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual attackers so as to reduce any danger to the public to the minimum."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls at the age of 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he had to fly to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities didn't let him pass a passport check and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials continued his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at the Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there, while his legal representative David Corker went to the Uxbridgian lowest criminal court in Western London and at the same time successfully requested Scotland Yard to register as a sexual attacker.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for the ownership of child pornography for four months.
The source of the interior ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the interior ministry, is peaceful and happy that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To catch the real character, I photograph the master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No shoes, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenca, rejected from focusing on interpretation - I only aim at the relaxed expression of men or women.
On the one hand, the artist.
Second, man.
Unsolved, if we forget private, in those moments far away from the audience - then you can see a reliable gesture, a deep-fighted look or passionate hand gestigulation, which are no-old, because they are not going to go on stage.
German Günther Bauer is running the theater of the "Flemenco-people" performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less-known face of the masters.
For this purpose, the photographer consists of a unique iconography of flamenco from different environments.
The exhibition, which takes place under the Month of Flamenca photography (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "represents the still growing international importance of flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flemenco-people" "can be any person, but when you look at the photograph, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on stage.
These people's portraits "on the street" are artists able to carry on stage passion, sadness, joy... and completely capture the spectators.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to photograph the scene.
He's wearing his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamens.
The famous festival "Cante de las Minas" began Bauer in 1997 a long way to portray flamency singers, guitarists and dancers on a disc camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical basis of the image and stimulates the current spirit, which is the idea that Bauer himself shows and the flamenco: "The mood with very traditional roots, but it does not stop to surprise and develop."
What the spectators are concerned about is not the effect of the dancing, singing, or playing, but the personality and character of the artist.
Looking for the moment when we meet with the most important, with that spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and living, it was and is a constant work presented during these days in the El Fotomat Gallery.
This selection of almost seventy photographers creates famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyosová, Enrique Morete, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project became like a flamenca anthology and soon there is a book edition that will contain exposed portraits.
The behavior for portraits led Bauer to the idea to repeat the idea of "SportARTProject" on "Portrets of Sports Veterans".
Although their concept is different from "Flemenco-people", the photographer admits that "to take pictures of people, recognize them and have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just short, to enter their lives - it's my passion.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in the photograph.
A person meets or interacts with people, personalities he never even knows, or gives him just a few minutes to take a picture.
Despite a similar situation, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
A collection of portraits of the current flamenco called "Flemenco-people" is shown in Galeria El Fotómata in street de la Mata 20, equivalent to Alamedo de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel that writes is "truffle"
He is playing in an environment that he does not yet know, and reports on events for his strangers, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully carry out his new project - he is working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for 20 years in Congo and traveled to Amazon.
The eternal favorite of Nobel Prize for Literature yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia festival admitted that the project that employs him is "troufality", and that "everything suggests that I shouldn't write" this novel.
"If I could understand, I wouldn't do it, but I'll do it and believe I'll finish it once," he made up his contribution to the Festival of Exchange of Ideas, Thoughts and Words, which he watched in the city for four days around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the Roman "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the celebration of the word and fulfilled the expectation.
Vargas Llosa, who won the price of the Hay Festival for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend", filled the theater Juan Bravo in the last place.
With Félix Rome, who introduced him, he had before him a dedicated audience who had spent an hour of time running like water - Perunec with remarkable precision and a remarkable dose of humor, remembered in him how from the original "incredulous adventure" of the "enjoyment of our reader" and of the "power to live more than I have lived" gave birth to the literary mission; how he subjected "a lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplinedly", carefully arranging the text, correcting and rewriting; or how his writings were influenced by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas and what "remind images" are the basis of his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" how to find out if and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just a fun, rainy experience" - stressed Vargas Llos by saying that he "is acting on people" and "the need is to try to forgive themselves from the ranks", and urged writers to "do not subject themselves to freedom" and "to take responsibility" of their mission.
Because of climate loss of fame in Pozoblanc - missing cups
The performance with the cups that closes the celebration in Pozoblanc was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement of the effective that the surface of the site is not in good condition.
Therefore, the company, together with Fermín Bohórquez, Pable Hermos de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to abolish the race.
Unfavourable weather conditions make this celebration difficult for a long time, two of the three festivals could not be accomplished.
On Saturday, the rains made it impossible for the course of the other planned bullfights.
During their formation, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to build bullies in the arena on Castilblanc.
But that's how it was only Friday.
The winner became Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and was rewarded for a dynamic and aesthetically high performance on his shoulder.
On the same day of the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante changed two mornings with cups for greetings and one ear that brought him more uncovered seats in the arena than toreadoric art.
Even worse, El Juli, who went through the race arena of Los Llanos, was unbearable.
In the second round of the drain without a single breath, the majority of the obstetrics were critical.
They took control in Álawa in a delivery of two thousand kilograms of hash
In ten minutes, five.
Road control of Ertzaintza in the urban district of Arminíón (Alava).
The members stop two people driving in the supplier and you drive them.
The charge, more than two tons of hash, is not to be stopped.
According to the report of the Committee of the Interior of the Basque Government, the members of the Committee followed and detained one of the persons driving in the supplier, men 38 years old, who was identified as A. A. J.
The detainee was accused of drug trafficking and of falsification of state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road checks at N-1 in places where the border of the city district of Arminón is passing.
They were going to stop the delivery for control, but the driver didn't listen to the instructions, got fast and caught.
The car’s occupants began to climb right away when the vehicle stopped at the edge a few miles further, at that time both passengers jumped up and fled to the forest.
At the end of one of them, Ertzaintzy’s followers took 2 178 kg of hashi, who suspected that they were carrying out a visit to Iveco Daily’s brand.
The latter part of the vehicle was loaded with hash packages, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug assessment.
In addition, the police found that the badge was "scattered" and did not agree with the data contained in the supply documents, therefore the defendant was also accused of falsifying the State documents.
Ertza continues to search for a second suspect, who, as mentioned above, managed to escape to finally determine the origin of the drug.
The detained A. A. J., 28 years old, was transferred to the police department to arrange the appropriate formalities before joining the next investigation.
Herečka Heather Locklear is detained for driving under the influence of drugs
Herečka Heather Locklear, a favorite Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was detained this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers when she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, reported the magazine People Talking California Road Watch.
The witness explained that around 4:30 p.m. Locklear's "passing on gas, driving ahead and back for sound drilling and trying to get out of the parking lot - several times passing the sunglasses".
A witness who first didn't know an actress, she saw Locklear a moment after she stopped at a nearby road and came out of the vehicle.
This person also warned the rescue service, because "she was afraid of Lockler's life."
When a police guard arrived at the scene, she found an actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the vehicle.
"She was disoriented," and therefore she was taken to a specialized drug and alcohol center to test.
According to the police spokesman, the actress cooperated and an excessive amount of alcohol was excluded, but "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medications, which was the first look for the guards."
Locklear was detained for suspicion of the effects of more than one non-specified substance and was arrested around 19:00, although she was released for freedom within hours.
Two months ago Lockler returned from the treatment clinic, where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists on the Andalusian IU Association to exercise its powers in the cause of Silva
The Head of the IU and the Member of the United Left of Gaspar Llamazares today announced that the final decision in the case of the former Advisory Committee on Youth and Sport at Seville Franciscan Manuel Silvy, who retired from the office last week after being accused of dealing in favour of his family, will depend on the country association of the party.
"I am too federalist, it is on the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares pointed out, to which the party will have to move in relation to the former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the Head of the IU insisted that in the case of the investigation of the illegal conduct permitted by Silva, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "IU was always fighting to ensure that such matters were as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict ethical code for all public functions".
'Sangre de mayo', Epic bet of Garcia
José Luis Garci in the film "The Flower's Blood" (Sangre de Mayo), inspired by the episode of the national past of Benita Pérez Galdose, relives the famous rise of the Spaniards against the French - it is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "explain the statement of the character and analysis of society", which he always admired as part of a famous novelist, explained today with Quim Gutiérrez and Paul Echevarría during the presentation of the image before a large team of interpreters.
The flower blood with metraces over two and a half hours will be placed in the cinema this Friday and in the future more than a four-hour TV series for Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of the literary creation of Galdose José Luis Garci, he claims to have fulfilled his "child's dream" by filming this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who, three years ago, entrusted him with filming at the Madrid Autonomous Province on 2 May, he accepted the offer that he would eventually come from the National History Episode.
The budget of 15 million, to which the Madrid province has fully contributed, means for Garci's "unique opportunity" to create an environment with bullets and costumes corresponding to the image of "the shaking of Spain, which was mistaken in the leadership for which it was going to fight - the struggle for independence led to the fall of the government of Ferdinand VII and the rest of the country," he stated.
The director, however, regrets that he could not count with the financial support that he received from the films The sad wing (Ala sad) or Goy's ghosts - almost double the Flower's blood - could not draw some scenes from the script signed at the same time by Horace Valcarcel, with which he works almost throughout his film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empesar) works as he is usually used to - on the scene with the actors he usually tries before the film and does not choose the cast because it seems to him to be "degrading" and he also believes that "part of the director's call is to go to theatres and movies and find out what's going on in the craft he's doing".
Many of the players he chose for the blood of May are already appearing in front of his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranag or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, with four nominations to Oscar, from which he received one, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the only Flower Blood, the Seven French Billar Tables and the last chosen Blind Sunshine, represents not a young generation of Spanish film scenes, but argues that "it will only appear".
Garci's not expecting any credit for this film.
"At first you think you're working for what's next, but then you realize that you're only working for the benefit, and then you're going to pretend to make another movie," Garci explains with more than 30 years of director's career.
Isabel Bayón relives the spiritual link of Sevilla dancer Tortoly Valencia
Sevilla dancer Flamenca gives hold to other Sevilla dancers.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of the father of Florence Tórtola Ferrer, and the mother of Andalusanky (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana's quarter, and when she was three years old, they moved with her family to London.
She danced a modern dance and focused on an Oriental dance.
She lived a life full of passion, was the proponent of women's emancipation such as Isador Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and was fighting for the abolition of a corset that made it impossible for women to move freely.
This woman's life influenced the dance and aesthetic revolution of the inter-war Europe Isabele Bayonová.
"I wanted to work with Pepo Gamboa, and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, it's not about telling her life, it's about grasping the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the flamenco rhythm.
So my "motel dance" was evocating a guayaira or "gada dance" some kind of tanga.
Her dance was funny and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic is also appropriate," she says.
The show is composed of two exceptional personalities: with Miguel Poved, who will sing in one performance as in the "Open Doors" (La porta openta), and with the teacher of the dance Matilde Coralova, who made an exception and joined in cooperation with her former cook.
"Matilde represents an older Tortola, a mature character.
I'm glad she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it's a great honor for me."
It also includes the music and guitars of Jesse Torrese and Paca Ariagy, with the singing of Miguel Ortegy, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájara, the violin of Rafa El Violy and the co-operation of the artist Juanfry Juárez, who "has the role of the eternal guide of this kind of artist, who are primadons with everything, and who are always in love with them".
The part also takes into account the life of this woman, who has been playing for her time in places such as India, the United States or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, because she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her, because I think she was one of those women who at some time had a huge influence, but nobody knows her today and then less appreciates her creation," says Bayon.
The show starts today at 20.30 in Lope de Vegy.
The book "Wonderful of Christmas" also closes the trienals
The introduction of the first illustrative edition of the "Denique of Christmas Married" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez closed his marriage with Zenobija in March 1916, is part of the programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Andalusian Government at the celebration of "Trinale Zenobie and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the fiftyth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the Year of Their Death.
"Triumnals of Zenobie and Juan Ramón" is about to end with the new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel museum house and the travel exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Onen pepsek sun", which was opened in May of this year, and after lunching various Andalusian provinces, according to plans at the time of the congress, it should be moved to New York.
The Cultural Council of the Andalusian Autonomous Government also ordered eight sets of prints of the "Denique of Freshness of Married" by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue spreading the awareness of the personality and part of one of the world's most famous Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like himself so much anymore
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of the actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "without bad intentions" and, under the awareness that Newman left, reveals his unsatisfied vision of abandoned American cinematography and the whole of America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And that he's been in retirement since 2007.
And that he knew he was very ill.
Even so, he was for all the boys.
"Sometimes what a person feels can't express in any way, and I've now lost a great friend," said in tears Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to him."
No one was afraid he'd be ridiculous or overreacting.
The father of the film and the government died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when the American self-conscious is on the day when desperate people seek reasons for pride.
When time is harsh and people without dignity and only a handful of those who are worthy of your admiration - there is no need to be Luis Cernud to love Paul Newman.
For all, he was almost the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official supporter of Richard Nixon and the warrior for lost and saved cases, from the drug addiction donation based on honor of the firstborn son, who died of overdose, until after his own mark of domestic food and biofood.
A complete treasure for a country that has made a lot of effort to forgive itself from a self - sacrificing food culture.
The stormy wave flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not one man died, but one whole era.
Another Englishman, holding Oscar under the direction of Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was the top of his career.
Bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, troufled Newman to mark himself as his greatest source of inspiration.
"The fox has all put on a very high wing," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the little ones who today has the courage to try to live as Paul Newman - based on honesty and leads a serious private life far away from the camera.
It's not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes not even possible.
But fortunately such people are, and Paul Newman is their model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who was faithful, although she had more than enough opportunities.
"Why would I go out to the hamburger when I have a home filet?" I'd like to joke.
May he be proud in the heavens that the earth will be united between his daughters and admirers - it is not too common in America.
It is said that "for all the great roles that he performed, he was the most proud of the role of a devoted husband, loving father, a willing grandfather and a philanthropist."
Unperfect races of the Madrid Olympics
Yes, many of us long for the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after 2012 it may be 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we run a race yesterday, I say no!
It was about him as a perfect race, and according to my judgment, he was the worst I've ever been on.
Such a dream of mindlessness, that as soon as it comes to the evaluation and I'm trying, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, pretty one after the other.
Idiots begin by picking up a race number, which is why you have to get out early.
I don't think it's bad, but when a man goes there, they give him everything (including a chip to avoid overloading the track).
Oh, no.
Here man had to pick up the number first (first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after the related front) - what a surprise! - they only had a S-size trick (second nonsense, because I need the XL size).
Where do we live?
That's because of the crisis they decided to buy just a little shirt because it's less substances and they're cheaper?
All right, well, that's a little compared to what was done on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it had to go very soon for the chip and the front of it lasted over 15 minutes, he had to give up the bag.
The waiting period lasted over 35 minutes, which is at a race where 11,000 people are expected to be unintelligible.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't put up with the bats yet, and when it happened, it was much worse picking up.
The waiting also lasted 40 minutes of rain, leading to a general riot and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have to go through tomorrow and some of us, like me, will not see the right time to evaluate the results of the chip that they gave me and which, I suppose, didn't notice the right time to start.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, I wouldn't think of this.
And so I think we're going to have to make sure that we're going to have a well-prepared Olympic town.
Microsoft is looking for reception (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft launched further developments in the new image recognition system and human interaction in the way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the entire area of the company) and doing what he heard in the conversation.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognizes the shapes and faces, this "receptive" can determine how many people are in the room who - even remember what they have on themselves - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It can also classify the present according to the conversion groups.
In the demonstration video, the reception records a third person and understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
She's asking if she's going after someone, and she's telling her she's going to be committed in a moment.
That's all without the blue screen of death.
That's amazing.
But of course it's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week much has been said about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the most necessary, without the competition of commercial remains, they would be five times more efficient -- man, Steve, they would be cheaper.
Discover as a noise when we consider that Microsoft version adds a new function to Windows and another "extra".
Changing the direction would be an act of merit.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning and is similar to the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who joined the theory that it was the first step in Google to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary level for understanding between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to the fabric.
That's right.
It never disappears, but we need to think about the "death" of the operating system, not as absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, to more internet browsers.
The computer turns off to trigger Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time on the Internet than around windows.
What are half of the applications that run the system for?
There's less.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
Zoufale needs it, and here's a little example.
I took this photo in a rest room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the connecting machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, it confirmed the delay of a new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It won't come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count to 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone's becoming the next bit more computer.
Given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay for the delay of the expensive.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried him on the Azuro coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one shot at "The Blood Diamond" Edward Zwicka, as well as Al Pacino in "Kmotro" Francis Ford Coppoly, and is also part of the uniformly svalated gay community.
And if we want to be able to count his life roles, we can sink down to the image of a typical doll with a pointed doll that raises the crime in a cat's circus.
It's basically nothing more than a typical cottony pantyhose, tight and hand-free.
English speakers call him 'tank', but only Fabuleus Marcel from Brussels wins over all the others.
For the first time in his name -- even when people call him 'Marcel' -- which is related to sport, because, according to the legend, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above other quality cotton, unisex cutting, distinguishing with a label and (almost unknown) Belgian flag, which have models of the most unimblematic tiles as a detail at the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company is not specializing only on tank tops.
He also manufactures makeup colleges, retro boxers, cashmere sweats, cotton pants, seam shirts, clothes for children, mini shirts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
Her sister’s tremendous image did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, though small, is a woman full of life.
They're taking Cruz's sisters very seriously.
For Monica, it means a lot more than just that some nice, famous girls will lend their names.
In Paris, the promotion campaign organized by Mango in his new home was attended, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion prices sponsored by this Spanish company.
She's heartless and she's getting close to you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce the new collection that Sister Penélope proposed for Mango this summer season, and at the same time I participated in the announcement of the second annual "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner in Opera for Valentine's Day.
So it was a difficult but exciting day at the same time.
What's your new collection for Mango, for which you've been working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the '50s and '60s, and we've had a lot of excitement.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk dressed, combine and fold their clothes, I do it very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but in the end, everything is connected and has a lot of connections.
I must have liked the clothes, I still wanted to go to my grandmother's, talk in my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
It was a sensation, almost better than going on a walk.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my clothes.
But you know we dancers are relying on how we're adjusted to feel good at our own hours and tests in view of the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, you're really going to get into the character.
So everything is connected, of course with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You've just been 30, you've been hit by a crisis?
Oh, my God.
I'm feeling better than ever before, I'm enjoying my thirty.
I find the woman is already ready, she has experience and life enjoys less mistakes.
Biological hours don't scare me.
I do what I want, and it gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course I know I'm going to be a mother because my body wants it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss it.
As far as father is concerned, I'm not worried about it.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a sense of happiness and I will bring him up with great love.
As far as the film is concerned, there are now a couple of movie premieres you made last year.
It's like that, and I'm looking forward to them coming to the movies.
I'm from the theatre world, and so I'm very impatient and restless, and I want everything right now and then of course it's not going to work.
I look forward to the premiere "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the Tomba of Christ".
The way you like them...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the screening mill on Naomi Campbell's side, didn't you?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to stand on the floor like a model.
She only called me Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and invited me to London to take part in the benefit reviews for her "Woman for a Better Life" organization, and the clothes we were wearing - I selected two models from our collection for Mango - and the winning was handed over to this Naomi's non-governmental organization.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
She's talking about a lot of things, and I, since I know her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good thing he's getting involved in.
She asked me to play for charity, but if she asks me to make a stand, I'll do it too.
In the interests of the third world's women, I'll do whatever it takes.
Repeated arrival drivers with alcohol in the blood will have to install "alcohol"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative sanctions under the influence of alcohol must install in his vehicle a system that prevents him from starting a car in a state of drunkenness or if he does not hesitate.
The proposal has already been made known in June of this year and is now included in the Annual Report of the Supreme State Representative, which states that it will be a pilot project that will last one year.
His goal is to return the drivers to the steering wheel, so the drivers will also have to complete the overload course.
This experience will be shared by the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Office of the Technical Institute for Car Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 % of motorists charged more than once for alcohol treatment will be re-elected as a wheel in this state.
Alcohol should be prevented because it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the blown air and prohibits the start of the car if the driver is already inactive or if it is recorded higher than the permitted concentration of alcohol.
His price is over 1,000 euros and he'd have to pay it himself.
The study carried out in this sense in the USA in 2007 showed that in the first year of the introduction of vehicles equipped with this device, the offences were reduced by 65 %.
In Spain it is estimated that every year it could save 115 people.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to resolve this behaviour before it is committed in a criminal act.
And in order to help introduce it, since legal correction can be carried out in a normal way, the necessary correction of criminal provisions requires a change of law.
The equipment is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, even though some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles have already been tested.
Just tomorrow the Congress of Members will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), which recommends the installation of this system on school buses, as it is in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 17.40 a.m., as was the case in the program, he landed in the presidential hangar at Benita Juárez airport in Mexico City, D. F., an aircraft of Spanish air forces, where the prince and princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun had just come to light, but his paprika had to close their eyes so that the next couple coming out of the plane could be seen.
There was a Spanish ambassador and other officials under the umbrella.
A few hours ago, I asked the cab driver if he knew that the Spanish prince and the princess were coming to visit the state.
- Yeah, so that's great, it's not gonna get people to pick up at the airport... she's from here or something...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well...
However, the Mexican press well knows who the prince and princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport close to the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 marine soldiers prepared to shoot an honorary rescue.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a suit of dark blue color and princess, very neatly dressed and with discolored hair, he does not have his usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that in D. F. he threatens the storm.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and they are not forced to delay them.
At the door of the hotel, where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican TV reporter is waiting for them.
Best delivered fashion price
There's probably no better place in the world to declare fashion prices than Paris and there's probably no more significant designers and bonvivans than Valentino.
Mango has just issued the second annual El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow the international presentation of new talent in fashion.
The price is EUR 300,000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoliová, winner of the first year, last night, looked at his proposals in Manga's exhibition at the Paris bubble Haussmann number 54 and almost cried with touch.
Of course, it is the second largest business of this company in Europe and has just been opened on a total of 1,335 square meters.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank the designer Valentina for taking over the presidency of the competition jury, led us to finally have an overdraft dinner in the Parisian Opera Garnier.
Mango's famously decorated Presidential Table appeared next to the most significant Chagall works even more wonderful.
Naty, who was heartbroken because of her brother’s recent death, did not show up, wore the clothes of this badge and the jewelry of ELAH, over which the breath was poured, and hung in his son Luise - almost two-metre elegane - accompanied Valentina in the front of the table at dinner to his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took a welcome and, as a real gentleman, stayed with Baroness Rothschild without a bag, because they both offered them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - own-designated - pants and shirts and turned into long black dresses for dinner, took a night walk after the opera along Goyi Toledova, showed us the ballet exam room, and at other times she caught one of the pitches and marked the "grand floor".
Inés Sastre's house didn't stop after the side buildings, but she showed us her son's pictures on the phone before leaving.
The second morning we were able to love the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man who rides on a motorbike - and John Travolty, who came to the Paris Intercontinental hotel with his own clothes and towels and first asked not to use any fragrance in his rooms.
The stars under the starry Paris sky.
Oh, there's life.
1001 - Stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and mad everyday life.
And in order not to be too short, all are summed up in one book that will lead to the bookstore relax on September 30th.
The alarm is ringing every morning at 7 o'clock as a punishment, but even worse it is to imagine yourself trapped in a successful rhythm that brings the present life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the disease of the 21st century.
However, there are no one or two ways to fight daily exhausting and problems to get rid of the world of work.
No, that number is nothing bigger and nothing less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, outside the yoga position, classical massages and "spa" therapy on her books, gathered all the "menu" options adjusted according to the taste and time options of each individual.
The book of protest is called "the 1001 way of relaxation" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and the DK will bring peace to the bookstore.
If anyone thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, "handbook" rejects this view.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you don't get adrenaline in your veins, which re-balances in your body, and stress becomes a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Sleeping Speech
Some kids talk at night.
I don't think those who wake up and the kids tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they sleep.
When it happens first, it may cure you, but it's actually insignificant.
It's a harmless sleep disorder called somniloquie.
It's quite common, especially for children and young people.
Of course, one of you was told that he was talking about sleeping at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadic (e.g. once a lifetime in high fevers), or with more regularity (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the second day the child does not remember anything.
There's not only one reason to explain her performance.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night rage, night enuresis (night care) or monthly, but it doesn't have to be that way.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stress, or anxiety.
In any case, it's a bit of a tricky phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (screaming, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where it appears with great strength, it would be appropriate to observe and consult with the expert to see if there is any problem that causes him great anxiety, and this is the way it occurs.
We said that it is a non-injurious disorder, therefore it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g. if it is eaten with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a number of very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to upset the child too much before he goes to bed.
So watch peaceful games and avoid violent or violent TV programs or shows.
In very nervous children and those who give work to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques to help them gain some inner peace.
The child will make it easier to sleep.
When a somniloquie appears, try to remain calm.
Remember, she's harmless to the child, and she won't remember anything about what she did the other day.
Useful tips
Don't be him.
It's unnecessary because he's not aware and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and then he rests.
Keep in mind that if you feel that you are suffering a number of times, it would be good to seek advice or find out what causes such anxiety in your child.
If you understand what he says (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to listen to him and draw information from him.
It won't do anything, because when he sleeps, he's not aware of how he can get his thoughts.
Besides, you can hear what he says, but you don't know what he thinks, and then why he says it, so be careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you're reaching.
Never tell your child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not for fun.
That's causing a lot of anxiety.
Don't worry about it, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that takes just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory again after a long sleepy period.
Without having a big game in particular, the jaundices created more chances and managed to change one of them successfully.
The game did not have too fast a pace during this shooting, in which attackers were hard to reach.
After the first attempt by the captain of Kauffmann's host, who was shot from a distance just about the hair of the previous associate, began to have Illhaeusern light surface and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain on a long foot or also Diebold gradually came to the defense of Dannemarie.
On the contrary, the opponent built a defensive wave in the middle of the game and left only agile Riahhi at the edge of the attack.
The beginning of the second half turned out to be decisive, and first thanks to the two odds Dannemarie named Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeuesern, which he took care of, well located for the processing of the ball reflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53').
However, Golman Illhaeuserna did not enjoy his joy for a long time, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the closet and leave his associates so weakened.
Dannemarie, however, failed to cope with the 11th of Illhaeusern, who was just a little tired of "screaming" the defense, no longer causing any major difficulties, with the exception of the very last seconds of the battle, when the ball had flown very close to the edge of the March after a great confusion.
Sarkozy's going to blow up angry fishermen.
Before leaving the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a ride across Britain.
To face the demonstration of the forces of fishermen who broke the access of several British and Nordic ports on Monday, the French President decided to go to the Guilvinec port in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The last nominations promised to accept "in a constructive spirit", and hope that "he will come with concrete proposals".
The President's visit comes at the same time as the "crisis committee"'s annual meeting of British fishermen to take action against a sharp increase in oil prices, which reached the peak of an average of 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the spokesman of the Elyse Palace David Martinon, the president "will talk about solutions that can be presented in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better ensure the conditions of employment and payment of seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to fish with insufficiency.
On Tuesday morning, they performed the operation of the "leaf" (transactions of slowly driving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing a 10km delay.
The recreational port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections towards Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filter override was carried out on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors demonstrated their determination already Monday, when immediately before the loading of the cargo of ports in Brest and Lorient, they burned tyres and pallets while in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc held demonstrations.
The movement was extended to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the La Manche Canal, as to Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the shipyards remained in the port, or to Le Havru, where about 20 vessels blocked the operation of commercial ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area during the evening stopped the blockade of important refineries Total in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decide to act themselves until the mid-term meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "crisis committee" will decide on how to proceed on the way, and on its participation in the preparatory meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the State Fisheries Committee who did not support their movements.
"The situation will continue" because "fishers will not leave anything" and "do not want to go to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee in Lorient.
Fishermen from a call who do not pay oil tax are currently about 50 cents per litre, however, it is considered that the ship’s efficiency threshold is achieved only when it is below 0,30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Great
The unforgettable representative of Butche Cassidy and Kida died as a result of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes also gave their thanks to the legend of a film and a politically committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery requirements for 2008
This year, Brazil's aircraft manufacturer relies on the delivery of 215 aircraft, despite the threat of a recession that is rising above the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, maintains his requirements for 2008 with 215 devices added, confirmed his president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian builder promises a great deal from the Chinese market, especially has its 30 to 120 seats in the skyline of its aircraft.
To this day Embraer has added 41 devices to Chinese customers within eight years.
AIG takes into account the turnover of 15 % of its assets
The insurer of the American International Group, whose American money offices have been given over water, thinks that he would spend more than 15% of his assets to pay 85 billion dollars that he was given as a deposit, writes the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to examine the sale of most of its activities outside of life insurance in the international field and income activities in the United States, clarifying a diary that quotes resources close to ongoing negotiations.
According to FT, the AIG Governing Council met on Sunday evening to examine possible behaviour.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory declaration from the AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to dispose of include its International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the insurance insurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of properties and investments in private equity, is delivered by FT.
No final decisions on these procedures have been taken so far, FT continues.
The AIG must quickly obtain cash so that it can pay the 85 billion loan that the Federal Reserve Bank has given him, at the risk that the US authorities will have 80 % of the capital, while also settling the shareholding ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historic meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historical decline on Monday after the November representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the bank: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, which is invisible loss approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
The largest current point-down in its history (about 684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the renewal of the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index with the dominant technological component lost, according to definitive data after the end of the trade, 199,61 points and was set at 1,983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1, 106,55 points.
From the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street literally failed after an unexpected rejection of the plan to save the Bank of Sweden representatives, a plan that should allow a little stability to be found on the markets again.
228 votes against and 205 for representatives refused to provide the Secretary of State with the funds he requested.
Two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees that Congress is unable to adopt a plan," Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial thinks.
"It shows how much the market depended on this plan," she added and expressed concerns that the project adopted in a few days did not come "too late".
"If this project is indeed condemned to bankruptcy (...), the staff will be immediately handed over to Fed (the American Central Bank, no. reg.) and to other central banks to exacerbate the crisis, which would further satisfy the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, the head of the Global Insight economy.
And with emphasis on the urgency of the situation in the United States, Piegza has argued that "every new day brings down one financial institution".
After Friday's crash, Washington Mutual organized the bank's bank's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly turned around and called for prompt intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets are not "only in the US crisis, but in the world crisis", an analyst from FTN Financial added.
The bond market has gone down a lot.
The yield from the 10-year stock exchange decreased by 3,632 % on Friday night, by 3,827 % on Friday night, by 30 years at 4,161 % on 4,357 % on the previous day.
Obama won points on the first television duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House, the second debate followed, with the task of finding out which of the two John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The leading states of the Republicans and Democrats campaign were not surprised when both declared their victory on television duel, which followed a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent, was not "brilant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential elections, a decrease in research.
The Gallup Constitution, whose public opinion study published on Saturday, grants Obama a five-point advance (49% versus 44% for McCain), considers that the Democrats are the winner of the duel.
Among the undecided voters that are just concerned, Obama is the winner of 39% of the respondents, while, according to the CBS survey, 25% of the winner is attributed to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time the only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's given up," said Bill Clinton on the weekend.
Seventy-one McCain has consistently raised his irrevocable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "nature" of his opponent on the issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
"It seems that Senator Obama didn't understand that..." was a repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president," he said.
In such an aggressive spirit, the Republican television broadcasts took place yesterday.
Obama stressed the future.
He didn't lose his head, and he turned out to be a careful and precise guy.
He expressed his ability to make the right decision and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still did not understand, while Obama did," he said about the weekend's democratic meeting, which the Republicans assumes does not sufficiently take into account the impact of the crisis on the "common American".
"During the 90-minute debate of this John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday before 20,000 people gathered at the pre-election meeting in North Carolina for rain.
He did not even say words like "middle class" or "workers". The financial breakdown clearly benefits Obama, whom Americans consider to be more capable of saving the economy on the edge of the disaster.
"Next week, a decisive return could occur," the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's "economic proselytism" to what Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For the candidate of the Democrats, the current threat is "the ultimate verdict of eight-year-old poor economic policy, as George Bush conducted and supported it, Senator McCain".
The Senator of Illinois once again confirmed that through unexpected jumps to Wall Street, he should be able to reduce the tax of 95% of Americans, and also noted that the realization of the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is its priority number one, together with the introduction of the health insurance system.
McCain plans again to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates have carefully avoided questions regarding the financial assistance plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which the Congress adopted last night and which is highly unpopular.
"What, did you notice that there were any elections in Minsk?"
Young people and regime opponents demonstrated Sunday night at the main square of the Belarusian capital to deny the results of the parliamentary elections.
Several hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday evenings following the closing of the polling stations in the main square in Minsk to protest against the irregularity of the elections to parliament.
Although no results have been announced so far, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, demise".
Some admit that they didn't even say to the election, "What would it be like if they did what they wanted to do with my voice," says one young man.
He does not believe that this regime, which has been in favour of foreign observers with a view to revitalizing the European Union, would be prepared to turn towards democracy.
Penalties, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian sexes and the freezing of certain assets, could be abolished if the observers were considered clean.
That's not what the opposition says.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers should not participate in the counting of votes," Juri Potémkin, spokesperson of the Union of Democratic Forces, of the various 12-party groupings.
"This is a cosmetic change," stressed Alexandr Milinkievič, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and the leading personality of the pro-European movement, "because it is essential that we count the votes, and we have the power to do so.
If some opposition MPs get to parliament, they will be appointed and never elected.
However, their entry into parliament can mean space on TV, meetings in regions and proposals for laws."
The opposition is therefore obliged to participate in political action, because "a dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
Since our economy, which is deeply indebted to Russia, is going to be a crisis and we are not reforming, it threatens us to become a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the course of the elections, does not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that participation appears to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of the vote in Minsk) has opened the way with all possible manipulations.
"What, did you notice that there were any elections?" asked Social-Democratic Leader Alexandr Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no foot in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are most eligible for the regime."
The night's silence again faded from the October square.
On TV, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commissions are blessing their success.
Discussion - Blood, which is still certain
Hema-Quebec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the establishment and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly pleased because Hema-Quebec became one of the most reliable and inefficient blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained the trust of the public, who was seriously disturbed after a scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is commonly known, the State Blood Reserve administered by the Committee for the Transfusion of the Red Cross was contaminated during the 1980s with an immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a C-type hepatitis virus.
In view of this drama and the wave of unrest, the Canadian government launched a public investigation in February 1994, which was chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which was intended to explain the circumstances leading to such a tragedy, and to make recommendations so that such a funeral could no longer be resumed.
While Judge Krever has left the report, some provinces have set up a committee to plan a new system of blood management in Canada.
In Quebec, the Géline's committee was set up.
According to the report of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec, which was to host Quebec, and the Canadian blood company for the storage of all provinces and both territories.
"When Hema-Québec began its activities in 1998, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system," Dr. Décary recalls.
"The situation was exciting.
In a systematic effort to increase the safety of blood products and the continued work in this area over the next years, we have regained public confidence," he says and proudly adds that in early 2008 Hema-Québec has already believed 94% of Quebec's population.
However, Dr. Decary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is very fragile."
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998 Hema-Québec has applied the principle of caution.
"At that time we witnessed in Europe the existence of many human cases of crazy cow disease, new variants of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," the woman, who has been leading the company since her founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread blood.
We therefore supported one of the basic recommendations of Krever and Gélineau's report, according to which, in the event that we do not know, and when serious disease is at stake, in this case, Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which marks the degeneration of the brain which inevitably leads to death, must be taken by an exclusive measure.
So in April 1999, we rejected blood from people who stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proved that this disease was transmitted to the blood.
So this episode showed us that keeping the principle of caution made sense."
In 1999 a much more accurate HIV detection technique appeared on the market: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) that enable the presence of the virus itself directly in donor blood, rather than the presence of antibodies on which tests were used previously were used.
NAT tests have allowed for a short period of noise between the patient's infection and the moment our blood technology can be detected, explains the specialist.
We've been able to shorten this period for less than a week.
We have actually reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing about it and without being able to do so.
This improvement made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusion.
The risk of getting blood contaminated with HIV is one out of 12 million today.
"In other words, it means that before someone gets HIV, he will have to distribute 12 million blood products.
In view of this, Hema-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products every year, it will take 24 years before the first case of transmission of HIV through the blood product appears.
I believe that today we can obtain or prescribe a blood transfusion that is necessary for healing," says Hema-Québec's head of management.
"The challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen may appear in the system.
Just last year, a Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like a West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by biting the tissue.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary, stressing that, in addition to safe storage, Hema-Québec must also be counted with sufficient storage.
"They need to grow, because the population will grow old.
As a result of more aggressive treatment of cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which averages only 3% of Quebecans eligible for donation."
Every healthy person at least 18 years of age who meets the eligibility criteria, but can donate blood only once in 56 days, that means six times a year.
14% of people with blood supply are not accepted on average because they are, for example, the carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they visited the country where the bathing colds are held, they are excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Weaknesses are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to supplement the extent to which they are old and are no longer able to donate blood.
But to convince people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so endless that we can only find an hour to be able to donate blood," Francine Décary will get.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart beats, eye bubbles and skin, which is used almost exclusively for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank from the Québec apocalyptic cord.
The apocryphal cord, previously considered biomedical waste, pours blood rich into stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"Several weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousands of blood samples from the apothecary to the bank and we assume that we will take them over a thousand years.
At the beginning of next year we should start offering them for transplants," explains Dr. Décary, who describes the program of blood collection from the apocalyptic cord as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they have no access to it," because Hema-Québec does not have enough means to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in semifinals
The impact of Montreal, yesterday at the Saputo Stadium during the second and at the same time the decision-making quarter-final match played on the total number of tracks qualified for the semi-final round of the first USL division, thanks to victory 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over the Sounders from Seattle.
The hostage Antonio Ribeiro gave the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the two-sided unbiased first half, the editors David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, the remaining two rounds of visual formation, were quoted.
Roger Levesque was the only one who was able to consult Matt Jordan for the sake of the Sounders.
Remember that during the first of the two quarter-finals, he suffered impact on Starfire Complex in Tukwile at the Battle of Seattle 2-1.
The impact will be measured in the semifinals of its power with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder settled in a home-run deficit 3:1 and finally won 4:3, however, Whitecaps went into a semifinal round with total score 5:4.
The impact should be addressed with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series of matches will be confirmed to this day.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
The first three Canadian attacks are ready to start the season.
The unit made up of Alex Kovalev, Tomáš Plekance and Andrej Kosticina last night at the Bell Centre prompted an attack on the victory of the Canadians 3:2 for solo rides.
Kosticin, the largest shooting star, shot the goal, the Plekanec gathered two assistances and Kovalev staged one performance in this fourth three-coloured win of the six preparatory matches.
Kovalev won by giving himself a single goal during the solo rides.
"I'm not ready yet," warned Russia.
"I need another fight to feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to manage too many," noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice smile."
Charest bets on the north
The Prime Minister shall not preclude the holding of preliminary elections by the end of the year
Immediately after the end of the Liberal Party (Party Liberal), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where in today's supplementary elections the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left).
"Descend between our last big northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visual way at the conclusion of the Conference of the Liberal Party of Québec in Lévis, but he did not tell the details.
During his speech, images were projected behind his back in a painting mill.
On three huge plates, a slide with remarkable images of hydroelectric fences, below, Quebec from the view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great resources, just like in the pre-election period.
At the press conference, the other Prime Minister refused to rule out that in the fall he would have called for early elections, even though he pointed out that he had a very busy programme.
"The North Plan" is the fourth dimension of "vise", intended by the Prime Minister for Quebec, a vision of "new economic space", which includes an agreement with France on labour force, an agreement between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario.
Although the opening of the North - northern territory at the 49th Equation - the Prime Minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "breathing with enormous potential", but did not specify the time, amount of investment, nor a clear priority in future projects.
At the top, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further broken down: in particular water plants, forests, especially the target sector, driven by rapid growth in developing countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
North, according to Charest's account, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "land twice the size of France is with us", "is in Quebec.
And he's not just with us, but he's in us," he stressed, as if he wanted to show that he's calling for a certain national foundation myth.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, the prime minister raised: gold chonba in Abitib, Québec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after he turned off the theater to look at a huge map behind his back.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes the part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, clarified the prime minister during the press conference.
"It is a traditional attitude that has been repeated by all the governments of the world.
There is one border line that no longer exists, and if an opportunity arises, on behalf of the government, this position will be taken again," he said.
Otherwise, "in relation to climate change, we also need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, when he spoke of a transition north-west, which will open every year as a result of the ice-cream.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking over the territory becomes an obligation.
And what about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former Beijing MP from Hungary), have already started negotiations with about thirty communities.
The action was initiated by the Interministerial Committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and has an important position by Julie Bouletová (Transport and Natural Resources).
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily summit", but a moment when "the common vision will be lifted".
The development of the North should continue in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "co-designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visit" as a gas station on the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the Liberals who have preceded us, we have changed our thinking to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was still one of the still overcrowded theme of the weekend, which was launched on Friday by a large cocktail raising Jean Lesage’s 50th anniversary in front of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to cross the Beauharnois Centre at the Adélard-Godbout override.
"From Godbout, which founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who carried out the Klidna revolution and nationwide water power, until after Borass, who created James' Bay, proved our party to create the future," Jean Charest said.
At the press conference, he turned to another authority, this time conservative, including the program "Roads to the North" John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
When a number came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydro power plant, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying it between us, but I'm planning to be at it," he said to his members' base, which caused a great deal of relief.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there will be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of holding elections in the autumn of this year, which enables him to do so.
However, he stressed that his program was busy, especially missioning the Federal Council in China and the Québec-New York Summit.
The weekend summit provided the leader of the Liberal platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "powers to change the constitution", which last very hard: PLQ (Liberal party of Quebec) requires particular recognition of the "specificities of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint part of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Television Council, who should have the right to veto in the event of decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the North Plan was adopted skeptically in its main realms.
Chief PQ (Party Québec) Pauline Marois re-evaluated the development policy in northern Quebec, which the Landry government left in 2001.
According to it, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it refused to implement this policy.
If she were to hold on, "we would go on today," Marois noted on the side of her candidates in Jean-Talon (where elections are taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But we accept that it is not just a theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, a leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - Disadvantaged Countries
He was Vic Toews, former minister of justice (on irony) in Harper's office, who allowed himself to say last summer about Louise Arbour that he was a "honba" for Canada.
So beat a woman who has led an inexhaustible struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration, it tells a lot about the Prime Minister's environment and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that, as the only one of all the participating Western countries, has not returned to the authority of its state member imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
The government, which does not at all consider that at the time of the act that was executed on it, Omar Khadr was a young teenager.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing a women's convention, is denying its word and letting it rot under the conditions of a child soldier.
The only one who relies on the parody of justice to judge the guilty.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and, in particular, the Association of Canadian Lawyers, are defending the repatriation of Omara Khadra so that there can be a fair trial in Canada.
The Tataz government closes its eyes before torture: she cares little about the fact that this young man has been psychologically destroyed in the first place, and it has undoubtedly lasted, after so many years of printing.
We don't realize it, but we're just witnesses of the narrow erosion of our rights, our freedoms and our "democracy", the words that Harper is so daring and that his mouth sounds so empty.
The time has come when there is no more morals: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, treat him badly, arrest him according to the libel of the chief until the minority government (as it will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation on the side that declares Righteousness, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made our country's reputation and seriousness.
Hanba is, Mr. Toewsi, in this denial, not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwell's speech by Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of the Canadian Labour Company Barrick Gold.
With Orwell's logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has begun to attract three authors and a poor little charge for insulting honors with the aim of calling for a "transparent public debate" and demanding six million.
If it's true that judges are independent and impartial, they don't judge truth, especially in the case of an insult to honor, but the law.
It's not surprising that Garver is completely wrong with this fundamental resolution.
Or is it perhaps for Barrick Gold the best way to conduct a public debate, bring to the field anyone who dares to take a wrong position?
Whatever the case may be, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend considerable sums in order to be prepared to fight and fight in a very unbalanced fight with the army of lawyers supported by almost useless labor companies.
The tactics in these unbalanced fears are often associated with the destruction of the accused in order to bring about a peaceful procedure that will shut the mouth of the opposite side and also frighten anyone who dares to commit this thing.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had her eyes on the whole thing to present to the public opinion.
In contrast to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold acts, in Canada there is a debate on normal circumstances in the exchange of ideas, rather than in the early stages of learning.
It was therefore not enough for the company to open its books, its documentation and conduct a real debate through the news, the media, the publication and the financing of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole thing.
Barrick Gold, however, seems to have no confidence in public opinion and is very reluctant to refuse petitiones and letters to support the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Maybe Garver could explain how he could demand "public debate", and at the same time challenge the opinions of the public?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President's world refers only to fattened lawyers, not all Canadians; it's a rather narrow concept of this concept.
In democracy, they have the right to speak, too.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of working.
The public is prepared to hear and assess the matter, but on the basis of civilised exchange of arguments, not in what many consider as a complaint, in which the defendant is to be imprisoned (as part of his complaint "public debate" Barrick has just called on the authors of Noir Canada to officially inform them that they are to stop using this term...).
If we recall the surreal Garver speech, the conspiracy initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the universal freedom of search and search for the truth that is essential for every democratic society.
It supports the right to quote confidential sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the basis for intellectual activity itself.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world, without exposing ourselves to repeated struggle, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could create it if it was guided by the scientific standards used by Noir Canada.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment that we belong to is already in a position to conduct debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s outstanding complaint clearly shows that despite what he claims, he does not have the slightest desire to conduct a transparent debate.
For the university world, it is a loss, as is for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures that would limit such unauthorized harassment.
Operations to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans Understand
Bush's administration and transfer to Congress, both Republicans and democracy, finally reached an agreement on the greatest saved economic plan since the Great Crisis of the Thirty Years.
A new version of the plan, with the help of 700 billion US dollars to reverse the financial crisis, which has been clumsy by Wall Street for months, has yet to be approved by both Chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control of the elected representatives over its applications, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of the public money saved, new measures to capture the quantities of non-payment houses and the right to monitor the amount of wages paid by the company's employees.
The US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, President of the Snow House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and the representative of the Republicans at the action table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress and we have reached an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said Bush's administrative representative, Henry Paulson.
"Everything was done so that the real economy and the ordinary Americans were safe from the crisis just going on on Wall Street," the Democrats explained.
"This is a key point: if we don't do it, trauma, chaos and the disruption of the daily life of the Americans will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the last few hours, the negotiations have taken place at the maximum rate of fear of the effect of further failures on investor deployment.
The time limit was the opening of markets this morning.
Both candidates to the US President were invited to the debate later and both expressed their agreement rather than recalling their dissatisfaction with the need to avoid such a final solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has signed an agreement on certain measures, in particular the aim of which is to enable the holders of the dwelling and the measures on the wages of the workers' states of the companies saved.
"If we ask the taxpayers to take special measures for the non-responsibility of some people, there is no reason to be congratulated.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on the waves of television.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was questioned by another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, said, "I would like to see details, but I hope so."
"The rough drawings I've read are that it's about something we're all going to have to spend and it's going to be possible to move on.
Choosing inactivity is not acceptable at all," he said.
The goal of the 700 billion-dollar plan is to buy off interest on the taxpayers' money from questionable claims and the risk and non-saleable assets of the US financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis by breaking down the bubbles on the property market, which first led to the collapse of the risk mortgage loans (subpries), then transferred to another, expanded form of loans (PCAA) and ended in the freezing of cash and in the disbursement of banks and financial institutions.
The failure of the first proposal for a previous week's agreement has been made by Members of the Republic.
Since the Democrats have agreed that for some "toxic" assets of companies with problems, the government will only handle them, but will not buy them, it is a belief that the pointless situation is blessed.
In an effort to bring the anti-conventional views to Congress, measures were introduced to ensure that the government was able to introduce new fees that would help it to recover its deposit if it had to recover losses for a period of five years as a result of the programme.
The new plan includes a contribution of the first amount of 250 billion, which will be possible to add another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The deposit of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for Washington's help, he's gonna get shares in saved companies that will pay off his dividends in case of profit, which will be able to sell again when it's all over again.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the procedures for the entertainment of properties linked to the loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits for the amount of assessment and compensation paid by the managers of the companies affected.
The planners would like to vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain that their plan will be green.
Yesterday, votes against the project continued in both the Republican and the democratic camp.
"It is quite clear that Washington is not listening," said Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Finance Commission of Snowford.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But it's not a solution to the payers."
The democratic representative Brad Sherman, a moderator of congressmen's group called "the committee of skeptics", presents the whole thing differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"The four hundred respected professors of economics, among them three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to hurry too much and carefully examine which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe has again confirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
Following the end of the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the government of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank of BNP Paribas announced that it is derogating from the purchase of its competitors, which has been in the process of collapse since it lost EUR 2 billion (EUR 2.9 billion) as a result of a crisis in the purchase of properties in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, among the 20 largest European banks and among the 10 largest insurers.
"We are not coming to this money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wooter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we get election rights in the bank and influence.
And it's just that the guards and the households can't really evaluate today."
On the other side of the La Manche channel, it seems that the British government has initiated a further bank crisis affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government had to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) constituted loans to purchase properties.
According to his yesterday's announcement, the Spanish bank of Santander will buy the branches and accounts of the clients of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has to renationalize from the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of social icons
His beauty with Azura's eyes long represented his tummy, according to other weaknesses.
Was this American actor with a fascinating smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
Humility, sensitivity, and insidious talents that were his own also distanced him from the strong category that produces real stars.
But what a long-distance runner it was!
Paul Newman died on Friday in 83 years at his ranch in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the icons of the last fat years of American cinematography.
Less than Brando, who had been like and for a long time been some rival on his film album, Newman was a more careful actor, indeed a Christian, but also an apostle of freedom and a breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and a mother of Hungarian origin.
One of these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
No exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because in it all this country was in love with a self-made man, a warrior in the war in the Pacific, wounded in a battle that began in Yale in the early 50s, then visited the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in the theater, on TV and on the streets in the film.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also a car runner, who was the second at the 24 hour competition in Le Mans in 1979, and at the same time a sexual symbol, although since 1958 he had formed a model couple with an actress Joanne Woodward.
With it, there are also the dark places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the journey of the own show-business, which will always remain to a certain degree mysterious.
A good man, in the most honourable word of meaning.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused the movie's lovers to return, while his big role together is rivaling the black payroll.
After him, more than half a century has been defiling the changing American seventh art.
In memory, a charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensible wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Cat on a burnt roof, adapted by Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From less ancient times (1990), we have his sensitive Mr. Bridge, discontented with a marriage that has failed to meet all expectations.
So many other Newman Pauls went into history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a violent, memorable delicacy from Someonebody Up There Likes Me (In the sign of hatred) Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, took over after his death, which Newman introduced in real knowledge in 1956.
A very nice gangster in The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for the best film in 1973.
A zealous and vindictive ball player in The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same character will be produced in The Color of Money Martin Scorsese, which will bring him the only Oscar with seven nominations in 1987.
This face of life, it was him.
And he's again.
In his professional career, he's going to have different times together.
Young people are especially familiar with her thanks to the cultural slap Shot George Roye Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey coach.
The fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of Coen's brothers.
He then completed his career as Irish Mafia's sister in the Road to the Perdition Sam Mendese in 2003.
Unlike several film legends, which had recently left the trade, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, perhaps judging Hollywood with his talents, performances and concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, not without a sense of humor, considered her as "a living challenge underplaying", the judge, that in his performances he pushed too much on the ball.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the role came as a lift, the profession was not always so soft.
The first lovers, however, played less often than the outsiders: neurotics, alcohols, lupus and walnuts, whose fall and sighs reflected in his perfect appearance.
As director, Newman discovered a little of the famous page of his shyness.
His film, Rachel, from 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), in which his wife, Joanne Woodward, played the main role, gives a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
To his son, Scott, who was lost because of his overdose, he dedicated a film to Harry and Son in 1984, full of shame and grief.
In the direction that Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former associate Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) proudly declared: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Charity, love of life, such are the main characteristics of a dead actor.
If we remember his legendary career, he's also a great warrior for civil rights, ecology, an independent film, a resistance to the fall of Hollywood.
Like him, we were used to seeing on bottles of vinegar, sauce, biscuits, and other foods, which we may have felt rather untasteful, even though it was at first a gag.
However, the profit from the sale went to his Children's Gift account.
Newman is so, rather than letting himself be caught in glory, he's been engaged in company for the last time.
To his five daughters he left a letter containing these words: "Always and to the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
I was honored to be here."
And it was an honor for us to follow the life course of such a clear and generous American artist.
And besides, at the end of the day, a model citizen.
What was produced in the factory on the invoice Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, October 8th, the trial of Jánosi Zuschlaga and his associates begins in criminal proceedings.
Politicians and their associates are, in addition to other criminal acts, including the burning of books, accused of fraud in the long term and systematic criminal organisations, which have resulted in extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutors, they used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and often proved to be fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and self-government - including about 65 million forints - has travelled partly into the treasure of the Fiatal Balldal organization, partly into the pockets of individuals.
The manner in which the investigating authority also informed it was based on the fact that the money obtained in public competitions was selected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real counter-value and that the company’s commitments were never met.
According to the complainant, most of the invoices were false.
Prints to these invoices came from the Jezsefváros market, the bullet seal was produced in Kiskunalas.
On behalf of which companies are to produce invoices, it was decided, inter alia, to cross the northern coast of Balaton, on which István Ladose János Zuschlag sent.
According to his statement, he was first appointed to look at the pensions and restaurants.
They applied for accounts for their consumption, according to which the invoices submitted in the course of public competitions issued by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively, were produced.
The invoice presented most of István Lados with his associate András ̈rim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the messages needed to obtain subsidies.
On his "Study Way" Lados looked at one of the basements.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlagem and his associates in 2003, this post-hospital feeding facility was provided for a group of nineteen members from Biztos Pont.
However, according to the company leader, so many people would not be able to do so at the same time.
Similarly, the invoices presented in the summer of 2002 with the name Job Jöv ̈ért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évesredért were moved with formal and substantive errors.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomy had only three rooms, more than ten people in it could not sleep one night, although the bill included a hundred and thirty guests.
However, the authors of the printing works with a rich imagination ignored this even when they quoted the documents of a company related to the so-called "Pigal s. r. o., in which, according to the information provided to the public representative, the documents bearing the name "Job Jöv" and "Hopá" did not appear.
The head of the company, Gypoz, Farkas for hvg.hu, stated that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that he was involved in false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were in the wrong place."
As he added, apart from formalizing, there was no agreement that hundreds of people were living in, so there are only eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, the invoice also included cooking, with their restaurants not working for a long time.
The top invoice producers were not even convinced that the seen Budapest travel office organised only foreign travel, and on the cash payment invoice, which was also not compatible with the company's invoice practice, the tax authorities introduced as a service to facilitate the travel to Hungary.
Furthermore, as it went through the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
On the four documents submitted by Jobb Jöv ért, Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o., did not agree, inter alia, to the amount of VAT. However, the company's activity does not include the 25%, but the 15% VAT, in addition to which the hotel's employees only presented printed invoices, the invoice made was written by hand.
In addition, the "publishers" invoice should be abolished by stating to one company how the investigation of State representations resulted, as a road transport activity, of goods which was not initially carried out on the investment advice.
The fact that invoices are issued by the donations of Együtt and Harmadik Évesredért and the companies of the 21st century. In addition to the false culturalism of Egyesület and Biztos Pont, it also broke due to formal deviations - the inappropriate format of the invoice and incorrect stamp.
Like in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that the invoices would be submitted.
For example, the facilitators did not notice that the company HIB s. o. o. from Nyíregyház was in the time (2001) when a group of Fiatal Városért, in liquidation, was being fed up with it, which is why, according to our information, the liquidating commissioner of the company also denied that the paper would be issued by him.
The invoices were deliberately displayed
The second group of invoices is made up of those who knew they were going to expose a fictional invoice.
The Esély Budapest Foundation has issued accounts for about four million forints for the Harmadik Évesredert Foundation at the request of the organization Fiatal Balldal - Ifjú Socialisták.
According to the complaint, Collab s. r. o. made a fictitious account issue of one of the accused Ludovic Györfi.
Züschlagem and his associates also cooperated with Biogate s. r. on, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 saved the funding of Job Jöv ért and Atlasz and Vörösfeny by invoices worth about five million forints that did not have real economic activity.
Nor did the movement of money, because the invoices created were later abolished, which, of course, the organizations forgot to include in their documents.
Another group of invoiced companies is those that have been bound to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the representative of the Ukrainian contractor Delta Trió s. r. o., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company submitted a number of invoices for the sale of the computer equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data from the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kishinhalast company, Cash Investment s. r. o., which was in liquidation from 14 September 2005.
One of these companies was a man from Romania who was supposed to hand over the books about Ivan Kubatov in the years 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, admitted that on behalf of the company, he issued invoices to the companies Atlas, Hoppa and the hope of Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and accepted their objection.
At the request of Ivan Kubatova, Romanian farmers were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
However, not one of the companies actually worked, according to the defendant, because they had no job.
However, he benefited from his business because, at the request of the co-indicted attorney Zsolta Szente, who also prepared their charters, he presented the company's invoices to Atlas and Y-Generació connected to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the company Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade he gave Kubatov a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
State representations have concluded that Kubatov has accounted for 10 per cent of the amounts shown in invoices and VAT.
To expose fictional invoices, this time to the selection procedure for the company Biztos Pont, a man also used Szi-Beri k.t.
Spolky Y-Generació and Sövetség and Modern Magyarországért presented proposals to the public in January 2006 to the Nadace Mikhalye Táncsicse (TMA), a public welfare organisation of the socialist party.
They obtained 500 thousand units, but did not impose the amounts on the objectives set out in the proposals.
To avoid this, TMA submitted five fictional invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were last found during a home visit at the Arpád Kemecsei's office in the Ministry of Education.
During the counting of the part of the defendants, he will probably describe the course of the production of invoices, as he has already done in the prosecutor's office.
It may be more interesting if you decide to reveal the main defendant János Zuschlag.
His present statement is not too detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to show everything in detail, he has not done so yet.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for the payment of a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, the socialists may have concluded an agreement with him, and Zusi will take it on himself.
He could have been offended by the fact that his application for a reduction in the conditions of his detention, because of being placed in prison, had not been heard.
While the perpetrators of economic crime, who have suffered much greater damage than they have done, can go through freely or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychology of suffocating: Why are we wasting more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, to overestimate goods.
The neurological and economic basis of this well-known - and apparently irrational - behavior has been able to reveal to researchers in the field of neurology and economy of New York University.
According to their study, published in Science magazine, people don't want to stay in eBay auction competition, so they'd rather pay too high a price.
Research with experimental auction tried to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers agreed, the other group participated in field auctions, using the method of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) examined the active area of the brain of the pilots.
In both games, participants could win money, however in the auction game, the important element of which is to interrupt the other side, began to function intensively when losing a whole located under the brain cortex, called the striatum.
This brain area plays in addition to many other functions in the "self-re rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, it is possible, according to researchers, to explain how to avoid the direct reaction of the street.
In support of their theory, members of the research team from a number of economists carried out a financial cross-check investigation.
Under different conditions, three groups have been competing against one partner.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product concerned and made commitments.
In addition, members of the other group were promised that if they quit winning, they would get another $15.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also paid these money.
Thus, the difference between the two groups was based on the fact that one was highlighted by the victory and the other loss.
However, members of the "lost" group were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "victory" group, confirming the neurologist's hypothesis.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
For so far, they have explained the phenomena observed in auctioning the joys of winning and avoiding the risk.
When neurological imaging methods helped us to resolve the dispute between these two theories so that we have now reached the third explanation," observed Andrew Schotter, professor of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to look for a doctor?
About half a billion people around the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be hundreds of thousands, but only seven thousand of them are treated, because the patient often does not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is a summary of the names of liver infections caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, which are signs of inflammation of the liver and the stomach, however, the cause of the disease and the disease they cause differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways depending on the underlying disease: hepatitis type A and E (e.g. food-infected, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other blood and body fluids (sperms, secretion, lungs).
In any case, travellers should be protected by choking against A and B, and no vaccine C virus exists.
Hepatitis A symptoms occur two to three weeks after the food is used, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, chest problems, vomiting.
Then, on the skin and the eye whites, there is a yellow, bright chair and a thin urine. Treatment can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year millions of people around the world die from the more serious type of this disease, from liver cancer and from hepatitis B-induced liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is that according to estimates, only every tenth infected medicinal product is treated.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to liver surgery or liver cancer.
Most of those infected with their disease don't even know, the cause of the disease destroys the liver cells permanently, so the first symptoms are delivered in many cases up to 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, regular testing is very important.
In the three groups, this disease occurs more often than on the average: between people who passed blood transfusions before 1991, between drug users and people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C 200 million is estimated.
Since the disease can show a routine laboratory examination, a person should, in case he notices any signs of unknown origin, turn to his practical doctor.
In early detection, the disease is therapeutic, the virus can be removed from the body, preventing such infections and preventing cancer.
September 30th is the World Day of Hepatitis, which was first organized worldwide by organisations representing the disease in 2004.
Its purpose is to note the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of their formation and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Who believes in God, it's so bad?
According to recent research, belief in God works as a certain analgesic, which may have facilitated the death of already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examined how belief in the god of perception of pain is influenced by the British Telegraph.
Within a lot of bizarre research, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while all observed the painting showing Miss Maria.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique, a detailed study of the human brain has also shown that Catholics have been able to activate this part of their brain that is responsible for controlling pain.
Research is the first of a series of studies attended by scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
The test was carried out in such a way that the left hand of the test subject was attached to the creative instrument that issued electrical shocks.
The researchers asked participants to give an honest view of two paintings: Sassoferratt, Miss Marie, from the 17th century and Lady with the border of Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the view of Miss Marie would give the believers a certain state of worship, while da Vinci’s image was chosen because it was not too different from the first and acted in a soothing way.
The pilots spent half an hour in the MRI scan and during this time they received in four consecutive parts of 20 electroshocks, while watching the picture separately with religious or general themes.
The Catholics said that when they looked at Miss Maria, they felt "safe" as if they were "old" and "slow down, filled them with peace".
As they watched the image with religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain than Leonard’s work was before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved by means of any powerful image even in atheists, just to find the right photograph.
"We should find a picture that will be very positive, from the position of mother or father," the psychologist said.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the research results.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases also change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of how the effect on the regulation of the pain of the believers should be if they were shown some of Leonard’s Madonna or similar calibre.
Would it mean looking at Miss Marie's quality to achieve even better results?
You're what you're gonna share
About their tenth birthdays, Google can declare that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above; they know where they were on vacation, which is going through a professional examination and what they're interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, it's still not enough.
However, with respect to skeptics, doing parallels with Orwell's dark vision, the very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very basic web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to gather even more personal data about users, which is necessary to enable the founders of Google to keep their original intention: "Let's organize all the information in the world!"
According to the spokesperson, the company is standing after ten years of secular work just before it can work with all the information.
For a question which will be five years, Schmidt answered that if Google could answer questions like "What am I going to do tomorrow?" or "what work would actually be worth me?" - for such seemly simple questions, however, software will not be able to answer until they know enough about users.
Not all users of the Internet know well that the exact search words are captured during the internet search and the IP addresses from which and on which sites the interested parties have moved after the search.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, users can, for example, keep the history of their surfing, look back at what they were looking for and what they clicked on, and then generate in the long term the findings adapted to them more directly - the same logic will also be based on the Recommendations service, through which we will be able to offer products and services based on the above-mentioned and retained preferences.
What if my data is being used against me, what if someone sees what I'm doing? - users who have fear when looking at Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company is even more dangerous, the reaction does not raise in internet users awareness of guilt, fear of torture, desire for freedom or even resistance to power.
However, it is confirmed that all the terms sought are not only caught, but in justified cases a third party may also be issued, in such legal cases the personal rights of internet users do not escape.
The most well-known example of the past has been about a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided information to the Brazilian government that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the community sites of Orkut established through it.
However, Internet users who are afraid of personal rights could still breathe in May, when the company had successfully proved its truth in the dispute with the FBI by hand with the EFF electronic rights organization: Google must not be forced to provide any information requested by the FBI in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully defended nearly fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it obtained with a call for reinforcement before the year of the adopted law on the protection of children, but failed to obtain the list of individual user entries, and the full list of web pages and keywords for two months.)
Google’s view is quite different: it is targeted at those who are afraid to provide their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be by using Google’s services exposed to injury, and they come out against it with a revolution that belongs to supranational companies with conservative images.
And so far the American geek of culture and its wildest breed, grouping around itself excited computer fans, activists and users, who appear in many countries, in it sees a new generation of big-timers, "corporations that are now far away", unlike his rival Microsoft, considered for Windows as the world's vendors, as they both fight for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that Google does not require an identification code from its users and does not want money after them for its applications; open, free and constantly fresh source of information and package of programs acts as much more accessible, younger, "cooler" than the practice of official software.
However, it can also be caused by the fact that geeks have a very problematic internet and personal rights relationship, which has brought with them one of the key words of the last few years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing but cooperation, that we deliberately leave traces behind and use the communication channels that we have available, and even though their range is for everyone else, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can lead a profile right now on a number of community sites from Facebook to Xang, which can connect to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm applications, recording his listening music, all of which can then connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, besides, he can write a blog that will automatically discover his latest photo gallery, which will be stored on Flickr or Picasa.
However, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases, from which she explains: a friend in the morning looking at the flood of photos of shared friends will easily find out who her crazy friend spent the night, or the company can throw out his employee only because on his blog he will express his sincere opinion about top management: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely overestimated today.
The person who lives online is made up of what he shows himself, so we could define the basics behind today's youth behavior.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least avoid the Google monopoly has the option (Scrooglem, which uses the Google search system, however, is not deliberately affected by the results).
A small number of people, for example, are not registered on community sites so they can not be found. Online Google application from the text editor after photoeditor and the news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to large server parks and that do not set us the best possible profile.
Public opinion is not too secretive to expect when Google shows teeth.
The company has a current value of $156 billion higher than IBM $140 billion), Intel $124 billion or Coca Cola $110 billion, AdWords/AdSense auction areas are threatening the investment of advertising agencies and services that are constantly being introduced at a fast pace, making life difficult not only for Microsoft but also for many other software designers.
However, critical observers also find counterpoints that are disturbing: for example, top management rejected employees' protests after a double fee for company school, whether the daily feeding of employees was too expensive under the company's leadership, all of which is lost in addition to the fact that in 2006 Google was still hiding before the Chinese government and, in the sense of their agreements, filtering every finding that is due to good taste, and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never presupposes new services, only when it can be used, is certain, however, that the expected problems of the following months and years can move around the world in new places: while some believe that the Google project aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines has such dimensions that the company will soon have something to do with the American Supreme Court, others fear its health system, in which we can build a complete own health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database, then it can serve as a good source of material even for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the famous novel of Cory Doctor's "Scrooged" describes the future with Orwell's reminisces, in which one can safely approach the person with only data from Google.
A double killer from the Uzda helped to remove two young people’s footprints
Two young people listened to the police in the case of a double murder in Ozda, according to reasonable suspicion they helped to eliminate the result of this crime, said Borsod's Chief Police Department spokesperson on Tuesday.
Persons who have been suspected have been found and are currently accused of aiding a criminal offence.
Both young people, according to MTI two girls, are released.
Helping a criminal is punishable by the deprivation of liberty for up to 5 years.
Suspected of double murder in Ozda, a 23-year-old man, he was taken into temporary custody on Sunday.
He's suspected of a criminal crime in advance of the planned multiple-carriage murder for real reasons.
During the investigation, it appeared that a 23-year-old man owed a 53-year-old man a higher amount.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt, so he sent his creditor out on Wednesday to an operating room in Ozda, where he first killed a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, a young man was prepared to commit a crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed a murder weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy a Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - offered a Warsaw Stock Exchange for buying a percentage package of shares of Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party, although the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, who wants 60 percent of the securities to sell in a few months.
According to the Czech economic journal E15, Poland's offer represents the highest amount that was offered by the interested parties to the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech papers, the sale of the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, and the Deutsche Börse were offered.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange Petr Koblic said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all stakeholders, and he did not rule out that it could lead to the collapse of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by the stock market experts to be 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders agreement, approximately 90 per cent of shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank of Patria Finance, with approximately 25% share, followed by the Czech Sprinkler with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of the European Charters
In their Tuesday comments devoted to the deepening international financial crisis, the pre-European lists already mention "the second 11 September".
We can thank the American President for the global financial disaster, who blames the Romanian La Repubblica. The President has not even been able to wipe out his own side in support of the soon-earned bill aimed at correcting this desperate situation...
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, which reminded the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about the second of September 11th.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the guilty in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the world economy has led to the collapse of the lack of political leadership.
The threat of the collapse of the American financial system is constantly growing, and the world will eventually pay for it.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but after the Congress vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political instrument to solve the crisis.
The world's economy is hanging in the air - just when one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, the female journal Tages-Anzeiger points out.
To date, individual states may place a life-saving circle at the disposal of the corrupting monetary institutions and taxable persons may save them from the scourge.
However, if the other banks collapse like dominoes, then there will be no more money and no more improvisation.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to move across their national selfishness and to unite control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the dominant monetary institutions received more than 100 billion euros, recalling the Vienna Der Standard, who are afraid that, like the Americans, in the interest of solving the crisis, they will have to reach deeper into the pocket and European taxpayers, even more real.
The European Union is facing a crisis that is falling like a tsunami in the old continent until it is really gone.
"Savers" do not have to have the billions of euros right away, however, it would be good if they determined firmly, in which case it is reasonable to collect money from taxpayers to get even more damage.
Smart car simulates fly boots
What would be the best way to develop technologies that are able to prevent collisions, if not the imitation of detectors of obstacles occurring in the world of nature?
For example, at the bee.
It was a strategic idea of a surprising project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC fair, that led engineers from Nissan Schmeláci. It was about building a new generation of systems that prevent collisions.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan designed a biomimetic robotic system for the management of the type BR23C, a robot mine equipped with the properties of the hives, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the summer, every rabbit creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is in fact very similar to our safety protection package," explained Kazuhiro Doi, the Director-General of the label for the area of technological PR and research and development.
An important role is played by complex eyes, which in turn enable the eye to see in all directions in the golden angle more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eye, the engineers sought the idea of a laser remote.
It identifies the obstacles up to 2 metres ahead of the BR23C in the 180 degrees field, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the ship's microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an operation aimed at preventing a collision.
The obstacle is caught during a second break, then the robot car begins to simulate the movements of the bees and the rotation of the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the impact immediately changes the direction.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidable manoeuvre takes place in an instinctive manner.
"If not, the robot car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Robotic Car Project.
It must respond instinctively and immediately, because this technology is the most vulnerable and internal level of safety protection package, within which the impact is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bees do to avoid further bees.
This process must not last longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike the bees, this movement cannot be directed up, down or down, it can only be two-dimensional and only in a direction that can turn the wheel.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered by the bees when they are avoided, only the possibility of turning, speeding and slowing was applied in the case of a robot car.
BR23C uses lithium polymer accumulators that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have a longer life than lithium-ionte variants.
According to Andoa, an important instinctive, intelligent response, not the ability to process, is less then storing data.
This mechanism must process and react only to several incoming signals in a second.
There is no need to keep them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so he always uses only memory of the size of a few kilobytes.
He doesn't need a giga or megabyte capacity memory.
This is the first step in the development of a technology that serves as an immediate escape, which, according to Nissan's estimate, could be achieved in seriously manufactured vehicles over the course of ten years.
Another option of application may be to connect the unit to a GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the motorist to the ultimate goal when he is off the road.
The damn precious child already has a name.
The Savings Package Act, worth 700 billion dollars, which is to be distributed into several instalments and whose purpose is to redeem the bank's non-quality loans, already has a written form.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further talks, which ended Saturday after the middle of the American East Time, representatives of Congress reached an agreement on a lasting debate on the rescue package of $700 billion, announced by the Reuters agency.
"We have made significant progress," announced Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the House of Representatives, according to which only the signing of the agreement is left.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said about the result of the compromise: "The programme will work and be effective, but further steps must be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 o'clock on the night of Washington time (then Monday at 2 o'clock in the morning of the Central European time), but no special entry into stock exchanges was possible.
The proposal for a legal standard to be heard on behalf of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which is to be established, will be voted on by the representatives of Sweden first Monday, followed by a number at the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosio on Saturday night, then the news of the agreement was also welcomed at the White House.
"With the progress achieved at night, we are satisfied and very much appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilise our financial markets and to protect our economy," Tony Fratto, a spokesperson of the White House.
The programme is still different from the original proposal by the Bush administration, in which it was supposed to be in order to purchase the non-quality securities secured by mortgages at a cost of $700 billion.
It is now possible to lose in the first half of the amount of 700 billion, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the event, as expected on Monday, will be decided by the Congress, and the Ministry of Finance will buy them valuable securities secured by mortgages, which are valued as non-quality, the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special body, which will also be chaired by the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half of the $700 billion will depend on the Congress's next decision.
The Ministry of Finance may, in the sense of the law, apply a combined tactic: it can at the same time purchase non-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, and other "sweet" loans.
The purchase may take place within an auction and directly by the competent representatives of the Ministry.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in the insurance programme, in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with guarantees for funds representing a cause for concern, for which the company will then pay the price corresponding to the amount of the damage expected.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to ensure that the urgent requirements of the American financial system are met up to $700 billion, whether it is a large purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the prevention of the systemic risk associated with the collapse of some of the large money institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to introduce the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
The banks that have been in trouble and are waiting for state aid can, on the other hand, be counted by the government reducing their distance - which is simply called a "gold fall" in the seabed.
In addition, these restrictions will depend on the way in which they are granted to the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the ministry purchases within the auction, a tax deduction will be imposed on gold deposits if the bank's directors do not fall directly into retirement.
In the case of direct purchase of non-quality loans, the government will aggressively step forward in order to ensure that the money for management is not overrun.
It should be added that the existing Gold Drops Agreements will not change, the restrictions apply only to new contracts, which should be a further incentive for participation in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history when there will be legal restrictions on the remuneration of directors-general," commented the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services of the Representatives' Chamber, the Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State in the participating banks will have the right to a share programme, which reduces the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy and the economy and the saved bank are put on foot, they can also benefit from this transaction.
The draft plan contains that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal determining how taxable persons can recover expected losses from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were also voices expressing in connection with the plan of doubt.
"The American citizens did not ask us for this, this is the dollar of taxpayers' non-refoulement," a Republican congressman from California Darrell Issa said.
His democratic colleague from Ohia Mary Kaptur, the judge, demanded exactly who was responsible for the collapse of Wall Street when the provisions were adopted.
Industrial prices continued to grow
Domestic sales prices in industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008, compared with 12.9 per cent in August 2007, the Central Statistical Office announced.
Export sales prices in the industry increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent, respectively.
Production prices in the industry were, as a result of changes in domestic and export prices compared to the previous month, more than 0.7 per cent, respectively, by 3.2 per cent.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by only a minimum of 0.1 per cent in the previous month.
Also domestic sales prices in the processing industry increased slightly, by 0.1 per cent, compared with July.
The highest price increase in the steel and footwear industry (2.8 per cent) in August 2008 was mainly due to an inter-monthly increase in prices in the brewery and silk products sector by 4.6 per cent, respectively, of footwear production by 2.5 per cent.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical and product production sector (1.6 per cent).
Prices fell in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the wood industry (0.1 per cent).
Prices for paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the processing industry, we measured an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sector, which are of high importance in the domestic industry, the price increased by 0,3 per cent in August, particularly with the continued effect of the officially determined increase in the prices of gas from 1 July.
In the twelve-month comparison of domestic stays in individual sectors of the processing industry, prices grew most in the oil processing industry (32.4 per cent).
In the raw materials sector, it was possible to observe 13,2 per cent in the production of foodstuffs, beverages and tobacco products, which are of decisive weight and then an 11 per cent increase in prices.
Prices fell in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent) and the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price growth ranged from 0.6 to 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the processing industry increased by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water production and distribution industry exceeded prices from the previous year by 18.7 percent.
From the point of view of the division, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was observed in August in the sectors involved in the production of heavy assets.
In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices increased by 0,3 per cent, in the energy processing and further processing sectors did not change the prices in view of the previous month.
The highest price increase in view of the same month of the previous year was possible in August 2008 in the energy processing and further processing sectors (16.8%).
In the consumer sectors, we measured an increase in prices of 6.8 per cent, rather than a fall in prices of 1.4 per cent.
The export sales prices of the industrial products measured in the ones concerned increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, with a decrease of 3.9 per cent in the twelve-month comparison.
Our domestic payments decreased by 1.7 per cent in one month, by 7.1 per cent in the case of the dollar, compared with July 2007, by 7.5 per cent in the case of the euro, and by 15.9 per cent in the case of the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
According to King Gönczov, it is a great hope that around 12 January, the US-Dutch agreement on wireless communication will enter into force, ministers of foreign affairs spoke about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her opinion, "now almost everything depends only on whether an electronic system of road call is being built at sea, respectively."
At the same time, she pointed out that the new system would not be allowed to enter, but tourists would have to register before leaving.
The representative of the Hungarian diplomat from today continues in negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Condoleezzo Rice, who will hand over the Central Cross with the Star of the Order to the favour of the Republic of Hungary and conduct talks with the foreign policy adviser of the Presidential Candidate of the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and the Republic of John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for bank savings packages
Barack Obama and John McCain, presidents of both major American parties, agreed on Sunday to ensure their support for the government's bank's bailout package worth 700 billion dollars, although they are also politicians who require a half-year-old minister of finance.
After several marathon talks with Congress and administrative representatives, early Sunday morning was announced: the basic agreement on the bank's rescue package was concluded.
A financial package aimed at overcoming the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market became a central issue for the presidential campaign.
Like Obama, McCain is accordingly referred to as the most suitable candidate for the country to emerge from the economic crisis.
According to the most thorough research at the same time as they got to the front of the economic issue, Obama gained a certain benefit again and came to McCain's conclusion, which he secured after the Republican Convention appointing Sarah Palinová as Vice-President.
Obama expressed his hope on Sunday at a pre-election meeting in Detroit Sunday that the package law of 700 billion would quickly be adopted by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained passports relating to consumer protection, which it also supports.
"We must act immediately, responsible (...) to your places, savings, the entire industry, the stability of the whole economy is at risk," said the 35,000 crowd.
He didn't let himself miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy to the elderly.
McCain, in his interview with the ABC TV station, said, "All of this will be a little bit of a cause (...) but nothing is simply not possible."
As stated by the Republican Senator, the proposal provides for the establishment of a commission to oversee the financial affairs and the limitation of the derogation for the top representatives to which it was due.
Obama told the CBS station that McCain had no more important role in the negotiations, but he was himself in everyday contact with the minister.
The president of the House of Jehovah's Witnesses, Nancy Pelosi, announced on Sunday that the representative of Sweden would vote on the bill on Monday.
Print preview of the German language area
The right camp is unbreakable, only the voters within it have become more self-aware - thus analysing the weak outcome of CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiderovs are prepared to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The mirror (speel.de)
In the online issue of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its father" causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to a well-known politician, CSU's erosion began a long time ago before his office took over Beckstein-Huber's sad duo.
For decades, Christian Socialists have been restoring Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are being shunned.
The settlement of the period is, however, a problem for the whole of Christian democracy, and this is also for Angela Merkel.
The debate was not entirely surprising for the CSU, however, the process ended on Saturday, which could have been predicted for almost ten years: it ended the undisputed hegemony of one state party.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, CSU reached 47.7 per cent, first from the 50th year below the 50% limit.
This was repeated three years ago during the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, which is still in the most frequently remembered Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernization that CSU has consistently carried out in this country that feeds its parents.
Sociologists have predicted this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong in the dance. Secularization, educational results, settlement of the Germans from the east and from the north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not be without the result of the loyalty of the CSU volunteers.
Modernisation is linked to the growth of opportunities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The fair camp is unbreakable, only the voters inside it have become more self-conscious, more critical, more self-concealed.
It is also evident that in recent weeks, the CSU has distanced most of its classical civil levels; people in the free profession, the employers, the graduates and the students.
This has already been supported by CSU below 40 per cent.
The Press (depresse.com)
The conservative Viennese diary is in its article entitled "Who, with whom? The presidents are in the questions of the resistance coalition" refers to the confused domestic situation created by the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to deal with the EVP.
The SGEI commands the involvement of the SGEI in its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears to be open to all negotiations, greens still do not want to fall on the wheel.
The elections are behind us, now all around the coalition; in the debate organised on public television, the Presidents did not let themselves be looked at in their cards.
The president, SpÖ Werner Faymann, confirmed that he wished to deal with the EPP.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two sides is certainly possible - in some countries and in social partnership.
The question is whether he will introduce himself to the coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the EVP, as Vice-Chairman, left Faymann open.
As he said, Schüssel-Multier's course was re-elected at every turn.
Repeating this direction does not come into consideration.
Molterer responded to the red bids carefully.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere with the internal affairs of the EEAS.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is now completely open, these questions need to be discussed in a decisive way within the EEAS.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider once again appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black coals, we are prepared to take on government responsibilities," Haider said.
Jaróková: You need to break the charmed circle of poverty and segregation
In Paris today, the European Summit of Equality, which this year is hosted by France, the current Presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóková, Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of the professional qualification in her message, paid attention to the assembly in school because it is one of the most serious abuses of Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
The Summit started - on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The representatives of the governments, the European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil society activities in the field of equal opportunities have been present.
According to Fidesz Járóková, the press office of the Eurogroup of Members of the Movement pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination in recruitment, the Roma are expelled from the European labour market primarily from their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education and, as a result of the poor quality of basic education, they can achieve a higher level of education only a small part of them."
Jaroque further stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role to play in the application of other human rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children may mean strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to establish the awareness of these relationships in the broadest circles - between Roma and non-Roman children.
The sooner the Roma student starts school, the more likely it will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and consumer taxes they contribute to the national budget.
"Romans have the right of their citizens of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their lack of quality and separate education," said Livia Járóková.
According to the honourable Member, cohesion of the European Union is needed, with a focus on the objective and the negotiations, to speed up the process of disaggregation of schools, which is primarily important for the proper enforcement of existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"It is necessary to break the charmed circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, to provide Roma children with the possibility of democratic space so that they can participate as full-fledged citizens in the future of Europe," Járóková asked.
For everyone, the European Year of Equal Opportunities, the objective of the European Equality Summit, organised annually since the last meeting in Berlin, is to ensure a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination at the level of Europe as a whole and of individual Member States.
CSU: temporary mercy
The fate of the obedient two Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October.
Even during the ignominious election debate, the debate on personal questions has been postponed by the points of the Bavarian CSU.
The president of Erwin Huber and the country Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still sit in their seats, the question is as long as this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered the disastrous 17% loss of votes, will be decided by the party's extraordinary congress last October weekend.
In any case, members of the highly criticised duo were told that they would not fall into their ranks out of all strength.
They tried to calm down the angry members of the group and the basics, who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Bavoric tsunami" export of personal consequences.
Five years ago - true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who is at the top of his career - he gained 60.7 percent of the Christian-Social Union, now, year after year against Stoiber, but she had only 43.4 percent of the strength.
In Bavaria, CSU produced 18% of the German HDP "self-control" over 46 years.
They still have conservatives in the southern shelf country, which has key importance for the Hungarian economy, high status, but in the future they will be forced into the coalition anyway.
One of the first signs of reorganisation within the party is that a member of a close expert team, which launches a panel discussion on the possible coalition of the MNP government with the liberal FDP, respectively, with a legally oriented free-voiling assembly, will also be the Vice-President and Co-Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber.
It is ironic to believe that Gabriele Pauli, who used the Huber-Beckstein duo against Stoiber to carry out the coup, got into the dream with the free will candidate, but then with ambitious municipal politics they made an unmistakable short process.
The leaders of CSU now focus all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
During the transitional period, the active role will also be played by Stoiber, who has so far built up the lines from the background, the former prime minister of the country and the former president of CSU called on 28 September the most painful day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made several touching remarks to the CDU, according to him, they would be much more supportive of the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning for both CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become an office unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success in 2005, does not, by any means, put together the forces at their feet.
According to Merkel, who, because of the fiasco, was hard to hide her disappointment, would not lose the position of CSU negatively impact on the Berlin Great Coalition.
Which is, of course, relative: to treat the wounded CSU will not be easier and the crisis of social democrats continues.
The SPD achieved 18.6 per cent of the worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Liquorice:opposite - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, no opposition MP came to the Belarusian Parliament.
According to the Russian observers, this can be explained by the blessings and stability of the country led by Alexandr Lukashenko, namely by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE) the laws to which the vote was taken.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not know the elections.
Although the 110-member legislative body of the 10 million country has been losing its opposition for ten years, the opposition combined on behalf of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections really hoped that Lukashenko, who left behind a change in the constitution in the elections with a debateable period in 2006 and the fourth to renew his presidential mandate, would "allow" to appear in parliament several opposition MPs.
That's how ODS left the pre-considered boycott.
In the background of the opposition, Russia was increasingly economically dependent on Belarus - which has consistently taken credit for the slowing down of Russian imports of natural gas and has also contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, the country's own gas pipelines, has become more dependent on Russia - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the Belarusian political establishment assessed as anti-democratic Lukashenko and the other high position of politics, no entry permits.
It was pointed out earlier that during the evaluation of the pre-election campaign, the OSCE focused on positive moves, and not on deficiencies - for example, on the ban on candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OBSE's Monday flash report has already received awards for the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not, in principle, appear in the press, especially since the opposition cannot be able to count the votes.
At the same time, it is possible to feel only improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released for freedom and Minsk is willing to engage with Moscow and in smaller confrontations, if it continues to refuse to recognize Georgia's remote South Ossetia and Abkhazia, perhaps Russia, with which Belarus forms the state of the alliance, has considered these two territories to be independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that he has started a dialogue between Belarus and the EU," said our letter Alexandr Milinkevič.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain, even though "it was too much to be left to the insignificant parliament of a single member of the opposition".
In view of the results of the opposition, he does not plan protests, rather he tries to give his message to the voters about the need for economic reforms.
"With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, the distribution of barriers to local authorities, but I can see that the change supports as many people as possible, even among the parents," said Milinkevic, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its greatest success, does not count as the right or the most officially supported level of pensioners.
"Because of the country's debt and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time when social security will collapse 'increasing silent graves'," Milinkevič judges.
Unlike opposition policy, Russian observers have assessed elections as democratic.
The Community's leading mission of independent states Sergei Lebedév, Russian news agency Ria Novosti, said that "people do not believe in words but acts", so the absence of opposition is nothing but evidence of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It's the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that a turning door was introduced at the time of the arrival and departure of the employees.
From now on, however, this new measure against anointed people, against those who are thirsty and then go to coffee at work.
The newspaper against the Lenhos was presented today by Minister for Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and Secretary-General of the Presidential Council, Maurem Masi.
"The turning door - says Brunetta - is a tool for better work, higher performance, more presentations and more services" explains the minister.
"Now there will be a new period of responsibility and transparency.
It's reformism," says Brunetta.
We will complete the establishment of the Chigi Palace in all the buildings of the Council's presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of turning doors is important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections on the part of employees, the Secretary-General assures us: "It was a common procedure with workers and the cooperation of all."
In short, no breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven in the morning."
During a conference at the Higher Education School for Public Administration
in Rome, the minister will finally announce that during three months the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, which means 60 thousand more people a year at work."
And it adds that it is necessary for Italian public administration to become more efficient
"their payout dynamics – the Minister explains – have doubled over the past 8-10 years in terms of the private sector and is far higher than inflation".
In the meantime, thousands of public employees met to reject the Brunett decree, in accordance with the request supported by Codacons.
"The Minister of Public Administration today presents figures concerning the lower absence of work due to the disease – writes consumer protection association – the nation of 'pillar chains' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct employees in public administration who have gathered to declare war against the illegal standards contained in the decree."
In Taru it will be protested in particular against the exclusion of hospital allowances which depend on activities; the extension of the period in which it is possible to check the time limits for the inspection visits and the other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Work injuries, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day there will be 2,500 work injuries in Italy, three people will die, and twenty-seven will remain disabled.
Inail's values confirm that in 2007, we have approximately 1,200 deaths as a result of work injuries.
These values testify to the seriousness of the ban, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deaths compared to murders.
In order to regain the attention of the institutions, social and information media regarding this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of Labour Impact Victims set on the second week of October.
"The worrying data extended by Anmil and those tragic reports these days confirm the importance of the question of job security," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for Frozen and Disabled at Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its deep concern for the continued joint efforts to ensure safety at work, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of families of victims and the participation of the public opinion."
"Naturally, there has been an overcrowded 'sufft', a genuinely shared face in the face of tragedy, which in their scope provokes the dissatisfaction in the media and participation in public opinion, but every day reality again offers us dramatic cases, even repeating in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is also a source problem here: it is crucial to invest in education and information.
In particular, numerous initiatives are being undertaken in the field of education so that young people facing the world of work can gain a clearer understanding.
It is necessary to pay attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its worrying social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini, on his part, stressed that "the death resulting from the job rate creates an absolutely critical social state, how it violates the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort to put an end to this state."
"As for the work impact data, it seems to be showing some positive turn, but it does not deny that the number of deaths due to job losses is as alarming," noted President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli again.
"We don't want this "reduction effort" to lead to less attention, because it's just as soon as attention gets up, tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that in general there is still too little to stop the problem of impact and there are many activities that may have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, according to our opinion - Mercandelli stressed - to increase controls and inspections, but also to engage more strongly in the training of workers, from the age of school."
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and public opinion.
But there is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers to the phenomenon, which represents an exceptional social phenomenon."
Mercandelli has finally declared that it is a progressive degeneration of the level of the right to compensation for the victims of work and the "relieving of support care" to which the system has been granted in recent years."
"The aim is, therefore, to return the worker's insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who hurt himself should not depend on spontaneousness or giving time from time to time to the legislator."
Mp3 players accused, exposed to risk hearings
Listening to longer sound music and using portable audio devices as Mp3 players may cause permanent hearing damage.
According to today's Communication from the European Commission, which quoted the opinion of the Committee on Health Risks recently established and identified (Csserri) Eu in an official report extended in Brussels.
"From this scientific point of view – we read in the notes – it follows that 5-10% of those who for at least five years listen to music using portable musical instruments, weekly more than an hour a day and maintain a high-speed device, risk permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that so many young people who often use portable audio devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can inadvertently harm their hearing in an uncorrected way," admits Meglen Kuneva.
"From scientific findings – the leader continues – there is a clear risk and it is necessary to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we have to encourage the consumer and publish this information.
We need to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific discovery so that they become fully effective and keep pace with new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"Scientists – the executive officer of the Eu – confirm that care needs to be taken and the European Commission is now checking together with other members and parties who have raised the problem of what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and young people from noise exposure, whose origin is portable musical devices and similar devices."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable audio devices to 100 dB but raises concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by excessive exposure of noise-like forms.
It is very possible to limit these damage by looking for solutions such as lower levels and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee of Eu states that users of portable music devices, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for a period of only five hours a week, will currently exceed the applicable limits corresponding to the maximum permitted sound at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for a long time risk lasting loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their quantity can be counted between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany leaves the Commission free movement for the future of the capital
Today we start, we close in March, we'll have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to workers "The Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning in its new residence behind Caracall's spa.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and other 49 members of the Commission will draw up handbooks for Rome.
When the door is closed in March, Giunta and the General Council will evaluate the analysis and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" Campidoglia and his advisor Gianniho Alemann in June.
"The Commission is completely independent and there are all political, social and cultural ideas – it wants to highlight Germano – it will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will finally be used by political decision makers remaining in Gionta and the General Council.
It's not about any exchange of functions, but it's just about trying to have a place to work on a large project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and will then be dissolved, because these institutions must have a precise time limit.
In June – the mayor announces – we present a strategic plan and use the work that the Commission has done for the future of the capital of Rome."
To the one who accuses the Commission of inefficiency, given that its views will not be binding, the German branch: "Everything depends on the work which the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of quality, like the Commission's Attali's proposals, and I am sure of this in Rome, its benefit will be decisive.
Too often politics will pay off everyday problems and emergencies that will arise from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is neither an excessive business nor a bluff: it is completely free, the citizens of Rome will not become the euro and serve to think and engage the best intelligence in the capital".
For Germany, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan as a starting point, neither definitive nor immediate, so that it is possible to allow our city an authentic rise to the level it needs, and to think by the united spirit of its future."
The future, which, clarifys the mayor of Rome "will not only be limited to the current general border, but will look much further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of the capital, but also "including the role that Rome can and must play as the capital city of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
One famous American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with an enemy of Islam."
Attacks against Obama are growing just as the date of the elections is approaching.
One lady from Miami wrote on the web: "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the courage: he thinks he's going to get to the highest post of the nation, who has all two governors and five black senators."
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; they are attacks of a clearly racial origin and do not answer the question of volunteers: will he be a good president? And then we have surveys; everyone says that Obama wins and with a big jump.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, U.S.A., wrote a comment: at least once in the polling booth, we know well who gives his voice to the American patriot.
There's a page of American mentality that's been kept secret until the last moment.
Tell me what you want, we'll finally take care of ourselves if Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear that if Obama were to win, we'd leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
However, in spite of all this considerations for the Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
1500 people were asked: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America's changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent him home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers died, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq became most of Bush's weakness.
Whoever gets into Georgia W will have to do a huge task.
The U.S. Economic collapse has also been felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" press.
POW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about their profession status and the assumption of the future.
Well, today almost all reporters are pessimistic about their future.
However, the questions did not openly say that they were less concerned about confidentiality.
He doesn't feel isolated like he used to.
The problem is for American journalists money, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of a ruined economic model.
In addition, in the rooms where editors work to put the newspapers together, there is a huge problem.
According to the reporters in question, it is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to change as the general public understands it.
American reporters come across clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press and executive seniors are convinced that a national newspaper is issuing the wrong way.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for reporters to see where the web goes.
More publishing will take the way to the Internet, which many look at as a "killer" print.
"Economic pressure" to which reporters point has increased by 79%.
Five hundred of the reporters in question admitted that they were failing technology in the hope that their newspaper was "doing something good".
The biggest breakthrough in American journalism is among those who run newsrooms – that means leaders – and reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at national level are sure that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value decreases to 23%.
This has something to do with "security of work."
Leaders who think that losing a job over three years is 47% at national level.
As for journalists, they move 30%.
As for "certain work" concerning staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists are working on the contract.
In a vast nation like Usa, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TVs and the Internet employees often offer what they want, and so it is a question to take or leave.
Leaders almost always receive huge fees, and the editor can earn even ten thousand dollars a month outside the pension and insurance payment.
As far as permitted is concerned, the argument is complicated: the number of days after the first year, the number of days after the third year until the 15 days after the number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own knowledge, are often sick during the course of one year.
It's just a question of climate.
UNIPOL: SOUD IN ROME, DANILA COUPOL STATE IN GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Criminal Senate of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinauda, decided to refuse to introduce an entrepreneur with the realities of Daniel Coppoly, who requested that he move from his city, Grottaferrats, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the anti-sale sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process on its own costs, he received a release last week from the domestic prison, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrat.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the business with reality could change the place of stay from the rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (which was expressed as pm) would allow him to influence his company and to obtain evidence that he was accused of.
Elity in Danger
This event occurred a few days ago, when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the saving plan to provide $700 billion to the White House: much of the Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which inform us that the current crisis is spreading to the Republican side, continuously more divided among its old East Coast soul, a smaller, closer to the federal institutions and to the business community, and its new soul, which is rather conservative, hostile to "the Washington" and to the world of finance, strong in the states in the middle and south.
The soul that was arrogantly manifested by the vote that I was talking about at the beginning...
However, this just quoted thing is just an example of changes, major changes that the current economic downturn already shows: not only in the United States, but in the whole West and perhaps not just here.
Both in Usa and in Europe, it seems that this crisis is acting as an accelerator of events that have been incubated for a long time, which inflame into the new climate and finally come to light.
The first of these is the revitalisation, the extraordinary revitalisation of the market, the dual category of State-power in relation to a certain renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis for banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong foreign flows, but in which the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one country, are mainly covered.
This created a political problem for those who run it at the same time: it means how to respond to the problems and protests of people and families who are not members of the electorate.
The short-term crisis appears to be economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
The political internationality seems to be largely out of play or to have nothing to add: the obvious evidence gave to the European Union, which is always divided as between different interests and a different state strategy and which cannot be decided on for one common policy line.
And so everyone is waiting for the government's intervention of each state, saving plans, revitalizing the market, new rules and especially the distribution of funds: when we get to the pressure, only the states have economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to make things right.
And also their own necessary means and powers so that they can be used: two sources of irreplaceable values, under certain circumstances, in which no market and no international organisation will ever be able to have a similar share.
This new emphasis, which the crisis puts on a state-national element, is still in full line with the growing importance that is being sought by the last economic progress to be attributed to one factor closely linked to it: territorial competence.
Paradoxly, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the Kingdom of the Network, ever more sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that the world's finances had already been determined to rule the world, we realized nothing of anything that our future would have to face ever more and more immaterial things such as water, livestock, oil.
All the things that he would say can be moved from one place to another on the ground, however, are in any case connected, absolutely, to restricted space, territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler has a lot more cards in his hand than he does, and who has the shame of living in a place without grain, without oil, and without water.
I'm getting to the second newspaper that predicts a break.
Who is talking about territory, the state, the government, is talking inevitably about politics, that is, about leadership.
In view of the economic crisis, it seems that two convergence phenomena are emerging.
On the one hand, it is aware that there is an objective need for authoritarian leadership, an application for someone who can understand the situation.
On the other hand, there is a discreditability towards existing leadership, in particular economics, which has proved to be equally inadequate and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and in a sense disturbing: discreditability, impatience, feeling inability and inability that is trying to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems, however, that even more widespread in the broad masses of the population is the belief that their actions are the same as the thoughts of the popular elites so far, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already exceeded its time and is distasteful to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership is short-lived from the ground, but a strong movement for the elimination of ruling classes and traditional political arrangements is reflected in the unexpected elections of the "distortions" or unexpected changes in collective instruments in the last and most recent period, from the conservative entry into Austria-Bavorska to the fall of the Labourers in Britain, to the support of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the triumph of the right in Italy).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their formats, have more and more problems to understand, so to represent, which, not from today, is created in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is reinvigorating, growing, potentially overcoming the cloum.
Before this, it would be too late to talk about a permanent "mass resistance".
But we certainly can't say that it means having open eyes.
Super adhesive to walk around the walls
To overcome the laws of gravity through super glue and in the future walk through walls like Spiderman.
This is an object of various U.S. research centres and is now very close to the team of four institutes.
Scientists have managed to keep the stochylogram body glued to the vertical wall using labels of just 2.5 centimeters square.
STUDIUM – American magazine Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, in Akron, the Georgian Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material that has been invented by the team of researchers is the development of existing materials that use a specific structure of carbon called carbon tube tubes.
"The base of the glue can be represented as a series of tubes set up as an organized spaghetti heap," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the feet of a gekon, covered by microscopic chappies, which allow animals to ensure a perfect landing.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, showed that the new glue is ten times stronger than the knives of these beaches and at the same time "it is easier to slip away from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at Dayton University.
-"This material could be useful as a provisional adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Hopefully, but researchers are thinking of far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because the carbon pipe is a heat and electricity guide.
Other applications could relate to aviation space engineering .
For the time being, no superhero.
Further research – The University of Berkley, California, is also dedicated to researching a new adhesive.
In an article in American Chemical Society magazine, California scientists introduced a adhesive made of micro fibres as hair that is clean from dust by moving around the surface to keep perfect fit.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.
Attention to the grep, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks that are consumed mainly in summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some life-saving medicines, their use changes to enhance or reduce their effectiveness with serious health effects.
To make David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, highlight the risks of both ready and fresh in combination with the use of some medicines, at the just 263th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, there is a new blow: just one bottle of grape, orange and apple juice to reduce the intake of some life-saving drugs, to cancel their beneficial effects and to expose patients’ health.
The flu jus has already been accused of being responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs to the toxic level.
RISK- The Italian medical agency itself announced this in the information bulletin two years ago and expelled doctors and patients so as not to underestimate the dangers arising from this medicine and to pay attention to what they drink in the event of taking medicines such as Diazepam or methadone.
NEW GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juices also contain substances that kill drugs.
A long list of effects of grapefruit and other juices.
From this point of view, Michele Carruba, director of the Pharmacovigilance Department of the State University of Milan, says: "These findings are most immediately reported to the most diverse international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which may establish and exchange information instructions on drugs.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines you get and if you encounter something unclear, do not be upset, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for an explanation» stressed the expert for Ansa.
Nobel Prize for the Economy of Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and location of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenyan who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important criticisms of Bush's administrative, foreign, economic and political steps.
A few months after the September 2001 assassinations, on the days of Enron's execution, Krugman predicted in a comment issued in the New York Times that the second event would be, in terms of the consequences in the history of the United States, much more important than the first.
The prediction that caused a slight controversy that had been calculated after years, however, proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and shocked at how fast the collapses like Enron and Worldcom disappeared from public interest," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Binho Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is "an economy of great importance", but also a popularist who has "very aggressive style, particularly critical of Bush's liberalist administration's excess".
Open Office, we have the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It's Open Office.org 3.0 issue day, an open source package of personal products that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more familiar Microsoft Office.
After about the annual work of volunteers controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows wide audiences with different news: to the welcome screen and to the revised and improved opening window are added further, far more essential, as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format 1.2, the latest standard version of ISO.
The focus is also on cooperation with the Office 2007, Open Office is able to open the document even with the new Microsoft application (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
The special features of some models are interesting, such as what allows to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the possibility to transfer the PDF file to the graphic execution model and to preserve the original view of the page.
From this point of view, we can still create "PDF hybrids" documents that resemble typical Adobe format graphics and have properties of the table processor or text program.
Cooperation is an element that has achieved many improvements within application programmes: it is excellent to work together between different users and avoid conflicts of change, in the text programme, each collaborator is assigned one color to comments in order to be clearer identification in the audit phase.
Some companies are also working on transferring some of the Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the following weeks the final outcome should be postponed.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, was added to the English version which is on the mirror since Friday.
Besides Windows and Mac OS, the package is usually also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation cd may also be sent home or to the workplace on request.
And if the free theme can be an extension to households, the Open Office package is very much in business, and can already be counted with the various projects carried out in public administration and in schools.
And there is no shortage of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacement Word; Calc is a table processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for presentation similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows to work on databases; Draw, at last, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5th million downloads, and when we consider that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this expected number can be overcome.
Also the results of Kohl are positive, it's the fourth case of doping
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: it's about Rakušan Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third-class winner and the best rider's shirt.
The report quoted L'Equipe's website.
26th year Kohl is the fourth positive racer on Cera, the third generation Epo, after italccard Ricco and Leonard Piepoli and the Germans Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl’s blood samples are among those carried out in the last few weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If control analyses confirm the positive on Cera, Rakušan loses third place on Tour and will have to face two years of disqualification.
The report on the positive side of Kohl in the third generation confirms the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordy, who announced the Associated Press that he has already informed the outcome of the Austrian government.
The 26th year of Rakušan was placed on the stage winners after Spanish Carlos Sastrem and American Cadel Evansema, also won a scored trick of the best rider.
IMGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES IS RESEARCHING, IS ITALIAN RAISIST?
Italy "as the country of immigrants only turned into the last house for the priority of immigrants" adopted with resistance.
Is this a beautiful country for the racist nation? So it is in a long article in the New York Times that devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, because he stole a box of droughts.
This case illustrates what the New York Times define as "north paradox": the northern areas are at the same time those where "more integration and more work is registered", but also "the strongest anti-circumvention thinking in the country and the strongest support of the North League".
To confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parmy, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by Lego, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitates the removal of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
The trend highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the church to work together to defeat racism".
Students for expensive rent - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students doesn't know the crisis.
According to Sunia's latest research, rental committees, a single room can be rented in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"Ev has already achieved such dimensions that the whole class of students have lost the right to study due to a total of too high prices that their families would have to suffer – explains the leading office for Sunia, Laura Mariani – in this city a large demand from the students has deformed the market in such a way that it has stimulated the process of rising prices that has also expanded on residences."
In most cases, rental offers contain several offences: contracts in a free way, unregistered, without limited rent, linked to the leases.
For Sunji, an exceptional effort is needed to regulate prices through the tax revision.
If we look at the research details, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, there is a need for a single bed of about 450 euros, for a single room the minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) is above the average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) up to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria zone).
In Florence there is one bed on average EUR 350/400, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the university, €250/280 is needed for a double room bed, from 370 to 500 in a single bed.
In Rome, in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double room.
Values are slightly lower (EUR 550 per single year) in areas close to other universities (Ostenses and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: EUR 300 per bed and 450 per single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples, there is a bed of EUR 300/450, a room of EUR 400 to 600, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari they want for bed 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are certainly lower, but they have greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where the most frequent event for students from countries outside the European Union is finally another anomaly: an increase of around 25-30% of the fee they want for foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old movie Paradiso, cities ruin historical halls
The cinematographic historical halls are closed in favor of multiplex.
"The city without a movie is like a blind, like a face without an eye."
The picture offered by director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian city centres, but also in rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the birth of large multi-stations in the suburbs and the subsequent collapse of mono-stations in the central areas of the cities is one of the events that seem to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of a genuine cultural crime.
Often the historical places filled with memories "is like a friend, a well-known person with whom we shared a piece of travel and a lot of emotion," feels director of New Paradise, a film that won Tournator Oscar 20 years ago and a grand jury award in Cannes, who told the poetry of a village cinema and the grief of a way of life that almost lost the cinema forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of the traditional type have been closed, and the highest account has been paid primarily to rooms in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions the most affected closures are Emilia-Romagna, with the loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first responsible for their radiation is the approach to multiplex, these three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinemas: 195 paid more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian procedure has developed in a nationwide way," says Paolo Protti, president Anec, "is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to ensure that those already existing survive, because when one movie closes the city, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let's not even talk about insufficient funding for operators: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
In support of the sector, between EUR 16 and EUR 18 million per year would be needed."
An interesting case is the Bolognan case, the first Italian city that is concerned with the closures and which decided to find the eastern sign of the protocol between the municipalities and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historical centres and in the suburbs.
The planned standards include steps to tax benefits for operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: the spectators will be able to travel to the restricted transport zone and will have special prices for stopping and in some parking lots.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna's introduction of other measures."
However, it is certain that in order to be able to face the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The protection of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: the closure of Super cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was a spark that convinced me to set up "New Paradise cinema", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I've been in front of the government or Quirinals in the National Street, where I've shared so much emotion that I don't have to look at the letters of black work, I'm turning to the other side."
Link between politics and mafian group 'andranget, Mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The old man of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the elections of the city authority according to the interests of the Mafia group Piromelli."
The charges against the Mafia Directorate in Calabria against the mayor and the mayor of Gioie Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carl Martelli, who was arrested this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are difficult.
In the railways too, Gioacchino Piromelli, an old mediator between the clan and public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, the name of the chief, already accused of committing mafia crimes, sentenced to EUR 10 million.
"All legal and moral standards, as well as sound minds, were ignored," state representatives wrote, when two local authorities expressed a desire to pay counsel Piromallim's consultation.
"This would allow the Mafia groups – the judges write – to officially enter the city's authorities and thus strengthen the scope of the control and management of public administration."
The President of the Agazio Loiero Regional Commission of California does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organised criminal sub-worlds are many in his country: "There are areas where the focus of mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have a lot of local policies that deal with the pressures of 'andrangets, heroes that are still undecided."
The arrests from this morning followed the arrests from July last year , by which the police showed that the Mafian group of Pyromalli received a final strike .
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioioi Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, for example, the alleged link between organised crime and local administration - has been a failure of local policies to function in general administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, President of Christian Democrats, who was elected at the time of the dissolution by the head of the right Wednesday coalition after a narrow election in May.
He screamed about the scandal when Prefecture ordered the General Council to be dissolved.
He called for the responsibility of the then Deputy Minister of Interior Marc Minniti and accused him of making everything sound for political reasons, but the judge in the prison regulation signed this morning explained that the Mafia Group had reached even so far that she requested a change to the A3 Road Project.
From other inquiries made to Dal Torrionov, public prosecutors wrote, "the desire to move the demands of entrepreneurs, representatives of some larger groups are as close as is generally known to Piromellim and adapt the public administration's choices to the interests of the mafia group."
When the energy comes from the waves, they get into your big game.
It is an infinite layer that covers more than 70% of the earth's surface and is now being discovered by large world energy companies.
Waves, currents, flow, flow are new sources of inexplicable energy, on which the air of wheels like Chevron is now trying to raise hands on these sources.
The possibility of creating energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When oil prices fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went side by side, but now organic organizations and the new increase in oil prices gave the sector new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 announced that about 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of the wave of the sea.
This quantity would be a double amount of energy that is currently produced in nuclear centres.
In addition, there are currents and flow and flow.
The giants are attacking.
The company that planted the marine energy was Enersis, who agreed in 2005 to set up the facility in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it seemed to be a huge revolutionary step.
After two years, which is based on marine energy, there are still more companies that are based on marine energy than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – he spoke to one company that is connected to the oil chain of the United States, in the economic daily Wall Street Journal – and is thinking about the possibility of working with us."
The cooperation we consider is about obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of the project for the use of marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially when we take into account that the oil is still on the way to Alaska, and recently President Bush has come up with a plan for a new return.
In addition to Chevron, they monitor the trace of sea energy i Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and even the amounts invested, even though they are not known in detail, they show an increasing interest among observers.
Technology, Keru needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology that's still at the beginning, because they don't know how it's going to affect the use of marine energy in the environment.
Meanwhile, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and it does not seem to cause major problems to the ecosystem.
For greater energy production, however, it is necessary to use technology with greater impact on the environment.
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a color system that is connected to each other.
The force of the waves, which is moving with the battles up and down, is changed by means of cylinders and cylinders on hydraulic pressure inside these fights.
The pressure triggers the turbine that supplies energy to the generator.
Energy is delivered on the coast by submarine cables.
For the time being, in the project phase, there are four devices of this type waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could serve for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is now producing energy for the shopping centre and parking space using six pdsea turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water during flow and flow causes the rotation of turbines, which is the result of this rotational movement of the generator.
Verdant said that they have a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorization to use this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
Special interest at this point deserves the potential of acne and acne, says the Institute for Electrical Energy Research.
Although it is an unrelated factor, the flow and flow are more predictable than the wind, the sun or the wave, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
It is in the energy sector that New York, Maine and Alaska have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and predicted investment of up to 35 million dollars in 2009.
