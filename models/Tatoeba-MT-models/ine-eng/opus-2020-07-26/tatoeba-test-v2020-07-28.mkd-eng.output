It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped worrying.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look like he's studying you.
I'm walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I turn to you?
Do you like the dot?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom didn't give me enough help.
I'm not using Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We've only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them a break.
How much is it worth?
Our water was up to the goose.
Tom pretended he didn't notice that Mary was watching him.
What are you usually doing on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom lifted the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my father.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still there.
It looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
No one knows this.
The departure was delayed.
Breakfast is from seven to nine o'clock.
Tom came back last week.
They were all scared.
I've seen it before.
You made a good choice.
The nudists consider the cover to be normal.
We sat down and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
They kidnapped me.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist attitudes in public.
You know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
The wolves took away the flock.
That song has haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll be there.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
The racists are stupid.
Are you happy, Tom?
Did you shoot a gun so far?
I really like that tattoo.
Get a card for a pocket.
I don't want to surrender to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you later?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they been doing so far?
Tom's a homeless man.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for the damage.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch was guaranteed.
And meet tomorrow?
I should have known you were gonna be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did Tom ask why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom did as Mary told him.
Show us where you found him.
I never thought I'd find him.
Competition for that job is big.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he was not a good father, so he's trying to redeem himself.
Tom can't change.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have to admit something.
He had an influence on alcohol.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's a bit of a tear in his cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would say no.
I have to help him.
He's being critical.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom broke his stomach.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go to the picnic with John.
Don't be rude to me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous, we're not made of monkeys, we've got a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything special you want to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about giving up?
It's been a long night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too much of a guy for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop calling Tom off.
What could go wrong?
When am I gonna get to Boston?
Tom was eating later.
Are you helping?
Are you two relatives?
He wants an egg ham.
Just put it on my account.
I'd rather go by the subway than by the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my account.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Shall we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did You Give Up?
Mary's taking over the movie.
She's got a nice handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
I wrote Tom this report.
Are they buying like this?
It doesn't look so good.
Hey, can you give me that back?
That was personal.
I'd better go too.
Excuse me for a moment.
Take off your hat.
Acting is very good.
Please, don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
He asked me to look at him.
We'd better not get out of this storm.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you come back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He's gone.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
I'm always running my nose when I'm real.
We met several times.
Nobody liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The moon's surface is wrong.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way you can understand.
Everyone's looking for luck.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom was awfully treating me in the middle.
Tom wore a hat that was still worth it.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
There's got to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what you said in the paper.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree to that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom's been obedient, and he's even humiliated.
Where did Tom open?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're human beings.
You don't make a man with a hat.
She tried herself.
Run!
Is it paid for the delivery?
I want a tail.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy them for me?
You didn't see that, did you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
The mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been delaying this for too long.
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We're taking checks.
The paper is worth a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom's drinking a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You hit one.
The Macedonian has four Google ways: explicit, conditional, ordered and passed.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The peaceful area reflected her paintings as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're champions.
You scared Tom.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw trash on the ground.
I remember how I met the queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom seemed angry.
What will be Japan's economy next year?
That's how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How could you not sleep?
They're giving me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a lead.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our castle is big.
It's a children's game.
Tom doesn't hate you.
I'll be back in six and a half.
Tom took me to the bitch's mother.
I wasn't only an hour away.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must go on.
Make a good standing scandal.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't draw attention.
I almost passed out.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We're not losing gas.
Tom's a tramp.
Who do you have on the list?
He's got a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you took Mary's flowers?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I go with you?
Tom seems pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about is food.
Be careful not to sneak into the muddy bar.
Both of them were coughing.
The train passed through the tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you want a tennis game?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the final day they will try to escape.
Everybody's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom knows Mary from the garden.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still valid.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom, the police have already questioned him.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom left.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
Looks like you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got a Russian room.
No survivors.
She was supposed to shut up.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They're just laughing.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I've got his hooker stuck in.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do the job.
Tom doesn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king had a particularly difficult time keeping his mouth shut because of the difficult speech flaw.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
The bag's too heavy.
The timing forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels were insidious about sinking the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in prison than to escape.
I'm getting dressed.
When do you learn?
Tom had a hard time swallowing his pills.
It's worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom's pointless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by human beings.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get to it right away.
Didn't you hear me say?
Hey, take a walk.
Don't eat too much.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Get out of here.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom came forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
So you didn't want the reward?
Look at the demon.
I'm glad you're happy.
Don't be honest.
Why can't you go now?
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you're sick.
Look at the star that sanctifies.
I don't know how to help him.
Get in touch.
Make him admit it!
None of them know.
She wants short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is dead.
We broke up.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary has no courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's Tom's.
There's no ring height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.
Tom caught the ball.
Where's the nearest club?
Let them call me.
The power grid heats the ceramic plates from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll come back to me when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm getting sick of this war.
In the woods, the monkeys came down from the crescents.
Let's forget for now.
Because of his father’s sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're quick to get the data.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hi, ladies.
I'll take care of it.
I don't know.
At first, I couldn't stand it.
He's stuck in his sleeve.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he's not cold.
We're trying to help him.
They're all gone except for him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you were playing chess.
It's dark.
The pipes are closed.
I hurt you, didn't I?
Tom doesn't know how to drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
He's the one who knocked.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in the tent.
The kids cry again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom mistakenly told everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The deadline for the reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who'll help her, not you.
Most whales feed on planktons.
We need to get out of here right now.
I'm ready to do that.
The water came to my knees.
Let's make the cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm crazy.
Unfortunately, you'll have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't be so excited.
Silvia liked the concerts a lot.
Invite them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does anyone care?
How do you feel about that?
Tom was drinking from the bottle of wine.
I fell off the dot.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You mind?
When does this start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are torn apart.
Tom told Mary to donate money.
I got him with me.
Didn't your name be Cookie's old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But she's a liar.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I proposed it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel so good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with it.
Did she ask for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-phase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom's running down the hill.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Senfov's really hot.
We're advertising our products on TV.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened almost thirty years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've seen anyone try to do that before.
You were a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a kibrit?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me in the head.
Is there anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say "no"?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom was gonna panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's almost got to go.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
They blocked him.
Tom's getting sick.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, he didn't get what he was hoping for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it so obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We were laughing at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom found me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that enough?
Tom stretched out his hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says the previous dentist told him he'd remove his nicotinic plates if he stopped smoking.
Don't expect everyone to share your opinions.
That's exactly what Tom suggested.
It kind of seems wrong to me.
Tom's a smart guy.
Carito in the right is a mixture of more spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
This was a hard night for me.
Tom was driving through town with an uplifted brake without noticing.
Yeah, anyway.
You want a camping trip?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to turn Mary out of the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom seems suspicious.
Keep it to yourself.
You got it now, don't you?
I'm pretty excited.
I'm not employed.
My old English teacher must now be turning into a grave.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, not realizing that their own conduct is undesirable.
He's wearing high heels to make him taller.
Do you want some bowling?
I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't cry.
I'm here with Tom.
Tom was totally humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What's it got to do with that?
We're finally getting together, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house is not big enough for our family.
He gave up the idea.
I must sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
How much do you think you're doing?
Did someone hit Tom?
We have a rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
The day was so nice that we decided to plan.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used incoherent expressions.
Your coffee's powering!
Tom was a nice man.
It's a big meraklia for football.
Why did you ask me about that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the darkness.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works in NASA.
Tom writes it.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom writes his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They've got to get rid of the idea.
Tom's really upset.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all experience her behavior as negative.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Get away from her.
His eyes lit up with anger.
Why were you shouting?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom refused to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can do anything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You gave me a word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready.
I want you to keep your promise.
I can see that no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "So do I."
There are many birds in the forest.
Please let me stay.
Come on, walk.
He just wanted to meet Tom.
You need to ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible Tom was richer than we thought.
I never meant to cheat on you.
What the hell was all that for?
I don't have such a wish.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your soy.
I'm sorry.
I can't find the hotel address.
Smoking means suicide.
The hard shells, the peppers and the peppers are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to bring you this as soon as possible.
What's your hat?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom's wearing his knees.
Where do the pinions come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of skin.
I have to rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom did, and the crowd was picking up.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very well, but he didn't make it.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink gassed drinks.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost got a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Bring her in.
You're cookin' an ice-cream.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going, so let's go.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan drank five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I've given up smoking abandoned.
I know how it sounds.
Tom apparently didn't stop him from sitting alone.
I already feel much better.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
It's a shame the concrete doesn't burn.
Why does Tom do this?
Tom stopped at once.
My dad brought me here when I was young.
What a bug you are.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try and find Tom.
I knew I should have kept quiet.
I'm under a threat.
Tom's here early.
He was drying his wet clothes off the fire.
She's always getting to know her English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have any blankets?
No part of the pig has fallen.
She bought some bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are beautiful.
What's going to happen next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
The cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom's packing his bags.
How does that benefit you?
That's very useful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl's been walking slowly.
Turns out you were an unexpected beauty saying.
Your prejudices have saved a lot of time.
That didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom wasn't having lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Because the note was written in French, I couldn't read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't hold on.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom smiled at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your chain.
That's not a big priority.
Take this.
How long is it now?
Do you understand?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always had everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom leaves on the ice.
I'll never capitalize.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first skull I've seen this spring.
Do you want to play?
Why did he fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems fun.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Watch out!
Linda was pregnant, and she's suspected of being pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Take me to 2:30 from the front gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll work as I know and I can.
I've got money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom's getting better.
Tom threw the gun.
They're not cocours.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a wild dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything.
The worst kind of mamuruk is the emotional mamuruk.
Let's get tough.
The bees remove the bag to collect the honey.
I need to help them.
Don't turn my back.
I'll never forget it.
Tom won the fight.
You brought them here right now.
Tom lives abroad.
They work here?
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary ran into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you help us at all?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting next to the river.
My cat's hungry.
We need some tools.
Be merciful.
That doesn't seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There's a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I haven't solved that puzzle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you do.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This isn't blue, it's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
The lambs usually kill them before they've filled one year, so they eat people.
Could you get that gun out of my leg?
I've forgotten how smart you are.
Can I see her?
He spends his money on the devil's water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not quite sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times that you shouldn't be too big.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
It's a hard book.
Why do we have to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom's been lying to me all the time.
The rooms in the hotel are obviously very bad, and I'm hearing him in the next room chewing gum!
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's walk through the market!
Try to be an optimist.
Well, obviously you have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the key.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you kidding me?
Please, talk to me.
The angels keep us and lead us.
Why doesn't Tom help us?
The therapy didn't help.
My grammar is weak.
Tom was available.
Tom's going to town.
I'm interested in Japanese culture.
This is a call.
Who saw me.
Tom's getting closer.
Tom is the real hero.
Where did he come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
It's done.
These hairs are burning.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't even think about trying to convince Mary to do it for a second.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I didn't play Monopol from college.
Tom closed his locker.
Maybe we're relatives.
It's my fault I didn't call you.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why are you asking?
It's not back.
Tom's fast asleep.
Be smart and don't tell your people about it!
She was standing in front of her.
There are more exits.
Tom's always been so protective of the kids.
I asked the same question.
We had to find a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
You gave me six lazy shirts.
I'm safe.
The wires look weird to you.
That's why I can't help you.
I have not yet found the time to write that report.
I can do it without it.
There are also those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
She's dressed.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't have been prevented.
I want to walk by the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom's blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get down.
We need to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom's gone.
I can't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm thirty years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Do you know what you're doing?
I've got a lot of money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use the dream.
What about the sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Hand over the compositions.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was bloodthirsty.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
This afternoon, we're gonna eat peanuts from Italy.
And Tom's from Boston.
It's a cruel bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I wasn't there for three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need sun cream.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unfriendly.
Tonight is right for me.
They were traveling east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is a source of life.
The tires that fell from the roof split.
Who owns this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped clean the cadre.
Come on, come on, come on.
Tom would throw us out.
Tom's not ashamed.
I'm just finishing the report.
Come on, hurry up!
You better go.
Tom knocked out the exit.
I've got two cameras.
What did you find?
Dan admitted to Linda that she was a heavy drinker.
That's Tom's drawing.
The game isn't over.
Tom put his drink down.
They stole my wallet on the bus.
Don't fight me.
I guess it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not here for you.
Did someone hurt you?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
I was paid to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary shout.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The amebules are alive.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't have to mean Tom's dead.
The dams create the wind.
Take a clear glass of the poster.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left a message.
That's all you've seen?
That would be a disaster.
I like the way the French write their word for "bummar."
The trigger can start 20 tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's risky without any help.
Is that what you want?
We're pretty good.
The pig is cut to pieces and crushed.
Ask the expert face.
I love travel.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
It was hard for Tom to deal with Mary.
Tom was apparently trying to convince Mary to take over something.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of kind.
Tom wipes his forehead.
The book is not yet translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters forced a huge amount of money from the rich man.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
They bite your conscience, don't they?
I wanted blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom's got that scar on his beard?
Tom had a bruise on his hand.
Take the scarf, your nose's running.
Tom was going with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
First of all, they were farmers.
You just need to trust me.
I just don't want you to do something you're gonna regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely leaves.
We set up a tent.
I didn't think he'd be back last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
Camoli would have stayed.
She has ten children.
Tom threatened me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
Now I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still dressed in pajamas and bathrobe when I came this morning.
We've all read that.
Get over here.
You're in the back.
The sentence is not exactly grammatical.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Do you have any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary’s first teacher.
In the middle of town there's a fountain.
You have to help her.
The reader will soon realize that my analysis is accurate and that its results are more reliable.
I've tried.
A broken tree prevented the road.
Don't interrupt Tom.
There were no more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my attempts have failed.
Math's the best way to go.
They were so happy together.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
You put your head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't like it.
Did you see the grapes this morning?
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom wants to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Ellis.
You hurt me and you called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were passengers.
I think Tom's being subtle.
Some fish know how to change their sex.
I can take it from her.
Get some food.
Maybe it'll be hard.
I don't curse their kids.
You have to help him.
I thought you might be able to help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do that.
It makes us work too hard.
Slow down.
He wants every wedding to be the bride and the deceased at every funeral.
Tom's probably okay.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised when he saw Mary and John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They're offering free condoms.
Wet climate conditions are not the property of the peninsula.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom's never there.
Please take care of yourself.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom took out the pen.
Why should I be interested in what you're doing?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a musical box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Shall we arrest Tom?
How long should this medicine be taken?
I don't need a bed.
Put us on Facebook!
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are truly happy do not record their happiness.
I still don’t know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please show me more.
I need to make my own house.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I teach him English.
What's usually the cause of the pain?
We're dependent on work.
This box is made of kalai.
She dropped the test for a reason.
Trust her in your intuition.
He can't do that.
You didn't listen.
Tom's evil.
Try not to pay attention to Tom.
Mix all the ingredients in the garden.
There was a lot of sperm.
Tom's very boring.
I've been vaccinated against flu.
Just try it.
I want to dance, too.
Tom was a piano teacher.
Tom was the only one.
Is Tom interested?
Here it is.
I'd like to have a talk with you about Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never been a surfer.
I'll find something.
We ate corn soup.
We can work on the open, if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's treasures.
That cake is caloric.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I blame Tom.
We'll be able to sit down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
They told me you know how to do this.
You're experienced.
What's wrong with her?
It's not usually a pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom seemed torn apart.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I've got a car.
I'm not a wimp.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the weirdest prisoners I've ever seen.
This is where I spend most of my day.
Should we wait here?
If you get out so wide, you'll get it.
Does it still hurt?
It was pretty funny.
I set it up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did you say anything to Tom?
Are they all busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom was wounded.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We were making a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Give me the wine.
All stores are closed.
You made white again!
Stop smacking the dick.
Tom's done with the gardens.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
No need for drama.
We believe in God.
We need to take whatever we need to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom agree with his colleagues?
That smells like a cough.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you some advice.
No matter what you do, always give your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report rape.
Tom's a responsible adult.
I can't call them home.
You're a racist.
I already forgave you.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow I still don't believe it.
What's a shortcut from?
Thank you again for coming.
We're being cheated.
The wounded soldier barely left.
The sun just rose.
I actually know the answer to that question.
Why don't you shut me up?
What prevents Tom from doing it again?
Tom's doing movies a lot.
I was beautiful.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
The light turns away from the water.
Tom's pushing the soup.
I'm not kicking you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom examined the objects on the table.
The police threw Dan in jail.
Go back to your seats.
Can I touch you?
You miss something?
Let a man sit down and cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We went between the trees.
Anyway, I'll do it.
I knew you'd be standing on Tom's side.
They couldn't escape.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
It's my fault I didn't call them.
Pray to God, not to his prophets.
Tom was acting like a knight.
Now we're even with him.
We're walking to school together.
You're so talented.
I need to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch in the afternoon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been more cultural.
Have fun with Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
You've been sucking your guts.
I'm sorry, but my answer is denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is not to give a gift to Tom.
Tom was working.
Tom lived right next to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She's got a short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to learn.
He's down the hill.
Can I make something up?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'll go with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's take a look.
The European wants to drink wine.
My husband's a good man.
He has a lot of debts.
She knows the most important cities.
What's under the roof?
Nobody wants to play with her.
Tom to all their drinking tours.
Are you ready to go?
Tom's obviously out of his mind.
Tom came to them.
You think you can cheat on me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
It can't be him.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her ligature.
The teacher's teaching.
I wasn't here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not good enough.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they scared?
I'm wearing my passport.
It was a masterpiece they talked about a lot.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she'll be back.
I don't have any pens.
When should we start worrying?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom wants vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship was sinking.
Did you buy the cure?
Did Tom drink?
It hurts my work.
The question is who will do that.
I'm leaving for Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Are they all happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's pissing me off.
That's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would like to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please, ask me what it is.
Hey, what's up now?
I'm not ashamed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom's a wunderkind.
That foot goes to school.
It's starting to get in our head that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very clever.
Now the question is, what should we do?
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
End up in the fourth place of 56 runners.
Don't cry.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a child, he was obsessed with the girl who lived on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
Sounds very good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom poisoned Mary's silence.
They'll be there soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my rooms.
They weren't acting fast.
I'm weak.
You're playing a waving sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever unless someone kills them.
I don't want to hang out with Tom.
They'll never take you to that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is Tom looking for them?
Here's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't called.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
These animals are under threat.
Tom made a proposal.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the door open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned around to see her.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has enormous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so excited tonight?
Tom's down the drains.
We're getting too big.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for a reward.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes get angry, and they get better as soon as he drinks a couple of beer.
You have merciful eyes.
You don't understand business.
Is this your bag or hiss?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
If so, it will be repaired... when the worm gives birth to grapes.
Tom's a counselor.
Can I talk to you?
You hurt me by calling me an ass.
Since when did he have a fire?
It's possible Tom was lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing as you.
I didn't betray anything.
I thought you were yesterday.
I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It's impossible for him to quit smoking.
My hair's falling.
The big question that no one has found the answer, including me and me, despite thirty years of research on the woman's soul, is "What do women want?"
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
The villagers reap harvest.
Tom won't like it.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the breach?
I can work wherever I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've been looking everywhere.
What was it?
In each section, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Is it over your head from me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was furious.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer knows how to scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe it?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that picture is.
Everybody's up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Good luck with you!
The concert ended with the folk hymn.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not moving.
Wait a second.
I've got something to do with it.
Your propaganda isn't interesting.
He was running as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I don't have a comment.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's a sum of enough air here.
She married a man of zeros.
The wind's out.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to wear anything dirty.
The old man died before he died.
I don't like this book.
Luckily, I hit him.
What would Tom be looking for?
The sun is a star between billions of others.
I've got some spasms.
Can someone help me?
We're leaving this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do this.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you ask Google?
It's not yet spring.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't mind me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
This mystery is solved.
Tom was hospitalized.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in the park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, here's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I got.
Are you sure we shouldn't order first?
One who can hear the butterfly laughs knows and how the clouds taste.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom's going to surrender.
Just find them.
I can't go out with them.
They pulled a hole to see who's going first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar's not to eat like goods!
But if I were in Brazil, I'd be much more afraid.
Did you work as a bartender so far?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it at all.
I've just finished my work time.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have a flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food is cold, warm it in a microwave oven.
The stream's right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money she had saved.
I think it's time you left now.
The guy's a bandit.
It's possible Tom saw it.
Tom's a bit of a bitch.
Tom's very unsuspecting.
What'd they do?
How's the cylinder wheel?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's got a drink.
I like your company.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom put a fork in the drawer.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks it's too cool for me.
The whales are a kind of titty.
Dan killed Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I fully understand.
Tom seems shocked.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat in that restaurant.
He's getting ready to go back.
This will make our work much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would I get out of here?
You took over the business.
You don't even want fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not returned.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral marches.
We're probably lying.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me, so I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this.
Swallow your hands.
I can't believe we actually did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
That's exactly what I'm worried about.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family, just like myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a bunch of questions.
Who's handling things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I'd never accept it.
It's gonna get cooler.
What are you drinking?
The way it came - the way it went.
His legs were in the morning.
Tom left his keys.
It all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want new accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me the location on the map?
Tom's inconspicuous.
What's your question?
Tom went to the jungle.
Look forward.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Are you angry, Tom?
This is my newest turn.
I haven't been good for two days.
It's a wormhole.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know the difference between the brain and the donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
The rain coming out doesn't come to mind.
I'll tell them to go now.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I've got a sense of humor.
There was no living soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you in a long time, guys.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Do you want to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was shooting Mary with a fucking egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take it.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes any sense.
I set them up.
What are some of the symptoms of chewing gums?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I want to watch porn with lesbians.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John writes his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that keyboard chord?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom's worried right away.
I have no feelings for her.
I guess I was expecting a little better.
I already believe it.
She writes a letter to her mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom was acting like he was surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to cross the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was late.
We want to know about them.
Have a good time.
The old house has some charm.
This is a taboo theme.
We barely saved ourselves.
Did they hire you?
It's raining.
Tom could see Mary texting.
You'll be better off.
Tom was a little confused.
Let's do this right.
You can cross Hawaii for a whole year.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most believe that computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Brother, you can't just come over to a woman and scratch her-- it's called sexual abuse.
I decided to tell her I love him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm the first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We've wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sitting down.
You can't do what's gonna happen to you.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
He was breathing a lot.
I'm a patient man.
It's not happening here.
Better to be optimistic and lie than to be pessimistic and right.
The water was milk.
I'm waiting for the traffic light to change.
The boy was silent.
The ship's body is divided into several watertight parts.
Because of what you were cooking, I'm gonna wash the dishes.
Let's leave the subject.
Tom knows something that doesn't tell us.
When are you going home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your condition.
There's fake moves.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the trumpet?
I won't wait for them.
You don't have to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Oh no!"
He's no longer that shy boy what he was.
You got it?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were boys all over the world divided into groups, some playing twins, some tiles, some with a ball, others driving a dot or riding wooden horses.
Suspects destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk in the bottle yet.
We both have to go.
The pain that causes love is a message of pleasure.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You have to go home.
Come on over here.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We'll find her.
You misjudged her.
Wait till I check the manual.
The energy comes from inside.
No one trusts them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
You've got your head on.
We're in.
Give it back to the seat.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want to get my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom's growing up.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how that happened there.
I'm not satisfied.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please, keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm mad.
It's less wet than yesterday.
It's hard for me to make new friends.
It's strange how people in the tropical zones eat spicy food like cari.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you gonna do anything?
Tom had no family.
I can't determine what the baby wants, because it's pointing to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Although he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom caught a terrible bite.
I'm raising orchids in my glass.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go get Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old church in the garden.
Jim was never abroad.
I turned off the TV.
That's a fake lead.
Tom was fighting.
I said maybe he'll come back.
I need you to open my door.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like that happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
You know how to fix things?
Go ahead.
I forgot his address.
You're in lunch?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Her bottom has a sleigh on one side.
Let's be late for something.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing well.
She can neither read nor write.
You hurt Tom's leg.
Get in there.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very nice lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail by then.
The most expensive thing is the country.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom, you've made a list of the things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
It's sour.
We lost food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why are you opposed?
I'm sorry, I don't have a prayer.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy the temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That'd probably be a problem.
Figure out how much money we're gonna need next year.
I burned a kibrite in the dark.
How much does she do there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you getting up at six o'clock?
Tom sat down again.
Which country is Boston?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of a computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I was burning my lungs, I was just standing in my room waiting to recover.
Don't thank me yet.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom was playing on the piano.
I'm clean.
I ate a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard exactly.
Tom's got a headache.
Oh, no.
There's nobody here.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
He did all he could.
He's a lacquer.
First, let's talk about what Tom should do.
My mom's buying a toy.
That's not how I risk it.
This house needs repairs.
I'm impressed, Tom.
Tom's a run.
Tom doesn't listen.
They love everything you told them you'd give them.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many respects, women and men are quite different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the matter?
Is that necessary?
Tom's staying.
I'll never love you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well's dried.
I thought I'd ask for their help.
Maybe you should call them.
Some people don't like it.
In line with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What's this got to do?
Is your dog barking?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German doughnuts.
At the time, we were 18 years old.
I make thirteen bucks an hour.
It's dangerous to go through that desert.
I want broccoli, but I hate carophilia.
I'm upset when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom's gone.
Go on with it.
This is negative.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he doesn't know what Mary wants to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
Is Tom hurt?
They drank you.
Tom started to complain.
I think you should pick her.
He's getting along.
You're great.
Tom's lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out the candles and imagine your wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom cruelly looked at Mary.
Tom was wearing a duxer.
Tom seems decisive.
I'm glad she didn't call.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready?
How long has it been?
They're not burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see it, as a chance.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joke.
It was a lot worse for me.
Tom's moving to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I've only had one glass.
No one's writing to me.
Tom broke his heart.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm asking.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to speak with his mouth.
They've all been under control.
Every customer has his own rights.
I only call you as much as I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they looked at me.
I know Tom's address.
What'd you do last?
We won.
Tom says he was never sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I'm going to the market because the car's broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
They chose us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom's not invited to parties often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom's not quite a threat.
It was midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change the shampoo?
Tom was looking around, he was expecting something to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
It's hot here, you can take off your coat.
I don't think they followed me.
They don't have a defense.
He often helps others.
Tom's a big pessimist.
You have the right to a phone call.
The skiing was actually much more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get that guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remember their debts.
I don't want to get in.
Their friendship grew rapidly in love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned the lamp on.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the form.
I don't imagine this party like that, but whatever you want.
Do you think Tom would like to go with us?
Yoga comes from India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom's slamming his toast with butter.
We have work to do.
I've heard him smack.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives there on the edge.
I'll accept anything.
It won't be okay.
Dan never meant to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It'll be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is a misconception of the question.
Tom was obviously used to such problems.
You'll be all right.
It was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I made some coffee on the muses.
He rarely went there.
Tom's all right.
Let's sing and dance.
After the war, the winners are always right, and the defeated are the guilty.
Tom and Mary's doll presents.
The translation of jokes is quite difficult, if it can be said to be possible at all.
This was a wee day.
I'm carrying bad news.
This doesn't help.
Overcoming weakness.
How many cracks do you make every day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Don't you have a random key?
Let's be realistic.
Tea with lemon, please.
Tom's got nothing to do with it.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was drinking.
Tom's gone.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little bet.
I'll make sure we finish this project in time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You're too tight when you shake.
What if we don't find them?
Don't let me come get you, Tom.
Take the first place at the game.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan was smoking marijuana with Linda.
Tom often walks by before dinner.
She stayed until yesterday late.
You're upset.
Everybody shut up.
What exactly happened between us?
What's wrong?
He gave up the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
Maybe it's weird.
No one can save himself from death.
It won't help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom was in trouble many times so far.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you back here in Boston.
Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
We're very happy.
Is that all we need?
He was desperate for health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom's got an earache.
Day hit him with a hammer on his forehead.
Who gave you that idea?
What did Tom do?
You're in the middle of the night.
It's not the right time now.
You don't have any alcohol anymore.
When are you going?
I'd like to buy my coffee.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
I got this song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What's Tom's intention?
Your mother's advice would be superior to your friend's.
We have not yet been saved from danger.
Tom's getting mad.
He's been waiting ten minutes.
She was wearing a helmet.
Dan's looking for the police now.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him there.
Monday is the first day, Tuesday the second, and so on.
They're moving fast.
I need to see Tom right away.
Tom's waiting for you in the conference room.
What was she up to?
My ancestors are from Germany.
Tom cut the tape.
I've done it.
I want to hear Tom's stories.

I'll see you later.

You're hurting me.
I'll pay for what I need.
I haven't been happy since Tom left.

Stop yelling, my head hurts.
You won't command me, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a beautiful sight!
Tom has a plan for everything.
Don't worry.
Tom needs to relax.
I'm jealous of Tom.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'll get stronger.
This elephant is loved by young children.
Thank you very much, Tom.
This is hard for her.
Mary put on her shirt.
She's got a picture.
It's a lot of swimming.
The flowers come in.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise.
This is very nervous.
We need more U.S. slang on Tatoeba, immediately!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom's gonna get scared and give up.
Is this place free?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don’t thank me yet.
I want tea.
I wouldn't want to come in.
Nobody wants to sit with you?
It'd really be nice to shut up.
Tom decided that Mary had a bad influence.
Where's your gun?
Tom wants to do it.
It wasn't easy for us.
I was a passenger.
I'll fly from school.
I've often heard him play the trumpet melody.
Unsatisfied libido is what makes all art and literature.
This is really hard for them.
Tom's crazy.
I think Tom will be here in time.
Hold on to the plan.
If you're hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
She's complicated.
Check if the plane is off.
Would you like to take part in this event?
There's almost no left coffee in the cane.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written several books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I want more coffee than tea.
I didn't rush.
The mosquitoes enjoy human society.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I'm going to use it.
Can you give Tom a message?
He flirts so aggressively that women eventually run away from him.
Tom burned the curtain, by chance.
You talk to Tom?
It's hard to understand self - injury if you've never felt the need to practice it.
This will hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's night.
The pressure's rising.
Tom immediately answered Mary’s question
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom's been driving that car for three years.
Can peace be used in food?
Tom knows the way.

Tom started dreaming.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom salts his salad.
Tom's the leader.
Save Tom.
You haven't solved the problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not happy to talk about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They don't have a choice.
No one's gonna find me.
Tom's very upset.
In what situations would he use it?
Can't we start from the beginning?
Unfortunately, you're gonna have to do this without anyone else's help.
We're all in danger.
Tom won't want it.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom's exciting.

I'm giving you one last chance.
Are you dealing with some kind of sport?
Tom, meet your new granddaughter.
He's afraid of getting cancer on his lungs.
It's very cold for me.
Tom played on the piano for three hours without interrupting.
I got quality.
Did anyone find someone to keep the child safe?
I'm quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
That was an amazing experience.
Tom squeezed his voice.
Does it matter which one of these I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Are you going to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
There's nothing to say.
It'd be good.
It's coming up fast.
Tom's very upset.
That's what I said.
Tom has a butler.
Dan pulled Linda out safely.
They're my cousins.
It's 11 o'clock.

It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom must be still at school.
I never say anything, even though it upsets me.
You're below his level.
I'm worried about getting hurt.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible that Tom hired Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom this.
Tom's a lot of kids.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You need to hurry to catch the last train.
Please, open the room.
Tom is still trying to get Mary to accept the job.
How many percent of our bodies are water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very smart.
Please help me wait for Tom.
You're very smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't hold on for more than five minutes.
If the time was running out, the radioactivity was decreasing.
Should we believe that?
What'd you get so close?
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom's sitting behind Mary at the French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was baiting him in the trap.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to the chemistry, we have plastics.
What brought you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're gay.
What are you up to?
Why are you angry with me?
I can't read without glasses.
I don't mind helping.
No one did anything else.
I'm sorry I'm coming in this way.
The books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom wipes out the orchards.
That was rejected.
I'm not asleep anymore.
Tom made himself clear.
They must be worried.
I took it.
That gave me an idea.
The clock fed's broken.
I was wondering about him.
Tom says she likes Mary.
Come on, everybody, get me.
This is a good parking place.
I'm going to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
That's his job.
Camoli, if I had the camera with me.
It's gonna be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe everything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to cheat on the kid.
Did you do that to them?
I'm sure you'll be all right.
This is already a problem.
Tom Grabarms.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's get down.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me happy.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy anything to eat?
Boston is a great city.
Look at me.
How many litres of oil does he collect in the storm?
Eat slowly.
It's possible there's another world.
We have nothing you want.
It's green.
Tom regretted what he told Mary.
Go find him.
He's in the basement.
Tom's bleeding.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'll yell.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom lost his hair.
Everyone sat down.
He gently touched her.
Maybe we should turn around and come back.
I don't like walking.
Looks a little young to get married.
I hate him at school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're just getting started.
His brother is patient with him.
No one could prove anything.
What kind of hobby do you have?
So I'm serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Shall I give you a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You need to write a letter of thanks to Tom.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please, find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light's out.
Come on!
What if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wants to eat in bed.
Dan walks his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned the lamp.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's pretty close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited - everyone gets their own.
I want to believe Tom was happy.
This cloth is very stretchy when it's washed.
The truth is the goal, not the destination.
I blame him.
Did you hear about him?
Tom started talking.
I've been away for an hour.
Tom's still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without bait, it'll be hard for me to catch fish.
Tom was shaking.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces inhibitions.
Tom needs two help.
I'll tell him to go right away.
Tom seems confused.
Nobody wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
The virgins were black and deep as deaf.

He's a strict critic.
I've been treating my mother-in-law with this medicine.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball in the gym.
Give them a call.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a very good place.
I have a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim because it was cold time.
You don't have to.
I just wanted to clear up the situation.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll call you.
It doesn't get to Tom's house this time.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life away from the Himalayas.
Tom's working on it.
Please repeat.
You're very dramatic.
Tom's getting dressed.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She went to school.
They say that Maria Antoinette was responsible for the French revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's strong.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We were trying.
But it's strong!
We're like brothers.
Let me make you something.
You've got too much work to do.
Could that be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
They voted for the mayor of Boston.
The police found fingerprints of shoes at the scene of the crime.
I asked him the same thing.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom saves the letter.
Tom would like that.
She's running out of half an inch.
I said we're closed.
The question is who's going to tell him.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom must not be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come, too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that Sarkam?
Tom's a gardener.
I'm gonna have to try to deal with this myself.
They've probed the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Are you sure this isn't made of diamonds?
You let Tom escape.
What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
Dream you know.
I looked at her.
A great crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The time in April is constant.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
It's warm.
Tom was a boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut the sandwich.
Can I see you later?
Tom's legs were cold.
Boys and girls are reading.
Tom has two kids.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom ran away in the barn.
I met your girlfriend.
You're my luck.
Accept Tom's advice.
Tom left unfed food on the plate.
Tom's changing the direction.
There's no living man in the school.
The rocket flew.
We were laughing.
Tom was a little smug.
Tom's only here for a visit.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
I wish you a happy journey.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was considerate.
Tom tried to look busy, so Mary did not ask him to help her.
I eat very rarely meat.
I'm gonna go ask her.
I'm keeping his seat.
Tom couldn't help.
I'll call her later.
The flowers come in quick after you cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm wearing a bag of rice.
I can do it for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I ate late yesterday.
I just don't like it.
Plus, I can fly.
We've been spending our money.
There was hatred between them.
There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
You wouldn't want to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I have never ventured to be anything but who I am.
Sometimes it's hard to determine whether Tom's happy or not.
This doesn't warm me up.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Did you imagine a wish?
Children are sometimes afraid of the darkness.
Stay away.
I had to stay.
Tom's the only one who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked for Mary's money.
Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna catch you.
My bags are packed.
Tom's following.
Cube hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
There he is.
He crossed the street.
As long as there's life, there's hope.
I heard them snooping.
It's a shame I didn't drive with a dot here.
I need to visit Tom.
What's bothering you?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I'm not wearing provocative clothes.
This is classified.
That's not so much.
That's what you said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
I'll be damned!
I'd like to walk alone first.
How many herbs?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
It's not available.
What did you get?
I've motivated you.
I don't want to fall asleep.
I didn't see where you put your car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?
He didn't give them a chance.
He showed up all of a sudden.
I'll do as you command.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He's trading half-cars.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
You know that?
You've done the wrong thing.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's too much.
Who was the thief?
He's got charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the video doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this would get boring.
I didn't know if to get angry or laugh.
I'm mad at you.
We were waiting.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
I've always wanted a dog.
You're quite safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is, will he come visit us next month?
The puppets run them with wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you are.
The other girls put her on because of her clothes.
You're going to be confused.
I'm not following you.
Maybe Tom already did what he was supposed to do.
I'll give them another chance.
He just called me.
The failure has been suppressed.
How are you these days, Tom?
I can't stand to see him.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
She doesn't even understand me.
Beekeepers believe that genetically modified plants harm the bee’s health.
Now you can go.
They're delaying.
Tom's second year.
If I can understand, then everyone can.
Tourists weren't satisfied.
Tom's got his socks.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom pecks.
Laws are like a spider - hunting muscles, but they let the axes and the sparrows break through.
You're taller than a pawn.
When did Tom go to Boston?
You left your key on the desk, as usual.
He took off his fur jacket down, got up, and gently knocked on the door.
Tom seems so happy.
We don't look at the same subject, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
Something was Tom's.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we're all quiet.
We were looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't want tennis.
Did Tom stay long?
He's sending messages to his boyfriend.
Did anyone see Tom?
He avoided the danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to repeat that.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate.
You sound like you're relieved.
Tom's unforgettable.
Kioto is a very nice city.
This handle doesn't turn.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I'm writing my conscience.
"Why did you break my vassal?" "Love for pleasure."
We were very close.
I follow each day.
Give me your knife.
No one's defending my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked you not to interfere.
We'll have a big day tomorrow.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
It's amazing.
Wait till I'm surprised.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet?
Now he's watching TV.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
That's a coincidence.
I'm so glad I'm home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can hug me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never catch my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
I wish Camoli could be as happy as you are.
Try this sweater.
The cat put his claws in my hand.
"When did you sleep yesterday?" "At four o'clock." "What? What did you do so late?" "I spoke on the phone with the former."
How did you catch them?
No offense!
I was a little overwhelmed with another.
His heart was broken by unrelenting love.
When's it too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You're distracting me.
His rank is not high enough for that position.
Are you deaf?
I belong here.
You're my friends.
He's a professional carpenter.
Tom is not as naive as many people think.
I hit a box in his jaw.
We have two daughters and one son.
I'm going to a lunch break.
Did that man attack you?
Fill out the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Is there even that word?
You're not a Canadian.
I'm really getting married.
Everyone rejected Tom.
You can't fire him.
Ken's collecting old money.
There's a lot to say.
I hear what you're saying.
We have to face the facts.
There's no harm.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom's scaring me.
Tom's sleeping on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can call you a cab.
You're not in any danger.
What can I choose from?
We have to put them in bed.
Tom's only dish on the meat is a beer.
That's what I got close to Tom.
I don't want to derange them.
Tom was beaten.
We're really good.
She fell asleep while she was driving and caused a traffic accident.
I brought some bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?
Tom was very upset.
Why does Tom do that?
I have a job for you.
How do you form a number of names?
You saved my life.
It was too little.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
You got me a nasty smell from him.
It's improved.
This world is a valley of tears.
You don't have to be abnormal to work here.
I saw Tom.
Don't even get angry.
Tom put the gun down.
Tom's gonna have to blow up.
Get me some coffee.
You're right.
That was a fake trick.
We'll leave the theory to the mathematicians.
Where did this come from?
We're not ready.
Tom was put in jail for espionage.
Can we somehow help him?
I hope you and Tom won't be too disappointed.
These little letters are read only by a wolf.
I don't see the end.
They're gonna come looking for her.
This tooth is a chopper.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I'm not keeping my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I hear grief in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
I'd do anything to make money.
I recognize you now.
I don't want you to say something that you don't mean.
I've decorated my room.
This is just crazy!
I think I'm going to go visit Tom and see what he's like.
Stay with Tom to make his hat.
Our cabin was approaching the little island.
You won't win.
Wait a minute, I'm done with my laundry, I'm going to give it to him.
Tom was a miner.
It's all white.
I wish I had enough power to keep my diet.
The man in question is currently in America.
It's supposed to be his fault.
I'll look at Tom.
I'll be at my desk.
I'm here for the first time.
That pipe sounds very bad to me.
My eyes are tired.
I need to get away from her.
Tom makes 300,000 dollars a year.
Do I really need this?
Do you expect them?
It's a quick favor.
We had to help Tom.
That's all they're talking about.
One boy grabbed my bag while he was passing by the dot.
When was the last time he hit the baby?
I'm a little sick with my muscles.
We have experience.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'm a scratch.
They're gonna give me a break because I'm too late to work.
I thought it'd be nice to buy you a couple of bets.
Tom, what's he gonna do now?
That's the way it should be!
There's always a nice one.
Why don't you go to a doctor?
Ghost, are you there?
There's no smokers here.
Is your freezer still working?
The city restored that old, historic building.
I can't ask him to do that.
He's really proud.
Tom's back covered in mud.
It's not for you.
Tom was wondering if Mary would know what was wrong.
I don't have anything else.
Tom's at the pool with his friends.
Tom wasn't paranoid.
You're very good with kids.
I just threw it in the trash.
We just got out of there.
Tom booked a seat.
I want to use this.
What color was Tom's socks?
Tom burned my cake.
I've never been a juror before.
I've always admired Tom.
I don't like it when they touch me.
Look at the clouds.
He was so angry that his veins were jammed.
Traveling abroad is not considered.
Tom ended up as a winner.
Tom's here right now.
I'm here to apologize.
It won't be enough.
I'm hiding from Tom.
I returned home and told my wife about the work in Boston.
Tom took off and fell asleep.
And the opposite is true.
Tom's very naive.
Tom didn't want to go so early.
I'll explain later.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I'm chewing gum.
The girl playing on the piano is my sister.
I'm not sure anymore.
Don't lose hope.
Were you there?
She's wearing hooligans.
There are no missing stones.
Tom's gone to the point.
He's back at six o'clock.
The pain in dogs is proved to be higher than the pain in cats.
Be careful when you climb the stairs.
Was she with anyone?
I'm not a monster.
What's this made of?
The Butler opened the door.
Tom was wrong without a second.
Get your legs off me.
Don't say that name about me.
Are you gonna throw that?
Tom has a good profession.
They're my stuff.
Tom went for a walk every day.
The same thing happened to my friend.
I don't feel that way about you anymore.
Tom's not stupid.
Tom, change the subject.
We'll deal with this.
It's a very nice feeling.
What's Tom drinking?
I'll read this.
Give me your glasses.
I'm helping them with something.
I know about him.
We have the key.
Tom had a disastrous failure.
Just get back from vacation.
Tell your son to stop bothering my daughter.
The text's too long.
When did you come to Boston?
I'm late for something.
The caverns contain significant quantities of minerals.
Tom left them.
She's avoiding me.
Tom's back to work.
I want you to find them.
Shouldn't we wait for them?
I wouldn't like that.
I hear you're rich.
Most people are more afraid of making a mistake than of making a mistake.
This is a stupid question, but who's stronger, a lion or a tiger?
We'll have company.
We're students.
Tom pulled the rug out of the champagne.
Thank you, girl.
Tom despises your arrogance.
Don't eat live pork.
Tom made a list of places he wants to visit.
From his point of view, I concluded that he was angry with me.
I miss Boston.
The girl brought me red and white roses.
We need to ask them.
I think you know Tom.
They don't make you happy.
It's time to get to work.
Shooted three times.
I'll be sorry if I like it.
They're gratis.
Will you come back?
We can talk about it.
My daughter sings in choirs.
No more words to say.
You can make things easier.
You know my dick.
It wasn't easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
We're the best.
Now go ahead.
Tom can't help you.
Tom doesn't go to the market.
Give me a few minutes.
You can recognize your children's voices without problems.
I suggest we go home.
Tom refused to talk to me.
Tom doesn't like me.
Don't you happen to know Tom?
Tom wasn't sure if he liked the plan.
Tom's a very young man.
Tom's so stupid.
Tom wants to see it.
Tom was just part of a joke.
I'll find out who did this.
Tom hates his job.
I can make a call.
Why don't you trust me?
Tom was trying to avoid getting caught.
Have you found her yet?
Tom's alone there.
You've done your job well.
Don't be gay.
Freedom of speech is limited in certain countries.
Tom lifted his hat.
We're looking for them.
I think Tom's right.
Could you recommend a good book for me?
I'll take you home.
Does your stomach hurt?
Is Tom dead?
You're not laughing at me.
Try to get out of here.
I think I love you.
I care about all of you.
She's a little nervous about it.
You're a pig.
You're not reliable.
Tom can be trusted.
It'll be hard to convince them.
Don't be a fool now.
Did anyone see Tom?
I could use a hand with this.
I owe Tom a lot.
That was an amazing night.
The smells of jamine and lavender are my favorites.
I just want you to turn around and look at me.
Tom was apparently bored.
She's very individualistic.
The knife had a very sharp top.
Get ready.
Put him down here.
I swear to God, I wouldn't have caught up with you to burn and you would have been the last cup of water.
The universe is expanding.
I thought you lost your hand watch.
Now you're in charge.
Not all of them sleep.
Did everyone agree?
These are my prayers.
Aren't you going?
Do you know anyone who could help?
This week is extremely hot.
No one wanted to get out of the table.
Do you think Tom would like this?
Tom's gone too far.
He's a fool.
Maybe you can help them.
The heart of the broken mirror was cut to the ground.
I can't ask him to do that.
He's eating pork cream.
I have to go help them.
Tom doesn't dare tell Mrs. White the truth.
Esperanto is an agglutinative language.
It's a strong smell.
I want to get some sleep.
The tower is seen from here.
They're left to themselves.
They're harassing me.
Tom was waiting in line.
Tom knew exactly where he was going.
I'm sorry I lied to you before.
I've got a few minutes off.
I'm sorry, but I don't have that right now.
When was the last time you were in an art gallery?
Play that song again.
I like vanilla ice cream so much.
I just ate.
Step by step, he goes down the stairs.
That's not supposed to happen.
Let me change the subject.
I'll make popcorns.
Tom put a stethoscope on the breast patient.
Shall we call him?
My sister got more presents for Christmas than I did.
What's going on with you at work?
What's the taste of languages?
Let's play football.
Tom stopped shouting.
Did you have any survivors?
I'm still at work.
Tom's warm.
Where's the bathroom?
Tom seems to know.
She gave birth to twins.
My boyfriend's a reporter.
What's Tom afraid of?
Tom would object.
What brand do you use on shampoo?
He's playing cards.
We all love you.
What were they doing?
I think you should end up with this on your own.
As far as I can see, it's nothing to Tom from a medical point of view.
I've seen how to play cards with all of them.
Tom seems confidential.
It's a shame!
Is Tom still alive?
Does Tom have a sheep?
I thought you'd live with us.
How am I gonna know how to get back?
I'm going to dinner with an old friend.
Eating can be spicy without getting mad.
Bring her home.
I'd help if I could.
Whoever wants flowers can't be a bad man.
Get your computer.
What's the key?
Tom needs to thank you.
I'll see you when I get there.
That could be true.
I wasn't sure what to do.
Camoli, let's not marry Tom.
I know what it is.
When does Tom arrive?
Could you give me the remote control?
I'm gonna make him blow your lawn.
You're helping once.
We cried in duet.
I'll set the table.
I have a lot to say.
I was in the bedroom.
There shouldn't be any problems.
It's hard for me to imagine that.
Where's the nearest workshop to repair the diggerido?
Where did you go with Tom?
Does anyone know Tom's phone number here?
I don't know what I got.
I haven't fixed it yet.
I don't work for him.
I can't wait to go home.
Tom killed himself on his 30th birthday.
Let's go and see what happens.
The concert drink has no pedals at all.
I'll keep your place.
We were all shocked.
I'm not responding well to threats.
Take a breath and keep it.
I love Boston very much.
I know a city whose inhabitants never smoked.
I must have forgotten.
Tom told Mary to go to the party with him.
Tom knows how to make it almost.
We arrested him.
What else could you do?
Please sign here.
I'll check if he's in there.
It'll be beastly.
I don't think I can move.
I'm glad I can be yours.
He's talking a lot.
I'm not very normal.
I thought they found him.
Why don't we order pizza?
The worse, the better.
Is your head full of straw?
Tom doesn't seem to speak French.
The fruit contains seeds.
You're doing fine with this.
I don’t have enough time to do everything I need to do.
The forest is my home.
There's a swelling in the head.
Vampires can't cross the threshold of a certain house without being invited.
I think Tom's under threat.
I need peace and quiet after working hard day.
If you ignore the past, you threaten the future.
The windows in my room are broken.
Do you hate him so much?
I want the truth.
Why don't we go and collect them?
Please, find her.
Tom doesn't suffer, Mary.
I'm not ready yet.
This bird doesn't know how to fly.
I'm not a truck.
Tom's studying the law.
Tom loves his job.
I'm an astronomer.
I had to lie again.
What are your plans?
Tom's a lucky guy.
We're not invited.
Paravan divided the room into two works.
I'm planning to skip lunch.
Something's bothering her.
The front door was open.
I showed my room.
I was in the theater.
I decided to go with the cops.
He's been here ever since he came from Canada.
Fernando is faster than you are.
Tom beat Mary.
I'll come with Tom.
It wouldn't be bad to slow down.
Defend yourself.
Can we give it to the repair?
You have beautiful lips.
The bites are a infectious disease.
Tom was in Boston a year ago.
I saw him right now.
What's gonna happen to us?
My hometown is by the ocean.
I left home at seven.
How's it going, Tom?
The wind has changed the direction.
Please don't ask her.
I have to take them home.
No one will ever forget you.
Why didn't you call before you got here?
I can't get an asylum answer from Tom.
Camoli, if I'd known this before.
Is there something missing?
I didn't do that for him.
She felt quite lonely.
I'm going hunting at free time.
Where did my driver go?
He's got a flaw in him.
The coat is covered with fur.
Tom's ugly.
When did you buy that with Tom?
I've been informed.
He was fast asleep.
I never doubted that.
Pianos are made in bottles.
Tom doesn't experience it that way.
Tom was sitting on the stairs and talking to a girl named Mary.
I know what you had.
He's always eating me.
Tom gave Mary John’s message.
Your wishes are my command.
I have an apartment in Boston.
Can I ask you a question?
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
Someone just called.
Can I show you something?
I'm not a big sailor.
My dad got a fire on the white drops last month.
What a sad story!
Try to get some sleep.
I don't think I'm gonna live long.
You need to help her.
Take care of him.
Tom wasn't aware that Mary was hoping to kiss her.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I don't have any friends.
Tom's playing in a band and he's very handsome.
Why can't you take it?
Put the gun down.
Tom lost interest.
Let's play the game.
It was fun yesterday.
Tom may help us if we ask him nicely.
Tom enjoys eating after restaurants.
Tom says he's used to hospital food.
This is my problem.
I don't think he's gay.
That was a secret, wasn't it?
I wouldn't think so.
I ate chicken medallions.
My dream has come true.
This is a wooden table.
The situation is tense.
I'm interested in Greek mythology, too.
The observer's got a good location.
I'm in charge of the propaganda.
We have to put him in bed.
Tom had respect for Mary.
Tom and Mary haven't heard from John in a long time.
You're not dressed.
They're pretty good.
Did you admit that?
Tom's a diabetic.
Call it whatever you want.
I'll send Tom to take care of it.
How would you fix it?
This sounds familiar.
Would you like to watch TV?
Of course!
They're not happy.
They were verbally abused.
Why were you chasing me?
I was pretty busy.
I couldn't do what you were doing.
Are you always busy?
Tom heard it.
You're below her level.
Wisdom is a curse when it does not help the one who owns it.
What is the origin of the universe?
Whoever calls, tell him I'm out.
I convinced Tom he should go to Boston with Mary.
The sheep feed on grass.
Tom's gonna give up.
I didn't know you were unhappy here.
Tom gave up thinking he was going to Boston.
I didn't find anything wrong.
Tom works effectively.
I need to be alone.
I can take it from them.
I read Tom's story.
Why are you tired?
Tom said he'd leave at 2:30.
I'll take it with him.
It's not about luck.
I think you know the rules.
I'm sincerely sorry for that.
How are we today?
There's your wife.
He's back in six.
Let these people go.
Tom's eye didn't blink.
You're a good son.
I'll get you to talk to Tom.
I almost called them.
The lamb saw her.
I have to turn the phone off.
Time's good.
This was the wrong information.
No one wants to be around him.
Dan was seen talking to an unknown man near the restaurant.
Tom with ease did it.
I know you're tired.
Why didn't you graduate?
There's a candle in front of my house.
He's the company's owner.
Peace at home, peace in the world.
They hate each other.
I'm very busy getting ready for the party.
It won't get any better.
He's done his job.
My ears are closed.
We're not worried.
Don't stay too long.
Tom lives in a boat.
Let's be creative.
You look pretty bad.
I don't want to go any further.
We went to the same church.
I arrived in Boston in two and a half.
How could Tom know?
She's studying at the deaf school.
You have a habit I don't like.
You sound very safe.
How desperate are you?
I don't know why I stayed so long.
I don't want to wait.
What's that, to be invisible to him?
The radio's off.
I turned him down, Tom.
You should be proud.
I'm in love and confused.
I keep most of my money in the bank near my office.
Do you remember what happened last year?
You're going with me and a point!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
Everything went well.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know Tom.
Let us do all we can.
I'll pay.
It's possible Tom doesn't help us at all.
I'd rather sit down.
Read this.
I arrived here a few minutes before you.
I'm helping him.
It's an honor.
I'm starting to worry.
Tom and Mary are working in the same office.
Envy is a sin.
All the kids are strangers.
They shot me.
Tom's not turning to drama.
I've completed twenty-five projects in just one month.
Tom couldn't decide not to look through the key.
Tea smells good.
Well, I lied.
Do you believe them?
That column isn't exactly vertical.
Let's see what happens if we let Tom do what he wants.
I'm very good with animals.
Did anyone tell you that?
Why are you calling?
They were still talking.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him to speak French.
We have to get back.
I think so.
I don't think Tom knows how to do it.
Tom's got a little cock.
Tom believes everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going and I'm not going.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's as tall as she is.
They were chasing them.
I didn't believe him.
Now you can't help us.
You know how much that costs?
I was thinking about visiting the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You were chased.
Let's go down the street.
There was no living soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging wells for you.
I've got a few more minutes left.
Wait a minute.
Tom loves you so much.
You're doing great.
There's no shorter way to the top, just to the breach.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was as flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's been paid a lot.
It was a shame.
You seem to care about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Automobiles are now distributed.
I can't make such a decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me that time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's wearing chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to give up on yourself.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I've had it again, Tom.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my dinner?
The organ was an older man.
I was playing tennis.
I think you're helping me.
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do as I showed you?
I'm making kajgan.
I want the blue color.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take the bribe.
Don't make my coffee.
Tom gave her a beautiful daughter - in - law.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography with that, it'll be done.
I've been calling for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play an ass?
They chose her pretty.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you my own, but I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was my responsibility to spend the night with a smart, spiritual and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and was released from parental control.
Tom's a cracker.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census took place in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you'd write me a message at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess.
He's dressed up to get his hat on.
The river of sweat began to lick my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became an atheist.
Let's just throw that away.
I'm learning math.
The keyboards are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How were you?
The movies are a great waste.
At first, I didn't see anything.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love the jazz.
They're staring at you.
I would do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests do we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everyone laughed.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
They canceled our flight because of the unfavourable weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patient.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
They may come back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against it.
The world lights up the sun.
His argument was logical.
Come here now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly right.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had made himself a tree.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
The airport's nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
The carpet's not coming out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to take care of Mary.
Mary wants to drink hot coffee and Tom's milk.
I gave the wrong address.
I happened.
I'm not fighting anymore.
It's a big chance Jane's coming.
I'm hate.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl's got a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I don't care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom's squeezing.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What's my lawyer gonna do?
The nuns are singing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'll really try to be kind to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does Tom buy?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can someone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's quiet again.
That's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Get out of here.
I have a lot of problems right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help.
Tom has a problem with anger.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a new man.
Get me a drink.
I think I'm real.
The question is whether it can or not.
Tom ran up.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I did.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to do this to work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you were only dating girls who were inferior to you.
I have to pull my belt.
Tom was about to meet Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This isn't a place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He's been building a new house.
I didn't expect you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I'm sleeping on standby.
I am always weak.
The cake looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel.
What's the matter with you?
We want to see Tom.
Where'd Tom go?
Who won the prize?
Please, come in time.
The Germans have a weak attitude toward the nude.
Now we can't help her.
Please don't move.
You can't deny it.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they put his body in a large tomb.
Women want men with mustaches.
He forgot his wallet again.
Do you accept a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do it, then who?
I wish I could have been like Tom.
I suddenly heard a loud noise.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I wasn't lucky.
His body was raised with brown hair.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I'm so pissed off, Tom.
The week is seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure you like Tom.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants of the island are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always wanted secret characters more and more.
Throw my ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's the hole with the hat?
Tom is one of the most famous American songwriters.
It can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't worry, Tom.
Tom will never come back here again.
No one likes to cry.
She was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb the remote mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's really fucked up.
Try to explain it to Tom.
We got here first.
I already gave her your number.
My soap burned my eyes.
I'm glad to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary so much.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'll be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're learning fast.
We ate very nice food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got kicked.
No one's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had that.
Look out the window.
Mary buys smelly garbage bags.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He used to work in the garden after two hours a day.
Tom rarely leaves.
Tom caught malaria while traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport's out.
You deserve a medal.
They're strong.
How did you make that mistake?
It's good to remember.
Can she do whatever she wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We bring them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I planned to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is still not quite aware of what happened.
Cocaine's a drug.
This is a little harder.
Apparently you already know the answer.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't leave.
Who owns the ship?
Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom was.
It was of great benefit to us.
What do you usually do at free time?
I'll come and save you.
I've got a rock in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked up.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was boneless coffee.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please give him a chance.
I never ask for my hands.
I didn't tell anyone, even my mother.
Don't get in my room.
That's when we started.
I didn't mean to say thank you.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go in the mail with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got some doughnuts.
I'm learning French.
I don't see you.
It was too late.
I live on the lowest floor.
Girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was thoughtless.
Mary broke our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to make them stop.
I enjoyed Tom's sensitivity.
We need to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went to walk in the woods.
Let's just leave him a little alone.
I never wear clothes.
The grill's broken.
He's gone.
His clients make mostly poor people.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why do you mind?
Tom says he wants to do it, too.
Women want men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling ourselves on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People die all the time.
He's a perfect man.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
You pulled your sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom didn't like to go.
Tom seems a little depressed this morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom's got his brain clogged.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss this with you.
Did he ask for their money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at the bank.
Death, whatever form it is, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the chromium.
We're old friends.
Tom took out his hat and politely gave it to him.
That's one reason.
Give me my book back.
Marco thinks he's writing.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I use the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very well.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such an asshole!
Who's making him a breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom didn't want to kneel.
Tom was suspended.
They were laughing.
He'll be a teacher.
I don't mean to tell Tom that.
I'd like a marine fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom seems upset.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Did you become an angel?
That is all we know about them.
Do you think that's what's bothering us?
Maybe we'll find help in the nearest village.
We hope it's okay.
You're capable, but you're forgetting.
He's been working in the embassy three months ago.
Now we're on the loose.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom became violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's mad.
It's from work.
We'll make it.
Commendation motivates students to work better.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom locked the door out of the car.
I don't agree with that.
Stop spending my money.
Tom's about thirty years old.
What's the matter?
I see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two.
Tom measured his weight.
I'm sure something happened to Tom.
Tom's had a lot of change since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title “woman ” was used only for noblemen.
Tom's been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Do you believe that?
How to choose a person only one?
I came here to feed Tom's fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I don't feel it.
My uncle was there, pouring out on the bloody bed, with a dagger stuck deep in his heart.
Someone is trying to kill us.
I'm paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long will you stay with us?
You must be very proud.
You used to be so fun.
Could you stay a little longer?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking it out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mail box?
I'm listening to your kid's laugh.
Tom suspected that Mary and I were cooking something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom's pretty thin.
Tom usually wins in arguments.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunders like Dad's?
Don't interfere with work and pleasure.
I'm working in Boston now.
You put a crown on the king's head.
Tom kept his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll meet you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's been unlocked.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got off the couch.
Don't make Tom mad.
I turned the fan on and turned it towards the wall.
This is a home jam.
Tom asked for Mary’s help.
There's no example.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's corpse in a brick grave behind the mud.
Tom writes very well.
That's not exactly the sum.
The rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you some water.
Let her bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as he saw him, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank lent her a million dollars to the company.
I still have a lot to tell you.
I always write myself down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what matters to you, and I will do my best to destroy it.
Play more relaxed.
My son always interrupts me while I'm talking.
This is Tom ringing.
I'll drive myself.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he didn't know what his name was.
I'll get to your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom shut the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have to borrow me an interesting book?
Tom was careful.
Just get in there.
I want a steel sword.
I moved to a new house last week, and yesterday I studied the library.
I told myself.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose off.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to harm you.
Tom's a unit.
The woman calls the man.
Tom really found something interesting.
Nev had a lot more of them than we did.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
Dan's getting mad.
I don't even know what it is.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't stand it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their goal?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are next.
This is the pool Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait for me in front of the mail.
Which college did you learn?
It's about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I'd better call him again.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It seemed much more than I expected.
Clear your eyes.
Tom just got inside.
He's got blood in my eye right now.
She visited Mary there yesterday.
He's overstepping it!
He's got a son who's gone.
I'm trying to work.
What kind of taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling that the show will be canceled; they didn't sell a lot of cards.
Tom's on his way.
Tom thinks he shouldn't use deodorance.
Does Tom often swim?
The girl's asleep.
Go write your homework.
Don't force the kid to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're laughing.
Tom paid me.
I'm sick of reading books.
They killed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom seems upset.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their own flaws.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what he was planning to make Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I've got the impression it's raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom look upset?
They'll probably come with a car.
I'm grateful to you.
You already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had a suitcase less than I did, they complained she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live in any part of Eastern Europe?
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a moment.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the lights on.
There's too much acid in the orange.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a cracker named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he'd take the baby out.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please don't add any comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Remember what you were wearing when I met you?
Mollus are usually accompanied by thunderstorms.
Tom wants tea with a chime.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom seems nervous.
I have a little temperature.
Tom put it on the ground.
There's no end to this lecture!
The glasses are in the glass credential.
Give us some time.
Tom was wondering why Mary didn't want to have sex with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time to change.
You should wear a helmet while you drive a motor.
We're worried about him.
Tom's a British.
John and Eva are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the shrink.
How do you not still sleep on?
Everyone knows I hate her.
He's unable to do that.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They were loving.
I burned the waste.
We both saw him.
That would be uncultural.
Tell us where they are.
Tom's a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropical region.
I think I've made myself clear.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this great?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Do you think about them?
Actually, I'm back with the ex-boyfriend.
Just do this thing.
I think Tom's beautiful.
Tom got a little question.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he knows how to play tennis, but he doesn't.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign say on the door?
Sit down.
I was thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and how she holds her head reminds me of Maria.
Don't block my way.
We're looking for them now.
I got my shoes drunk.
Tom would've come back.
She's always worth it.
What state are you a citizen of?
An elephant bone trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet Tom.
I like dogs more than cats.
There is still little space in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still doesn't know how to swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How much language do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
It's not going to take this heat.
It looks like these two have calmed down.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I need you urgently.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't have any broken money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You were brave, weren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't mean to.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Go on with your work.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a lonely man, you can say.
I can't handle this job.
Looks like we're gonna have to try harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to the party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you looking for in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree floats.
We'll keep in touch.
We're almost together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary call John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom's never been sitting for a long time.
Go with the sticks.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everyone was talking.
How proud I am of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa have died as a result of the storm.
What did you wear?
I'll get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
That's right.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought there were bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to leave soon.
Tom doesn't know how to feel.
There's a little more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The gate was pissing me off.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was everything just a dream?
I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a pop.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is Tom like that?
I have problems with the sinuses.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's running out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She's handing the chicken.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any website.
They dropped the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all my money, but it seems I was wrong.
I've got three Chads.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been a week, up and down.
Slowly recovers from the disease.
I want a tournipop.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom seemed really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly is on the roof.
Her face was tortured with a sperm.
Tom's just.
This is what you need to do first.
We met around noon.
Nothing's done to me tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
You know what that looks like?
Bet you've won.
I'm so confused.
They were waiting outside.
That's why he was ordered to leave the firm.
I'd know what you're up to.
Tom's trying to be a teacher.
I wish you a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom should go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why are you blaming them?
Get over it.
We're being childish.
Tom was a boss.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom's getting up.
Let's go outside and talk.
I don't know what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
She's got the tire down.
We made ourselves a tree.
This is much better.
I'll get her to blow your lawn.
Tom's doing math.
Tom pulled his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to inherit.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with kids every week.
Tom was always stubborn.
You cook bread in your ovens.
You're crazy.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
I know how much that's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and straw.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They've been through the door.
Tom came to stay with us a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the other night.
That's so horrible.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them an apple.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't have any use for that.
It's still not working.
Cite me an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Was he honest?
The Filjane was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't give up.
They're close.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
The vampire came back to life in the dead chest.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I'm done with my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be handed over?
Tom's got a bruise on his eye.
Tom's firm is in danger.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I left this morning, Tom was still on his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom is clouded.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary would be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can smile at me.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money for me right now.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, and you?"
Molnja hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They raised my salary again.
I'll never go there again.
I'm filming a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom's got work to do.
What do we do today?
Do you believe in horoscope?
I know I'm going.
I'm contributing.
It was a real disaster!
Tom's good at his profession.
I thought about it.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom put all this in order.
I'm not betraying her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water's milk.
First, there was no plant life in this climate.
You're incapacitated.
What was Tom's answer?
You'll do as I command you.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did what I was supposed to do.
Tom's too far away.
Tom wants to write.
Tom's very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, well?
I have a great interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not a scientist at that.
She's got tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom doesn't tell the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Are they going to arrest me?
Unfortunately, that violates all the rules.
Why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Come on, beer.
Mr. Kimura is waiting for you on the line.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was released by a gentleman.
No, and it's not even under the chair.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't hold on.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must be feeling lonely.
What did you ask for on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
Our solar system is constantly moving.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw Mary's papers on the desk.
Tom did this.
I'm learning art history.
I don't really agree.
What's on the agenda?
There's plenty more.
Looks like these two are back in touch.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
Moral choice is for the translator whether to translate something or not. Some things are better left in the language he produced.
You're mean.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to ask Tom for permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask for his help.
Do I look normal?
Will you eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Take a look.
Give me the French key.
Tom seems distracted.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom got on the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's courtesy.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun is constantly changing.
That's exactly what Tom told me.
Tom looked Mary deep in his eyes and smiled.
It was very crowded in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all right.
The stars shine.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without shaking my knees.
Tom's a white man.
Tom could do better.
I didn't call you for that, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
To find them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be famous in time.
I don't know.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait anymore.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can eat lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're taking off.
We're gonna go shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's a jerk.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would he lie to you?
He has a passive character.
Maybe someone was following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a cure right.
We were on the coast.
I don't want you to abuse them.
Depends on your decision.
That's performable.
Tom reacts badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom was watching you.
It's not attractive.
A few people understand that.
You're very cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
She was delighted to meet her lawyer.
That's our best chance.
It smells like flowers.
Tom's got a crush on himself.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom's a fire extinguisher and he's starting to spit.
She's a tennis player.
I wasn't in Boston the night they killed Tom.
I need you for a second.
Have fun as much as you can!
Who are these?
Speak for yourself.
It was a result of great difficulties.
She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think they're ever for that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
So we didn't agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are ridiculous to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't hold on.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer's stuck.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
So the conscience really makes us all cowards.
You don't have to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I don't expect anything less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
Tom took the box.
I should've checked.
He couldn't take off his pants.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You're wrong.
We're glad to see you.
Now you must leave, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen emits green light.
The English has become my favorite subject.
Things happened fast.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we faced terrible news.
The knee wound is now knee-deep.
Clear your eyes.
Mary's scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't touch anything.
Tom's an agricultural worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
Since when did Tom sleep?
It's our job to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs some rest.
What are you eating, otherwise?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mantal bomb?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'm going down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
He's got blood in his brain now.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't a man that's easy to deal with.
I don't want pork.
She wants to run.
I need a sea urchin.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom read the note.
The kids drew pictures on the sidewalk with the chalk.
You're wondering what you've kept so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I need to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom married at 26 years of age.
We've already cleared that.
You want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, it's not even under the chair.
Tom and I are drinking friends.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's hearing something.
Tom is always trying to act as he thinks is right.
Apparently, Tom often doesn't understand what's going on.
Come visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She wants to be proud of the magnificent patterns she has in the house.
I'm not a resident.
What do you have in the bowl?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's happening right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
Who's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning piano.
They need the money.
It's a good swim.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You don't get involved in this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I watched TV when Tom came.
You're not following.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually very common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Didn't I do anything to upset me, Tom?
The triangles don't have four angles.
There's not enough light to read here.
Tom's been counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned off her shirt.
Let me guess.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've been looking everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everybody's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon is coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a suspicious answer.
Wake me up as soon as she's divorced.
Mr. Gorbachev, drop the wall!
Tom seems intimidating.
Tom's done it.
It's like it's supposed to be.
Let's try and get together.
That'll be hard.
I don't like retirement.
Thank you for asking.
I have good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll investigate it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was not to be sent at all.
The girl wearing a scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you doing?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The Prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so loving.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's nothing urgent.
I'll get it now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't care about all of you.
I'll come by the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
I'm not very dear to Tom.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary a year ago.
Tom goes to school with a car.
Did you see?
I'll have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy the calendar.
Everyone's talking about me.
Do you ever think of us?
Do you write the speeches?
It was a great show.
We should go find them.
Last time I was home Friday night when I was thirteen years old.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing it for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
You just got me a macky.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to figure out a plan.
Tom's so angry.
Tom's going to sleep.
Let's protect our peace!
Tom is well armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said we should stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them so much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to feed my thirst.
Tom's here in time.
It's boring TV today.
Oh, great!
Tom found a detail with four lists.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom seems really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found the evidence.
We got to say hello to them.
Didn't you smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where'd you get that scar?
You're nobody and nothing.
We're not gonna find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds quite valid.
It's a law!
The water's breaking the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom's here safely.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
Here, I want challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done that yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Watch out for the rumors they're flying out of the fire.
It's just invented.
Tom kept quiet all night with Mary.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I keep dreaming of you.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's get a soul together.
I'm sure he'll put in the closer test.
Let's go to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her in the mouth passionately.
Tom went to the store and bought three cans of pumpkin spray.
It was awful.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom's turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my dad.
The kids love cake.
He's been a long way off.
I can end up with Tom.
Tom's getting pissed off.
This is from us.
In an emergency, what number do I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't even touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary collected all the money for Tom.
Enough with the bullshit.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always loved his son.
Tom has a big mouth.
It looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started beating.
The peppers are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work early.
We have everything.
I burned his cookies.
When's the school year over?
You're right from the beginning.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say "bye"?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be fakes.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom's inconspicuous.
His girlfriend's weakened.
Between me and Tom, it's over.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom screaming woke up from the nightmare.
Tom's got a weak look.
The guy didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it over?
Everyone wants lasting peace.
We met a day ago.
Where's his stuff on Tom?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom took his eyes off.
The tide wasn't so happy that a peacemaker was coming.
Open up.
Put your seatbelt on.
You might be wrong.
I burned the cake at the same time.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my counselors about what subjects to take.
I already wrote everything I needed to write.
Make sure you don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
Now there's nobody in the school.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's dot.
Is Dan aware of what he did?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in this room?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice man.
I never change the sleeping schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen him?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll transport you.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary put something in Tom's ear.
Tom knows how to be very vindictive.
I've seen it turn around.
We're gonna miss Tom a lot.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do anything like that before.
You're very stubborn.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Dada really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you ask Google for me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just showering.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's on his own again.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're modeled.
What do you want?
Tom found a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility for him is a burden.
Tom's still playing golf, right?
I've had lunch today.
My pop music is my favorite kind of music.
Half an hour has passed.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was amazing.
I don't see anything.
He's a pretty unpleasant man!
They blew up the beach tent.
I didn't want that at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and put another one in that place.
Stop!
Do you want cheese?
I'll call you.
She's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
The roofs don't shine in any way.
That was very rude of Tom.
It's double.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I'm mad.
Let's get you out of here.
Drying is energy consumption.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom looked inside.
At the same time, you are difficult and easy, and pleasant and bitter; I can't live with or without you.
Let's say you're right now.
Tom's doing great.
I don't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's hot here.
That disappoints him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I don't know.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You didn't praise us.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look like each other.
Don't forget him.
We have to find them first.
I'm taking care of it.
Tom hit Mary on the head with the roof.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better both get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fussy.
You need to help them.
Tom didn't even cry.
He wrote a book, and that's great.
Tom turned the quay.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we had a much bigger problem.
I'm looking at ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is worse than stupidity and indifference.
They're all messing with each other.
Tom was protesting.
What are the websites from?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're sympathetic.
I hate ducks.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I've been cleaning snow all day.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to run?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
Is he far away from Boston?
They're paying me to help you.
This jacket's too small for me.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could prepare it by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very effective.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with it later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train while he was at work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the rug out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
A guard is coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that's stuck in the locker.
The gulabies symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I will do everything for the good of mankind.
Did you really stay home all night?
Annie's music is beautiful.
Is she a cab driver?
I'm sure I'm losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
I'm sleeping.
It is not scientifically proven that there is a connection between the character and the blood group.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who doesn't agree?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom was brave.
Avoid smoking too much.
Tom's a freezer.
I pushed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We've been looking everywhere.
I love your website very much.
I'll get you.
Push this button.
Tom really can fight.
What's actually bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom broke his car.
You've got to get through the trouble.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All gooseberries carry eggs.
We'll take something.
I think Tom's cruel.
Don't answer my letter.
We calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I'm looking at how things are.
I'm making very stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Wait a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where did Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out of here.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom wants adventures.
They don't have a hat.
A lot of trees have collapsed.
Lions don't make a difference in colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer's crazy.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look here.
I want you to get my money back right away.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a really nice time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try and do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you're married to Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote you a passage from one of those letters.

It's Fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm putting the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their bags.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
They don't even throw a curse.
Did you get Tom's invitation?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny it.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What is the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for her help.
I decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
The hives have been living for a long time.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom's sleeping very hard.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yes, I do.
Did you get here by car?
I don't know the end of the story.
We're done.
I'm sure.
Will you wait a minute?
You're among friends.
You're something I'm weak.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call me?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start again.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for having me.
Susan's actually your half sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I'm guessing the eggs from the hippo.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
It's love for crazy people.
Why would you help him?
Tom's got his shoes on.
We've lost faith in humanity.
Tom's handling the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how am I to blame for that?
Why do we all hate each other?
Tom, lend me some money.
Am I bothering you?
End violence; fight for peace.
Look how I do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.

Let me see what I can do.

Can I honor you for dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Come down, Dick, it's dinner time.
I'm fighting.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe at least Tom will apologize.
He's getting into the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come on in.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses this month.
Nobody's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Did you pay already?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom put his face out.
What benefit do I have from you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
He burns me when he wears that suit.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor under this.
They believed it.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't get married.
I tried to explain, but I didn't.
I need to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
The dolphins are kind of boobs.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom may be alive.
Will the future be like scientific fiction?
Tom's laughing at you.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to open it.
It narrows the choice.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to look after his kid.
I've drawn the word "Alice" to highlight it.
Third luck.
We need to get out of here.
This is an airy test that's popular in the Philippines.
Nobody said anything.
Let us strive for the good and to give up the vices.
You're smart.
I'm against the projects.
Didn't you get tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom was listening to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I got here too late.
I could have known Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There's some writing reports.
It hurts here.
You're distracting Tom.
Where did we go?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask.
Just be careful with that.
I was just messing with you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to sleep now and finish tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Illnesses often come up at the worst of times.
The dog's staring at me like he wants to eat me.
They were animals dressed in human skin, and they were not real people at all.
The man's starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is in progress, but good memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want for a drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom think?
It was really nice.
Everyone dies sometime.
I know how to stay calm.

I got this fax from her.
Black cats bring bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I love it so much!
Is this true in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom gave Mary a walk.
She's got ears like edra.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only eighteen years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom was wondering what Mary would say.
I don't like how that sounds.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not unintelligible,
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I guess you read my report.
Tom's back.
Don't repeat yourself.
The niggers are red.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look very good.
You let Tom down.
Burn it.
Tom looked like he didn't like it.
What else can Tom do?
I want to become physically and mentally stronger.
She's a very happy girl.
If I could stay, I'd stay.
Please, stop.

You're my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two lines.
The titles should draw attention to readers.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than surrender.
I'm actually working here.
Tom suffers.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like how you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I was watching a French movie with an English translation.
Tom was laughing at Mary.
Tom's back in confidence.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says the child's diseases are fake.
Dan had a rough relationship with Linda.
Everyone's back.
Do you have a violin?
Give us a call.
Maybe Tom could sing at our wedding.
Which one would you choose, Tom?
The hospital isn't big there.
Most people have to work to support themselves.

They're staring at him.
That's for them.
That's Tom's dog.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to go again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do social work to make amends for all I have done.
Tom's on the tops.
Are you still afraid of spiders?

Do you understand the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
He's weak in vision.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I've prepared a speech.
The juices have a sharp appearance.
I wrote that to them.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom was snoring.
We want a new carpet.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.

You deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not taking the sneakers.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working for nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the real words?
It hurts so much here.
I hate this carpet.
I'm a little sick.
Tom's been through.
Tom couldn't remember where he left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That thing's over.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have any pets?
You were wrong about the picture.
I'll get it.

What do you need, Tom?

Drop your weapon and take it.
And see you tomorrow?

You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?

That's not something for which man should be prepared.
Tom and Mary are playing rhyme.
I made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leaned on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think you'd prefer a son.
How did you get here?
You left the book.
Don't catch my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'll go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret journal.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We've been talking for up to two hours.
I learned about you from him.
I know you're upset right now.
He's gone.
A long walk called his appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom served himself with a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
There's just no way I'm gonna make Tom swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do it, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laughed again.
My wedding must be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Is it cold outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom's in danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair's broken.
Tom's the tallest guy in the class.
Tom, you grew up fast.
That was our only comfort.
Nobody would care.
Did you write in a diary today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can you do it on your own?
Is it your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I left prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the key, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into it now.
Why are you blaming me?
Come on, Tom.
I'm just gonna try and get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause disease.
Up and down we're ready.
Tom has a sharp hearing.
I bought them.
I told you I can't.
Tom's books are translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take the rug off.
I helped him break the table.
I ate a cupcake last night.
It's better for your health to go up the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is bad.
I'm sorry I even told them something.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could find someone else.
Take me to two and a half.
Tom's gone.
I slept in the yard.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That can work.
Aren't you cold with short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
He's got an eye for art.
That was the worst party I've ever had in my life.
I need a cover.
Tom's rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Asian Japanese movies?
Did you get them?
The French language was slang first.
Don't you ever call her?
We burned their cake.
The fingerprints on the knife confirm her guilt.
Can I wait here?
We can look for a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe he didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I made you some cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I sent Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real damage.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
You didn't save the bell.
You got me on your head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems stopped.
You're having fun with your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom seems lonely.
How come you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
It smells like meat.
Do I need to know you?
Tom has already covered all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I don't think so.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
The picture contains bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it's time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just pulled Tom's room out last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a dead chest, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it were higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air since Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets very much.
You need to hurry.
Everyone's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a cop.
We despise her.
He got there in front of them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom worked on the table the new muse he just bought it.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's snooped.
The landscape is superior.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under your bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was severely restricted.
We're gonna have to hurry up.
Tom celebrated the victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'll try to bet.
Essente's here.
Tom wanted to unpack himself.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you get the traffic?
The water only needs three minutes to shut down.
They could fire me for this.
What's the point?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was so great.
Dan was about Linda for a very short time.
I can't answer the question.
I want to take a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, they are endowed with intelligence and conscience, and they need to treat one another in the spirit of mankind in general.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a thunderstorm.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do himself.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
The soup's frozen.
Why don't you go and collect it?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to understand.
There's nothing going to cost you to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom looked in the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend?
It seems familiar to me.
I'm jealous.
I offered to smoke his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
It's got its own limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Bosiloc, apologise, rosemary, temianite, and original are popular herbs.
We're ugly.
You're a smart man.
Everything seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He's sitting on the bench.
Unknownness always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door's open.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew he couldn't trust Tom.
I know I keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
So I'm kind of flattered even.
I'm practicing.
She might have lied to you, but she doesn't have me!
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I'll get it.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled out some money.
The room was a buyer.
It's just to solve this problem.
They have to remove the bullet that was stuck to his neck.
Epten's fun.
Does Tom look upset?
If you can, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but apparently I lost your sunburn.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect's confession.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how it hurts to bite you alone.
We import grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, prayer, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to look in the dark.
Tom's busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the daytime?
I have a question about her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
Looks like we're not considering asking Tom.
My brother will be here tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are you caloric compacts?
They'll get it soon enough.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary for the knife.
I broke the vase today.
That's what I care about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't miss you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make him some makeup.
I was waiting outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and make some.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and your phone number?
Tom was throwing me with a stone.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so mad about Tom?
Tom will be here a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They were standing under a lot of stress in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I've got a couple of reasons to think about it.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't really understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
Some of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a pretty jacket.
I like your coffee.
They're all sinking.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I found out there's a film called "The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was away from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still not able to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many more days before Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I don't care about that.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
The deaf are transporters to the plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom cut himself off.
I'll start tomorrow.
I wasn't honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm eating from Tom.
I want cooked bones.
What did Tom do here?
She fell asleep while she was driving and caused a traffic accident.
We were bitten.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with cheering.
It's okay.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is this camera used?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French very well.
Be careful not to overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, I don't understand German.
We'll need about three hours to get down from this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I've been disqualified.
Did you finish the package?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's getting better.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get involved.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You're too thirsty for him.
The president announced that the United States would launch a satellite in orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be a lunatic.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I too early to come?
It sounds pretty loud.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Take care, Tom.
Tom's on the tops.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up till 2:30.
You really do.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America didn't have the right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did you give him the dog?
Tom doesn't listen to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Was that all the excitement?
Tom's gone somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm's ringing.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
It's an unspoken fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to admit it.
The sky is blue.
We don't talk much.
You're a loving man.
Tom's getting a little murky.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom gave up on his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to God, and Osaka is similar to Madeline.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't Tom stop?
I said I'd bring it.
The survivors are kind of boobs.
I'll start.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm cooking soup in a big tender.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell this to you if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the volleyball going?
He wipes his wet hair with his foot.
If an adult lies to a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
I may not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled the screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom was shaking his hands.
Open the teapots.
You can't let that fit.
Tom opened the van.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom went to the next question.
That was considerate.
I want life.
Tom's not in his bed.
That was all my idea.
I don't want any puzzles.
The book will help you write your skills.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please blow up the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates laughed at her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he already saw Mary this morning.
I'm going to have my toasts with honey.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of countries.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the papal escaped from the cage.
We went to get some strawberries.
We live on Earth.
I love sunglasses.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom threw his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's impressed.
I almost wouldn't come.
I was doing cake.
Look at the number.
I was impressed by your design.
You told me to call when it was.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom gave up.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
Last month, I had an infection of the massive fever.
Look at the girls.
I'm going to drop the kiln.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate the foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What benefit do we have from it?
I'm just with someone I want to be with.
You invited me to your wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thank you!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is quick.
The door's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want us to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were completely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has very good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You need to eat more.
Tom's not gonna be a sport.
Shouldn't we help them?
I wasn't sorry for them.
Tom feels he should be redeemed.
This message is for them.
When am I gonna get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom took the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your shoulder.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mail box?
The Internet is a serious matter.
Mars is the red planet.
I took the dog with a stone.
Tom's staring all the time.
It's seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
Demek, I wrote this book!
Don't put so much beer in the soup.
Let's not be fooled.
They looked around.
Tom looked through the window and saw Mary play with her dog.
Tom was drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need Tom's help.
They were happy.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you need to clear it.
Tom's not doing well today.
We don't see.
Mahmoud can't stand to lose.
No one's listening to you.
Okay, convince me.
I'm ready for him now.
It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hatred usually go into pairs.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants were taken off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly.
I agreed.
Tom admitted he had the red wine thrown out.
Do you want a dog?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is good.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Did you hear about us?
We visited Laura's castles.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little ahead.
I think of him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
It would be a pleasure to keep him.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as much as your soul wants.
Just grab my hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very pendant in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so much fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How much stomach do I do every day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned to go.
Tom's kind.
What was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Day's turned into a question.
You've got a lot of eyelashes.
Isn't that what you mean?
I thought you were tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want you all to shoot them.
I think I'm writing pretty well.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
You smell it, then get in there.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems more confident.
Do you want to drink water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the quantity is not correct.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
The squares have four angles.
I kept working.
They're developing addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll wait there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat down and shut up.
Bring the shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary's gone to her mother's.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one was listening to Tom.
You want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finish the mess.
Tom wipes out the knife from the farms.
Tom was struggling to stay focused.
Tom's got a long beard.
One of them addresses me.
I can arrange for that to happen.
Are your balls bleeding?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his pint on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
I'm looking at a seductive look.
Come on, don't be ashamed.
I don't want to eat cloned animal meat.
How far did you go?
My dad's very strict.
Maybe I'd better come back later.
What are the tigers eating?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Are you going down?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
You looked me through the glasses.
Linda told Dan he was demanaging her.
Why would it bother them?
Let's not bother Tom.
It's tough.
I just need a break.
I have a warrant for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to act pretty much.
I need to get rid of us.
Why is the sky blue?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did Tom get hurt?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
You came over my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has struggled with depression for several periods of his life.
Can I get your bags?
I'd trust that in my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What do you have to worry about?
I need dinner.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class looks.
There were pitches of penguins on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called a sniper.
I want to brush my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move it.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not impressed.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope you like the new boss.
Did you mention the results of the test?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was hungry.
She's studying English.
With such a terrible dream, he will become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We'll survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We'll visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom broke the chewing tire.
Let it be mine.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving me birth.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to develop bad habits!
She's starting to act weird.
Probably won't pay the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she was interested in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
We're as strong as you are.
The president looked strong.
What am I supposed to buy?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'm gonna be in Boston this week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you were playing chess better than me.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are scared enough, everything can happen.
You're a narrow town.
He was running as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's got his neck stuck.
Grab the day.
What's Tom calling?
He's very handsome.
Let the buyer be careful.
Tom's been running for hours.
Now's the time for a rematch.
Most virgins have a whole chemo.
You can get out of here.
Why did you blow up only two sausages?
When I feed the poor, they call me a saint, and when I ask why the poor don't have food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what he's got for dinner.
Tom's interested in French history.
Because the bus had stopped, we waited a long time for the rain.
You'll be able to do it.
Is there that dog?
I'm resting.
Mary was wearing fake twitches.
That's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French better than he really did.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
I got my shoes drunk.
That medicine calmed the patient down.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look stupid.
His mother's an American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom having fun?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
That means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fushersky did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed upset.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
I'm making up my mind, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blind.
I've been looking for him for a while.
That's good.
Tom's sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
We'll never know now.
Should we wait here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got rid of him.
I prefer goat cheese from cow.
We understand that.
How's that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten milk products in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Did you meet Tom?
Is everybody having fun?
I've been awake all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know he's with you.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
Stolars are cutting wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
It's the end.
Single - sex couples should not be able to get married.
The cow forgot it was a calf once.
Give them a picture.
Tom was buried alive.
The sewing's a handjob.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm so confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister drop the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you turn the cigarette off?
What were they laughing at?
Why would he believe her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
Still no sign of Tom’s voice.
Then I was home.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other ships.
I don't have any money anymore.
The table is plastic.
Sunlight is supposed to be the best means of disinfection.
You'll take a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
You've been assaulted.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very useful.
You hung me.
Did you call for quick help already?
Bring us after lunch, our plan is to walk into the park.
You have to answer the question.
Turn on the red light.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much do you wear?
Now we need it.
I don't know what you're looking for here.
Blood runs through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
They won't help lies.
My right leg hurts.
The apple's healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where are we from?
I really don't know.
Do you have a hammer?
Tom's cooking for attention.
Day had no compassion for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave a message for her?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
Their houses are built from stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't know English, I don't know Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom wasn't thinking about things like that.
There's a wind.
I'm just kidding you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
And I bought a handcuff.
Just sit there.
Tom barely knows how to go.
So you said you wanted to go with us?
I expect visitors.
They saved the entire team.
What age did you begin to master?
You're scaring me.
But not in front of people.
The firm's bankrupted.
I'm twelve years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not much of a talker.
You were right, guys.
It's happening.
There was no other injury.
I decided to take a train.
I'm sure you can do it.
You gonna eat at home or outside?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'm going to get worse.
Are you laughing at me?
I think I know him.
I'm drinking milk.
Don't upset Tom.
That's a tough task.
You need to make him listen.
I'm surprised it's so easy.
Camoli would have been here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom often calls Mary.
Thank you, darling.
They increased the kingdom territory.
I didn't come here to hurt people.
I'm sure Tom already knew about it.
My mother's sister and my aunt.
I've been looking everywhere for them.
Tom's incapacitated.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny it.
It's gone red.
I have to go.
Whoever sleeps with dogs wakes up with pain.
His aunt's alone in London.
It's not a great miracle.
I'm sick.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
Maybe he'll come back tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom hooked up on the creek.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mother?
It doesn't matter.
Listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him for you.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these wise advice.
His statement is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Take your things away.
Where did you put it?
Tom doesn't know how to accept defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What do I get from that?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't very busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for a man.
You don't have to be present for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin it.
You're very passionate.
My headache's gone.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handkerchief.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that pretty?
Hey, don't let it be your fault.
Isn't that unusual?
I cut myself off the wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom must be stopped.
Isn't that excessive?
They know what happened.
Tom takes the scarf off his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower was in the middle of ruins.
Tom's a big materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little.
Have you read it?
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Give me the spoons.
The masks love cold weather.
This is a little sloppy in my suit.
Tom never lived in Boston.
You've forgiven me already?
Did Tom know?
Would Tom lie to you?
I'm not even tired.
She's afraid we won't lose money.
Tom swallowed his ex.
Canada produces good wheat.
He loves his dad very much.
Let's get up there.
It's not that we're doing something.
Tom had a good time today.
Milton hasn't slept well all week.
When's the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning to stay with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's not a secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you preparing for?
Now this is your house.
How about you try some sushi?
How are you doing?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life by doing only what I love.
It's not my decision.
Despite our expectations, there are no charges.
The hunt is one of the seven deadly heats.
Tom's not responsible.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw Mary ready to say something.
I'm not gonna be in town next week.
And they sown seed, and grew up, and reaped; and the river, and them that were with them, turned about by the way.
He hates his dad.
Tom helped us escape.
Tom had an accident.
Tom took Mary home.
I ski a lot.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm as qualified as Tom.
When's my turn coming?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a print error.
It doesn't happen very often to buy a thousand-dollar hat.
Is the police coming?
We have to find him first.
Dan smiled at the assistants with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I barely got caught.
I can't get involved.
You beat them.
They shut up.
Tom's coming back soon.
I'd be in.
History is writing the winners.
Tom was the only one on the ship when he exploded.
Who's gonna make up for the blue one?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
Nothing's bothering me here.
You cheated on me.
It's for the heat.
Nothing's sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
Actually, no one knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
You were looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're messing with her.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted that way.
I was in three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We've got fish for dinner tonight.
I don't eat restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost there.
Looks like you've got an infection.
I don't get anything smarter.
The sky is red in summer.
I'm here to wish you luck.
I'd be glad to see you too.
They must be happy.
We need to fix this.
I'm not English.
We'll deal with it.
The bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan understood this well.
Do you want a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
They all love him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a hard test.
It's hot here in hell.
I looked into that.
This is your job!
Please come back to me.
He's cold in here.
Congratulations on the wedding.
Children, stay here.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Are you kidding your dog?
It's beautiful!
The palace has a high tower.
The kids have homework.
Let's go get them.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom's gone away.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I won't mind if you leave.
Tom himself came here.
I forgot my joke.
We've been through a lot.
Tom wanted everyone to think he was dead.
Scientific research often requires serious compromises.
Tom just got his prosthetics out.
I have to try to find him.
I took care of it.
Tell me the details.
Are you busy with something?
Go wake Mary up.
You almost missed him.
I hate that pipe.
Her doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you as you are.
It's funny.
It's very relaxed.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was threatened.
Camoli, I wouldn't have done that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why does no one want to help us?
The hole's tight.
You should go help him.
Do you enjoy it?
I've had a great night.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom let go of the sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to carry such gifts.
I'm ashamed of him.
Shut up or they'll throw you out.
Get away from me.
Let's get started!
How long is the road?
I'm good, thanks!
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's getting dark.
Tom was raised.
I'm surprised Tom went with Mary.
He's blind from birth.
The book contains fifteen life stories.
Tom worked all night.
Tom was just here.
I gave up.
How long have you been waiting?
The socks and shoes are new.
I haven't eaten pizza in a while.
Something wouldn't make me happy anymore.
I suggest you learn more.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
Tom was buried in Boston.
Tom's not my cousin.
What's Tom talking about now?
How are you two?
Dalida died of overdose with sleeping pills.
His opinions are worthless.
Sign down, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know that Tom lived in Boston?
Tom, I only wore one shoe.
You don't want to do something that will remind them that you're actually not big enough to be here.
I got the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a curse.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
Oh, my God, he's coming back.
Ish, jukele!
They got caught in the water.
I guess you're busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think.
Let's all help them.
This is a glass mosaic.
Tom didn't come home at all last night.
I think we ate enough.
This is very difficult for them.
The witches don't cry.
Tom taught me to make pancakes.
The one who washes the car is Mr. Jones.
Tom looks excited.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
I know Tom's in Boston now.
That's her.
I can transport you.
Is Tom safe?
Still, there's a solution.
You're unorganized.
I'm trying.
I'm sure Tom will make it like this.
I don't think I've ever been so scared before.
Can you do the job?
We've got to get him back.
You're uncultural.
Are you sports?
It just sounds boring.
Bring him in.
Tom lied to us all the time.
Tom didn't say he'd help us.
Tom took the knife.
The people in Madrid are crazy.
That's completely incorrect.
I'd better call her first.
He's very social.
Tom can't wait anymore.
I'm just practicing to look nice when I'm naked.
A thousand years are a thousand years.
I'll put it on your account.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
It's an honest word.
We've got three guards working in a different way.
We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Would you be able to introduce yourself in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox.
Does Tom contribute?
This is a little embarrassing.
We were both busy.
I've been away for three hours.
I want crossword puzzles.
I expected them to be here.
Tom took a picture of this.
Tom shut his mouth.
So you don't hate him?
Stop acting like a child.
Tom's not a fire.
He never hired them.
I want cake.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom's a retired dentist.
That was very nice.
I'm going to hide.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
Soon he will leave his parents ’ home.
Tom gave up.
Lucenes are barely visible.
Tom's a jug.
I'll take you home.
My husband's a doctor.
It's a spider's casino.

It's deeper than that.
Henry doesn't have more than six dollars.
We all have our price.
The answer to both questions is no.
They're amazing.
The legend says she was a siren.
I really miss my mother's cooking.
Was Tom in Boston last week?
I'm used to talking in public.
You were crying luckily.
Tom's out of jail.
I'm glad I work here.
Where did Tom say he wanted to go?
I'm waiting for it to burn green.
Do you want me to massage your shoulders?
Get on my head.
I got right on my head.
Tom told me he was planning to go to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm going and I'm going.
I'm going to change my clothes.
You dropped my earring.
It might have sounded like a proposal, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd be a great mother.
Tom's still working.
Please find my head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom disagrees.
They rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, it'll blow my movie.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but never really, it couldn't happen here.
Tom was burning himself in front of the fire.
I don't want to talk about this.
It would be very normal for you to be angry with Tom.
Tom swims every day.
This is the best thing I've ever tasted.
Why don't you call him?
I want to use these.
Tom's allergic to the mold.
You should try to write in a decent way.
I'll sit there.
She's older than him.
I burned their cake.
Tom is very patient.
We can start.
Come alone.
You're the one who's been snitching your pockets.
Tom asked for his lawyer.
Write to Tom.
I had to help her.
Don't risk it.
Isn't that good news?
Let's assume she was here.
Tom's always mad at me.
Tom's just looking.
Here's your schedule today.
Tom didn't wait.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thank you in advance.
The question is, what are you gonna do?
Tom told Mary he loved her.
Well, don't be quick.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
He was back two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you're late, I'll be late for you, too.
You really should have let me call a cab.
I freckle the apple pie.
The top of the horse's coat calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book fully covers the subject.
I think this is over.
Linda wore modest clothes all the time.
You didn't smoke?
They let me go.
Tom never thanks anyone.
He called on his classmates.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom got in touch with Mary.
Are you just cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to a zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna need Tom's permission.
His joke didn't all smile.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is pointless.
They ate.
How many cup of coffee a day is too much?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I danced with my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You would do the same for me.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate it.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I made a smile.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I'm happy today.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop lying to each other.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man were you?
I should try to help them.
Can I get a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom makes three times more money than I do.
I cried one.
Write your birth date.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
I'll call him later.
These are as good as they are.
She looked excited.
We're wasting our time.
Tom said he and Mary wouldn't be able to come to the party.
Just try and find him.
Tom put his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's tiny.
Is the difference visible?
Visit us tomorrow.
Tom was visiting Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do that.
Is this your bag?
The most important thing will help her to get to sleep.
This is Nina, your grandson.
I'll change the vegetables.
They've been scanning for half an hour.
Longoon's been a lot of intense stuff lately, but he doesn't see even the slightest result of it.
Dan found out Linda was looking for the police.
I'm getting dinner ready.
Please come to me next Saturday, if you want.
I'm not sure.
That's not necessary anymore.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom's fast asleep.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She was dreaming of becoming a nurse.
Tom has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hatred.
You have a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thank you for coming.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom wouldn't have succeeded without Mary's help.
So there's Tom?
Last night he had her drunk in a meat loaf.
I'm in.
Do you need rent?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to repay you.
They're coming again.
You're really sweet.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is a no-good joke.
I wouldn't believe Mary at all.
I've never seen the grapevine.
I don't think they followed us.
I feel free.
Just smile and go on.
You didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary escape the prison.
Tom's got no tea.
I'm tired.
But that's not an argument!
Tom got a drink.
What do you want me to tell the kids now?
Leave him alone, Tom.
I've been through the shock.
It's a good system.
I don't remember Tom like this.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How did you get on vacation?
Back then, we were just a few people in a group of gorillas.
She started washing her fingers in her hair.
I'll tell my wife.
If I don't invite Tom to my party?
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
You travel a lot?
Did you tell Tom about the pain in your back?
That's what everyone does.
Tom is often unpredictable.
They loved each other.
Tom collects stamps.
I want you to find her.
The light of the sun.
And it's a lot of what is made up of members B, B, and A.
Tom's free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
I'd be happy if you three came back out.
What's stopping you?
Tom's got thin lips.
The kids are making bubbles.
Tom practicing violin at least half an hour each day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's very fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered along with them.
Camoli Tom had more time for me.
I'm digging for him.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a big shock.
You're burning the car.
She managed to learn to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I don't have the power of will when it comes to practice.
Come on to Tom.
This is one of the best sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room's a rshum.
It's for your own good.
I want to watch football on TV.
I'd still like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need that kind of food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't get his money.
The more I have, the more I need to clean up.
I found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to mess with the sun cream.
Was it hard on you?
Tom's voice barely heard.
Don't be late.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days do you usually need to get there?
Don't forget these.
When will that happen?
We're gonna have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or is she just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom's good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is just love in search of words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom's gonna wait.
I'm begging you to settle down.
The true story is a little different from what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon slowed down.
Who wants insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Make three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted as if he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you came?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she immediately knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; anyway, you have to.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you happy to see me?
Merissal and Johnny are eating pizza.
It's not a great miracle.
We need something to get our mind off our problems.
I called you yesterday.
Let me focus.
She sells sea schools.
Guard the prisoner.
We all like you.
The kid was crying and crying for hours.
I'll go ask them.
Tom's not like his brother at all.
Tom was an inn.
That was brilliant.
Please tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you impressed?
Tom wouldn't be able to do it on his own.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce Mr. Tanaka to you.
You know how late it is?
Tom cut the question to eight pieces.
Maybe you'll need it.
I have chest pain.
I can't untie the knot.
Give me back my money.
You have to show up first.
My dad's a quiet man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional tapan.
You stole my new hand watch.
It doesn't look very different.
It's over.
Tom and make room for Mary on the bench.
We're looking for him.
It's okay.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know whether to be happy or not.
Did you get her?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his trip.
Your excuse's up and down right.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary came out of the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the precious stones last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I've already packed.
Since when do you feel the movements of the fetus?
I can't do it on my own.
You better let me do that.
This house is better than the other one.
I'm sure Tom did it.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm at the end.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun and the night shine.
No one's getting fired.
There's no one else.
When I was traveling to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I don't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom caught the fog.
They tied my eyes.
Do we really want to help them?
He who pays the bills is entitled to master.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, get me some meat.
When will you visit us?
Every day there are tragedies.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening well.
Give me those leaves.
You can take mine.
Tom won't like it.
All comments are excessive.
Did you do this for me?
Can you call them for help?

It's loud in here.
What can we do?
I guess you found him.
Don't take that too literally.
Tom's pretty talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.

Now I'm gonna go look for Tom.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This is going to work for now.
They need to talk.
That's not exactly how it happened.
It's not that you were wrong.
Tom just listened.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
There's no life without weight.

If I were you, I'd follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here for a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the gate.
You have to buy them a present.
I'm not quite satisfied with Tom's explanation.
Looks like you're right.
He ran away so they wouldn't catch him.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom's not back yet.
It has a sentimental value.
I asked her to play with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
We need to set up a trap.
Tom's parking, he'll be here soon.
Love me a little, love me a long time.
Tom's in the living room and he's watching cartoons with the kids.

Tom calls Mary.
Tom's not generous.
You can't prove anything.

Don't you panic?
We should do this again sometime.
I think Tom's sensitive.

It's easy for me to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.

Doesn't sound like he knows what.
Tom tried to escape.
I've got a cat swelling.
The crowd was picking up.
I'm letting the kids grow on the edge.
I think Tom's evil.
The door was locked.
I'll catch your daughter.
I'll call a few people.
Now what are you looking at?
We've been informed.
I was too tired to keep going.
It's got its own sound.
What the doctor thinks is wrong.
Tom will forgive you.

He's writing on his forehead.
Last night, I got a call from a man named Tom Jackson.

The forest was very peaceful.
I have to go back for them.
I don't want to go shopping today.
Tom's intrusive.
Most of the clothes Europeans wear are made out of Europe.
Tom is still busy.
Why do I have to fight?
We can search the Internet.
When I was younger, I always traveled by bus.
I couldn't tell you exactly what the problem was.
Maybe Tom will object.
It's so obvious that we don't need any evidence.
I bought a pair of shoes.
How negative you are.
We haven't found Tom yet.
I need the Internet.
My wallet's in my pocket.
We have something to show you.
Can we wait here?
When I wet, there's something like a moustache.
You beat her.
The stars appeared.
Where's our money?
The Internet isn't your personal army.
I often play a fight.
Where's the blouse I bought you?
That'll teach them in a row.
I have to sit down, my soul is in my nose.
Why do you like it?
Camoli, if I had enough money to buy a house like that.

We're ready to fight.
I advise you to listen to your doctor.

Someone told me that.
You're beautiful.
Get out of here.
Tom refused to leave.
Do you have some time?
I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I eat something?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I won't bother you.
Stay here and keep her safe.

How are you gonna get away?
Let's start with this wine.
My leg's broken.
How are you gonna do that?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd like to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who ever met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
That's exactly what happened to a good friend of mine.
I've got these moustaches from my grandmother.
I don't have a drinking problem.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I was wondering who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's the wrong thing.
He's in great shape.
I grabbed Tom for a lactate.
Mary wants fashion and makeup.
I haven't heard from them.
I have to help them.
Is he far from here?
I can't die here.

I think I'm wrong.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be true.
You look imaginary.
Didn't I warn you about her?
Let's start with Tom.

It's happening.
The door will wake the baby.
I'm late for spanach.
You know what happened?
Stop talking about me.

I'm a fool to believe them.
Tom might need some help.
They went to worship every day.
Tom was a teacher.

When did the war end?
Did the soda machine work?
Tom's a married man.
As Tom said, the soup is frozen.
I missed a lot?
Why didn't you stop?
Are you coming out?

Did you bring the fan?
What Tom did was a mistake.
That's huge.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do what you want.
Can I handle that?
We could talk about Tom.
What's this about?
You're gonna have to study better next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There's algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.

Why are we stopping?
Wow!
I should have asked them first.
Tom may be a little fat.
I'd rather die than grant you my request.

Where was he born?
Tom got two places.
I'll send you the recipe.
It'd look good.
I'll get the guns.
Choose what you like most.

It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He can't focus on his academic work.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
They've become dependent.
I just want money.
I'm not saying sloppy things about their kids.
I want to know why you and Tom don't agree.
I've been completely healed.
I was the only one who knew where Tom was going.
How hard was Tom hurt?
Was he sympathetic?
The book you gave me is very interesting.
It's an honor.
Every time something unusual happens, they blame me.
Tom refuses to work.
What could that mean?
I'm sick of being called a liar.
The beggars can't pick it up.
Is there sugar?

I'm back by bus.
That's how we do it.

I'll never work for them.
Tom's not kidding.
Did you touch anything?
Let's do it now and then.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
You've had a ride, but you're gonna be okay.
You think what you want.
Where I can find a hospital.
Don't ruin the party.

How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, I didn't mean that!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I can't believe I bought this.
He saved the sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier this morning.
Get up once, you lazy bastard!
How long ago was it?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd have avoided Tom for a while.
I won't wait to find out.
Let's keep talking outside.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
The doctor checked Tom to find out there were no internal injuries.

Tom's listening.
Does anyone hear me?
How are you holding up?
Tom didn't know this.
I want to fuck her.
I can come tomorrow.
When did it happen?
I've fallen in love with you.
Tom's in his bedroom and he's talking on the phone.
It was hard for us.
Hurry up and pray.
I'm guilty.
The dog should be on the chain.
I'd rather go alone.
It was one of them.
I want to go to bed and get some rest.
Tom's in the hospital and he's recovering from what he's overdressed.
He broke the tail with his teeth.
I can't believe we were ready to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
She didn't hit him but me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom and Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They seem busy today.
I'm sure Tom was never in Boston.
I think I should look at Tom.
Just do all you can.

Tom's unreliable.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the cup cap up.
That's good training.

I've been living here for years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for my favorite.
I know you've done your best.

When did they move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know both of them.
I need to feel sorry for them.
I don't appreciate it.
Is there a problem?
Shut the door.
We were so worried.
I'm not commenting on the articles.
You'll be my guests.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
This is really a ball.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make an appointment.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Take care of Tom.
It's just words.
There was a short silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met in Boston last year.
Tom's too much of a dog.
No one's walking in Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was hurrying to catch the bus.
I didn't care.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was unbearable.
I agree with this plan.
Justice is expressed through deeds.
I don't know if you know or not, but here in America, you're expected to leave a kiss to the waiter.

That'd be okay.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
Go as long as you can.
Tom was a little uncomfortable about Mary.
I don't need them.

Pray for her.
Will you wait a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at the banner on the square.
Didn't anybody tell you you didn't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I feel it in your touch.
She fell from the tree.
Tom told Maria he never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Tell me if you catch a boy.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can't see him.
I'm coming.
I was in half-son.
Don't expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the good things and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom will be mad.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I've been bitten by something.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I was staring at the man.
Watch out for Tom.
They look familiar to me.
We have a job for them.
All my dreams will come true.
The river passes through the valley.
Get in touch with her.

The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in the fish.
I want you to be with me.
I want to play golf.
Tom is deeply interested in the history of art.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.
Tom didn't see it.
Did you at least get some sleep?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we're gonna have a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new in town and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in a closed room.
His concert was great.
No answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy his picture.
This is really easy.
Are you going on foot?
You should try it.
You're heavy enough to worry.
I don't think Tom's gonna help us much.
Tom seems worried.
I'm taking care of him.
Tom's great.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
Tom's getting close.
Tom seems shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom's sympathetic.
Let it be short, Tom.
Tom called to ask if there was any way to help.
We could have done it.
It's not nobody's fault.
I don't like the taste of chromium.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're late.
Tom's been running away for a while.
Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer than yesterday.
It must have been created from somewhere.
The weekend was fully equipped, with pool, chess, football field and pool table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all pioneers.
I'll see you again.
We were so young then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
While eating pizza, he was bored with his sister.
We should've given up before.
That's close enough.
Tom's polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My old job was crazy.
"Why are you doing this?" "I can do it."
You're such a pig.
Lock the door.
Tom lets the heat go.
We're all the same.
I want to be next to you.
I think we're close to the solution.
You're not that horrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds quite acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was honest and trustworthy and the other was unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not gonna kneel.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I won't forget.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it in a butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would you believe them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two kinds in Ireland.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So what can I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed and he's on the phone.
These are wonderful.
Tom's got his hands busy.
Tom was very upset.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a traitor.
Where did Tom work?
I need to be proud of them.
The noise disturbed the city.
Anyone who wants flowers can't be a bad person.
This isn't bullshit.
They're getting closer.
You're mean.
Did you hand over Tom's note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have little breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom's on his way.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She's always wearing an attack suit.
Tom was a boss.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about that.
Women don't love you.
It's time to get up.
This isn't your problem, it's mine.
Before I lay down, I drank three pills against the cold.
Maybe Tom's wrong.
They might need help.
I don't have any vodka.
Tom's acting like a dehydrated brat.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We need to ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
Do you want movies?
Time is forever.
First of all, you don't have the right to make conclusions, second of all, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
In the audience, apparently, it's boring.
I'm raising goods.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to borrow her keys.
Tom's got a mustache.
There was a war going on.
And did Tom participate?
The thief turned into a cop.
We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll change my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and repulsive.
Camoli, if I could help you more.
Tom's gone.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the building's facade, and when I passed by her with a car, I didn't recognize her.
Is it all possible to have this?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting around the floor.
Tom, forget about it.
Invite him to join us.
It won't be easy to do that without much help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works in a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
- Come on, sit down.
This isn't about the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She looked like she was deeply shocked by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we're not careful, we're going to have to do the same.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom was coming from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'll get divorced.
That dinner.
My toodle's coming in.
You're gonna have a fight.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geese pour out the hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You don't suggest we give Tom all the money, do you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm here by my will.
It's to protect you.
I've always had someone to help me.
They don't want it.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He says he wants to see you.
He was right, Tom.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get any of them?
Can you connect to him?
Tom said if he wins the lottery, he'll buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I don't care about math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to older people.
Precious stones include the aquarium, the amethyst, the emerald, the quartz, and the ruby.
Go find them.
You've got to ask your mother for permission before.
I'll take Tom's place.
What happened to you coming to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom offended Mary.
I know I packed it.
You want the chickens a lot.
It was a wonderful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I had lunch fast.
Tom remembered various things that no one else remembered.
You can easily distinguish them.
I'm gonna go look for her.
Of all the languages I've learned, my French was the easiest.
Tom wrote the house.
I counted up to 200.
Watch this.
Shall I go?
A boy looks like a monkey.
The peppers are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did you want?
We've got a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you borrow the money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project doesn't go well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea specifically.
Can I make a statement?
They were all so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'll lose everything.
I need food.
Tom showed up to Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I have homework.
He was breathing deep.
That's terrible.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman's easily embarrassed.
Did he get there by car?
I think I might be able to help her.
I'll do the right thing.
Tom has a lot of time.
I'll be fine.
I hit something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom was always poor.
It's a beautiful alka.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was mad at Mary.
Was he alone at home?
He made a lot of money out of her.
Can you help me solve that?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to return to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it on your own?
I'm gonna go find another one.
I'm hungry.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make spiders.
You really talk a lot.
It may be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
Tom doesn't always have to believe what the other guy says.
He's in love with his head up to five.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter is not married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom's chest of pain.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're upset!
It seems to me that this is the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what to do when I'm retired.
Tom recognized Mary's manuscript.
I think you've helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom knows how to do everything.
The sound soon died.
Who fryed you?
I don't really understand it myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how to dress palm trees.
How do you know about him?
Just keep going.
Tom's a good friend, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How's Tom coming in?
There's someone on the threshold.
Tom wasn't getting away.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try to call her.
It was a great day.
It was a wonderful night.
I think it's possible for me to pee.
You're free.
Peter may need a new coat.
How's Tom at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom doesn't talk to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom wants to swim.
I'll yell.
I'm not a jockey to you.
What's our situation?
Do you want me to keep it?
You're a real freezer.
Boston is a beautiful place.
Who's responsible?
I'm serious.
I think it's better if we don't drink water.
No one's talking.
What did you get to contact them?
Nothing can be done.
Do you have anything?
It's not cold at all.
Will you do the same?
He had witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don't want to be treated differently than before.
It's supposed to be okay.
I respected the rules.
Tom's a widow.
I think Tom's inhaled.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
You already did that.
You're poor.
Give me another shirt.
Many Russians were killed while taking pictures of themselves with their phones.
He believes that the old newspapers are still useful.
I want them to invite me.
We see who laughs, but not who weeps.
How old are you, Tom?
He was wearing red scarves around his neck.
The girl didn't say anything.
It was getting dark.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He relaxes listening to music.
Try the shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did Tom say he was going to start his party?
This obviously was Tom's hard decision.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
Dan was doing his job very well.
My legs still hurt.
I would do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I've passed out.
It's hard to assess his ability.
That's good.
I know the husband sitting there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't do this to me.
I'm open to everything.
I've been watching you before.
Stop where they are.
Are you her leader?
"She wants music, doesn't she?" "Yes, she does."
The barber's drying it up.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm gonna lose.
Her sister gave her an injection against the flu.
Did you try to talk to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom hasn't stayed here for a long time.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell out of the rock while he cleaned his pants.
Do you have anything to add, Tom?
Quiet, fool!
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Damascus is in Syria.
All the compositions were good except yours.
I don't think Tom will be at school tomorrow.
Please, this way.
We'll wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
Next year, my birthday will fall in a week.
Everyone laughed.
Did Tom look happy?
Who wrote these messages?
Tom's making cracks.
Tom's breathing deep.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to this cave?
Dan didn't want to go to the orphanage again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
You'll never know.
I still think about him.
I thought it was causing me.
Tom seems lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one came.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it if you don't show him.
You bought Mary something.
There's nothing more like a lunatic than a drunk.
Take Tom.
Tom started taking off his clothes.
I know Tom times.
It looks nice.
We stopped in Boston.
This almost works.
I can't concentrate on all of this.
Split the cards, Tom.
The thugs tied his mouth.
Smile at him.
This medicine will ease the pain.
I'd like to congratulate you on dinner.
Can't he wait for that?
They'll pay for their pride.
Dan didn't miss any episodes of that soap.
I love peppers.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We have a few questions to ask you, Tom.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I hate her as much as you do.
We can get you some help.
I heard him.
We're investigating the entire area.
Don't forget Tom still loves you.
Tom told me I'd like to visit him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna miss everyone.
Here we are.
Why are they doing this?
I studied at the university for four years, and I got nothing but a poor degree.
This is priceless.
Do you want to draw?
It was pretty disgusting.
Tom's listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're together again.
After the fire, it's just ashes.
Tom wants some kind of vegetable except for a plant.
Try to put yourself in his skin.
Tom used to write poems.
We'll take Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm ready to make up for it.
People can't create miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to exclude him from their company.
Those who mix the verbatim endings "-steet" and "-zeit" are waiting for a special place in hell.
What happened next?
You know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like there's them everywhere.
I didn't count on that.
I was a badass.
I saw Tom just last week.
It shouldn't take us a long time.
I'm trying not to dry up.
Tom's got to clean up.
We're very angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everybody knows how to drive.
Tom shuts down two pipes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom didn't leave a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish speakers all month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You made something.
It's really bad.
Do you want a cough?
They say the blue ducks contain a lot of nicotine.
Looks like I'm feeling a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't want surprises.
My wife is modest and devout.
I'll take it to Tom.
I don't think I can pass the test.
I think we'll join.
Tom went ahead.
Tom's holding his car.
You're interesting.
This time I can win.
All the people on earth came from a common ancestor.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I don't.
I'm having fun.
We all have to go find Tom.
I'm fine.
Do you need help with this?
Tom, your patent's open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom doesn't go to the market.
I came to get him a present.
I asked her to describe it.
I just had a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What is she?
Can people really be so foolish to think that the entire population of Georgia, speaking the Caucasian language without any common backgrounds or common English letters, can completely conquer the English for just two years?
I'm just guessing.
Tom doesn't want milk.
Our attempts were empty.
There are too many things I don't know.
He had respiratory problems.
Tom's good at tennis.
Berlin is very cold.
I'm the lunatic.
Tom was laughing.
You miss Boston?
I think you should call him.
Every student has his own locker.
Tom's not my type.
These are for them.
Do you really have to work this weekend?
What's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I got something for him.
How do I know if Tom's the real one for me?
Tom is studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that sound beautiful?
This isn't Tom's first delay.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students are gone.
You've done so much.
Kate is very charming.
Where did you go?
Your path is hard.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom took his flute and started to play.
Tom wants to be rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Get him out of the mess.
Blood flows through the blood vessels.
You're borrowing books.
I can barely move.
Tom was wondering how good a singer Mary was.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not musical, but I'm singing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing a fight.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
What didn't help us?
I really want to learn French.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan learned the hard way.
You showed them the falsification of my friends.
I give my employees the right to leave early.
Are you here alone?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
The cat's on the roof.
What's in that closet?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too low.
I'm sorry.
What books do you need?
Tom asked me if I liked Boston or not.
I don't like big dogs.
I'm thirsty.
He ate the salad from the cellar.
I'm going to run.
Tom's got some gum.
I want to buy you a present.
It's stuck.
Tom had never visited Boston.
It's nice to be independent.
Tom's quite popular.
I have a big family.
Now no one can help me.
I'm glad you came back.
I'll get some ice.
Come and look.
Do you think you're cute?
Innocentness is most often a blessing, not a virtue.
Tom's pulsed.
There's a restaurant nearby, but it's not very good.
That mistake is very common.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
He kept stealing about how her boyfriend had been kind, compassionate, courageous, and yet not known.
Did you lie to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
Tom trusts Mary.
You were busy.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks to the victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom's watching TV.
I don't know why I always have to be me.
They stopped going.
That's not a mistake.
I saw the sponge in the mine.
I was born in 1980.
Tom loves his life.
The shape of the skull is different from that of different people.
I've become uncomfortable with heteroormatic propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't hold it for a long time.
You're getting better by yourself a reward.
That whole thing makes sense.
I'll open your door.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked you how you were.
I don't know how to behave here.
We need to get on TV.
Tom's insatiable.
They won't help you.
I feel great.
They're not there.
Nothing's right with me.
They have a good appetite this morning.
The old man made a hole in the wall.
Tom hated us.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You should be happy for them.
This priest is very hard.
Tom stopped crying.
All these things are waiting for me.
Is it a real diamond?
You know I don't eat meat.
It seems very sleepy.
I prepared a cake yesterday with mushrooms.
I hope it works.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Tom won't be home for lunch.
Is there a reward?
Believe in science!
Although the rainy worm also owns male and female reproductive systems, it needs another individual to fertilize.
The failure shamed Lisa.
I heard he got sick, Tom.
Tom passed out.
Don't smoke in here.
Does Tom have a key?
I'm going right now.
Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
It is assumed that the sun’s surface temperature is about 6,000 degrees Celsius.
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
The crowd is freaking out.
Tom started working.
Tom wanted Mary to buy John's birthday present.
Cover it.
The police are looking for them.
How deep is the cave?
The bread is fresh out of the oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'll get Tom to examine him.
That was a shame.
I need Tom's address.
That's kind of sad.
I just didn't trust her.
It's possible Tom left.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did Tom want to eat?
I got Tom's keys.
Tom refused.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's ten o'clock.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen years old.
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
Do you know a lot about us?
Someone killed Tom.
Tom wasn't impressed.
That was really bad.
This must be yours.
We're here in time.
I was kind of sorry for you.
Cigarettes are sneaky for adults.
Tom and Mary left handprints in the liquid cement.
Cavaler would never do anything like that.
I love them.
Did you try hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was ridiculous.
This is wonderful.
Tom, don't do this to Tocho.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there any food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I'd say no.
No one deserves to die.
Then I didn't know what that meant.
Tom never lost hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
In what situations would he do that?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the goldsmiths.
Fortunately, the shed was stable, otherwise the storm would have destroyed it the other night.
I heard they caught her.
Tom's been written down somewhere.
There's no good news.
And who do you work for these days?
I'll give it up.
Mary’s eyes were filled with pleasure.
It's evil to sow.
I only have one minute.
Tom never gives up.
I think Tom's conservative.
How much do you guys have?
I'd like a piece of pie.
I'm tired of your ongoing complaints.
Don't you care what's going to happen to Tom?
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's making herself mysterious.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too soon.
You scared her.
Tom cheated on us.
What was I talking about?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The salesman cheated on him.
It's all in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.
I paid the penalty.
I want to know who that phone call was from.
Were you home at ten?
It's closed today.
Please let Tom know.
I'll get her to help you.
I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.
I was thinking about you.
Where could Tom be?
Tom's on his way to Boston.
I have plans for dinner with Tom.
She made me tea.
It's just a job.
I hear there's a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and came to address her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
Would you like to go to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I look forward to seeing Dad's new version.
It looks pointless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why don't you sing?
Did Tom really do that?
I didn't know how to play basketball at all.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
Tom doesn't be a sport.
I'm dangerous, Tom.
I don't see anything.
Call your horses.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt very lonely.
I want to try new things.
Tom wasn't the only survivor after the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom doesn't laugh.
I started seeing him.
We'll hurry up.
You haven't eaten yet?
Tom found me a cab.
He did a miracle.
Irons are laxatives of chemical substances in the body.
That wasn't my idea.
Tom's resting.
Don't run around.
It would be best if you didn't talk that much.
This is a new model.
I've been providing help.
Music unites.
This is just a simulation.
I'm glad to see you, Tom.
I kind of felt sorry for her.
He's too generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bike.
Why do the rabbits have big ears?
Come here!
You could've refused.
Why wouldn't you let me help?
It'll happen soon.
Hey, it's suctiony here, get me out before I sneez.
It's gonna happen what's gonna happen.
I heard that story.
There's still darkness out there.
That's what Tom wanted to say.
Is Tom there?
I'll find her.
The police found nothing to link Dan to the robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers were from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Julia.
We need to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom was acting decently.
I guess I'll have to wait a little longer.
You can leave and stay as you like.
This is your wine.
I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you talk to me on your own?
Where's the meeting going?
Let's play real or challenge.
His conclusions are based on unproven assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom started to list the book.
That's the real reason.
Tom likes flowers a lot.
Tom told Mary to be careful.
I fainted.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very kind.
You know who I am?
Why don't you listen?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a song of cheese for me.
I don't want you to put yourself in danger.
I'm fat.
How long have you been in front of a computer?
My wife's getting sucked out of the day's routine.
I want to know how you did it.
Ambients are single cell organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long have you been to Boston?
Tom pulled my hand.
You're crazy!
How late was the train?
Let's park there.
That's very stupid.
It was hot yesterday, but today it's more durable.
I'm cold.
You were going in front of me.
Give it back to me.
He's breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This isn't fair to me.
Maybe someone followed them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
That's so boring.
The kid kept all the money in his wallet.
Come to know her.
They laughed.
I'd like to hear from him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This won't work.
He's gone soon.
The children were so excited about the party that they couldn't sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel very guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You beat me.
Do you think we'll get to the station in time?
Everything seemed fine.
The mother was cruel to her adoptee.
The international language would be of great use to mankind.
I gave them help.
Have you decided yet?
Dan asked Linda to sleep with him.
Tom didn't lie to me at all.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
You can't just leave the baby.
Tom has mental problems.
Tom started eating.
She's kind.
What time is it?
Nice weekend.
Do you want some gas?
Tom stabbed the girls.
We've been looking so hard.
Tom seems different today.
Throw them out of the deck.
Japan as a country has many different features.
It's disturbing.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
The nuns used to play tennis on the monasteries.
Don't be so pervert!
Tom wants proof.
We didn't come here for them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your salary.
I'm sorry, I called the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom's got little hands.
I'm worried.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The test included mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
Tom's a couple.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
Well, didn't you say you know how to swim?
Don't pressure Tom.
They betrayed me.
And he's missing the paper.
Tom doesn't know how to express himself.
Attend the meeting.
I'll find a picture of how you kept your speech.
This sentence has five words.
He was eating lamb's creams, potatoes, and mushroom soup for dinner.
We waited outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier this way.
Tom lied to you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom's doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not an option.
How old were you when you got divorced?
The French is heavy.
I rarely ask questions.
You're a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor's checking the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.
The smoke is in the air.
The printer's not working.
I'll send you to the door.
It's dark here.
Tom's a bully.
This was too much for her.
Tom was wondering what would happen if he pressed the blue button.
If you see Tom, could you give him this?
We can order pizza.
Tom's much better.
I just want to talk to Tom.
The prince is handsome.
We're drinking water.
Maybe we should stop.
Mary was representing her team at the game.
Tom doesn't want a party.
It looks like eggs.
I just want to visit Tom.
I'm one.
We don't want any new accidents.
There's no way he was Tom.
I'll kill you.
Most people have strong resistance to getting up early, even when they have to.
Give me the gloves.
I watched Tom.
Who's there with you?
What are you so excited about?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom's gone mad.
It wasn't very good.
Engineers should be able to understand in oil and engine subsampling.
How was it yesterday?
You have to learn valuable.
We can't let them go.
They have families.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's have breakfast.
I'm sucking my omelet.
Tom and explain to Mary the rules in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
You're gonna get hurt, aren't you?
I totally forgot about him.
An interesting question remained unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I pulled my knife out.
They danced.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I'm lying down in ten and a half.
I don't know where it went.
There's a boy running to me.
Tom now seems very tired.
I'll follow your instructions.
I put it together.
Tom stayed calm.
You said you'd help.
The cells are the basic components of living creatures.
They're having fun.
I should go change my clothes.
How long do you work as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Chukunbaba died one day after my older sister was born.
He's been wandering for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom's almost lost in the crowd.
As far as you know, I don't care.
No, I'm still a knight.
This is hard for me.
Now how do you feel about her?
Don't surprise me.
That surprised me.
This is what we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn to the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why are you getting married when we kiss?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I was wrong to judge her.
It'll be over soon enough.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom's screaming.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He knows how to play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the seminary.
It's not too early.
Can I eat?
They painted the frames of the yellow windows.
Tom, are you in there?
You can use this car.
Nice to meet you.
It's like I'm crying.
We have to wait here.
Is everything all right with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing his blood.
I have to stay here.
Everything or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
No one's talking about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
You and I will fly the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom doesn't listen.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at the auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour to the event.
You were amazing.
I won't give up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird lifted the branch with the clone and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to go.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
It depends whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man three years ago.
They all laughed at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom's unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to take the time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell are you buying?
Tom was struggling to get rid of himself.
What am I gonna do with them?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not the right time now.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot more than I thought it would.
Tom's running by Mary.
A cat scratched me.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is how Tom did it.
I swear it was them.
Did you have a swim suit?
His nose's the best.
Now I can't ask them.
Tom's got defensive hair.
Long live the USSR!
He's hot.
I want to buy pineapple.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's just a question.
The bush is burning.
Tom was affected.
I'm being bitten by conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
The frogs are wonderful creatures.
There are three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom's drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're getting a lot of shit.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's doing something.
You should've asked her first.
Tom's got a scar on his face.
Don't you believe us?
I respect you.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was the trip nice?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth after each meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom's got his heart.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed out.
This is the king's most trusted adviser.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change your clothes.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else am I gonna get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you could possibly imagine.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a handcuff.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He's changing things.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom kept climbing.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that?
What did they find?
You lied to me in your eyes.
I'll go find her.
I wanted to change.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware Tom did that.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
They would've just stopped Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I've learned it by no means.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach so they spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on strike.
He's a little deaf, that's according to his speech.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's you for now.
That's a very surrogate explanation.
The breakfast snacks are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them on their own.
Wasn't it horrible?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his harsh attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We all want to see the movie.
It's simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom wore his shirt once.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
The evening was really good!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and division is not.
I'm kidding.
Tom took the hat off and gave it to him.
We're losing oil.
I don't think Tom will go.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what it says in today’s newspapers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom's drinking from three to six coffees a day.
Tom was loud.
It was better.
Tom started screaming.
I'll ask you to stay for a while.
We're hearing two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone showed up for her.
Maybe Tom will die by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was furious.
This Limenka is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to be hearing about Tom for the first time?
Tom put his hand down.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
My money has swallowed my glasses.
So it wasn't.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's the fact.
We all fancied for her.
Didn't you see the Alo flag?
Get off me!
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I think I found one of those.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom's been without food all week.
I don't understand.
Although I am a pious man, I am a man.
Tom's sorry he's late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't get so angry.
A lot of people are hunting.
He deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you?
Where did we go?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We need to look into something.
Tom open his eyes.
They can't go out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are you doing?
Tom was drinking quietly.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary shut it up.
We met in a maean.
How was Tom?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole city looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The drug must be drunk on an empty stomach.
Tom's not involved.
Looks like our job is not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
My curve's down.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you eternal bread.
The pig from the marzipan doesn't get fat.
Tom's awake.
Tom pissed Mary off.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
That's what Tom's doing.
Tom might be here today.
Tom doesn't differ between reality and fantasy.
Tom's a hero.
Tom has no power at all.
Will you help me?
Don't let me down.
Tom wasn't home when I came home.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Come on, now.
You better die on your feet than live on your knees.
They dig a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I've been home all night.
We got out of there at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that much money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
You only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it's from another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the time?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've made it up yet.
Each member must be present.
She didn't understand the joke.
This is the deepest snow I've ever seen.
She's hoping to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you understand his name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
It's made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagrees with Mary on the subject.
You're right.
I'll go.
Today is my sixteenth birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy gifts?
You two are very sweet together.
You're beautiful.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What's the luck?
Dan wounded Linda's dog.
You missed your key bone while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blinding.
Do you really believe this guy is a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was ingenious.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict veganza diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please inform them.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I had anything to cook.
Keep an eye on the road.
We're gonna stop by the way.
I heard Tom cry.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerves on that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
It's time to close.
Let go of me.
The stone went down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom's crazy.
Come on again!
Don't make his heart.
You don't have to comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin's very sweet.
You're a jerk.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was all right here.
They look delicious.
I could make things easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I'd never get out of the house by the papyrus.
I think Tom's a cepide.
He's sick of a terrible infection and the ovary's flow.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't do.
He's not coming to consider.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's always acting weird.
We're gonna hang them.
Now is probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was very stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incapacitated.
Tom bought two tickets and a cup of popcorn.
You're powerful.
I got a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we make a cupcake?
I need a secretary.
This girl's the smartest.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him right away.
Hold on to the subject.
She really wants to talk.
I've got questions on a ton.
This is an interesting, funny, even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language is different in the world.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pajamas on.
This way.
This is the Holy Land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday's in July.
We have everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he doesn't know how to play tennis.
Where did you find her, live?
This was at the top of the pile.
I'm done with it.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't talked to me since we broke up.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found another one.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's hot enough for the decoy?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you nervous about it?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling.
I've lost my sense of time.
This island is an American territory.
Put 'em where you are.
Do you want to meet him?
I burned the cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are gathered in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I'd do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You took off your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little smug.
