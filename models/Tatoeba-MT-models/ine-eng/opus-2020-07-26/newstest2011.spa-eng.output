What is it? The ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the pastry
The new councillors of ČSSD in the capital will seem to have to overcome the clear language barriers for the members of the Prague Board and the Municipal Council to understand their renewed companions of the ODS.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the marked slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled in Prague.
The coded dictionary that used Prague's flower and birth policy during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Well, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been proved that the new councillors do not understand these well-known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is I don't know."
"I'm rather an innovation in Prague politics," said during the examination of the terminology of "college" the cultural councillor Lukaš Kaucký.
And with regard to the political veteran, Karel Brézina reacted similarly.
Maybe they know the concept of golf.
"Maybe the only expression of all that you asked me to use from time to time."
"If not, usually no slang job."
From the glossary, whose definitions were published in Aktuálně.cz last June prior to the ODS vote congress, the editorial chose six examples, in particular those specifically related to the Prague municipal authorities.
Socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "largest golf hole in Prague", "go to the pastry", "trouble nut", "traition of capital" and "blind".
Three councillors agreed to the test and a room, Antonín Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused to do so directly.
"I don't put myself in these things, and I don't think I value how the citizens of democracy have fun."
"What I do care about is how we understand the implementation of our programmes," he said.
As has been seen, the conceivator Lukaš Kaucký would not have realized that the previous title is an expression of an influential businessman and a friend of the high mayor Ben, Roman Janousek.
Kaucký's word "Voldemort" doesn't say anything; the only term that he did in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, who immediately adds, "But I know it for the news."
"I'm going to have to point to a language course," she jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf hole the Blanka tunnel, but also the environmental counselor Lukaš Plachý.
Then both socio-democratics know who Voldemort and Lukas Plachý really are, even know where to find that character; in addition, suspect the meaning of "go to the pastry".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; it is soon revealed to Plachý that it is the headquarters of Janousek companies.
Like Brzezina, it indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the socio-democratics there is no so familiar glossary of colloquial terms.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really doesn't seem like we have anything like it."
"Well, amongst us we use apos, sometimes abbreviations or play word games with names," says the president of the ČSSD Prague, Petr Hulinský, whose party companions are called Hulda.
"In college they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my companions call me that," confesses her own apodo Karel Březina.
The paper Aktuálně.cz tested the name and works.
For his party companions, Weinert es Děda (like "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the misleading elections during the party's sponsorship, receives the apodo of "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of his companions.
The apods are also the only expressions that socio-democratics tolerate in speech within the party.
Hullínský does not like to call it Hulda, but Aktuálně.cz also discovered other apodos for this Prague president.
"The Doctor of the Rights of the Pigs" seems to recall that Petr Hulinský obtained his doctorate in Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of "bruges", as published in a leaflet
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They usually have an advanced age, they can't work, for example, for health reasons, they're single and they don't have children.
Witches who "feel" are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the people.
"Men rarely suffer from such a seal."
"You don't go to healthy young women either, because they help in work and have children," a nun explains, who, in the capital of West Africa state Burkina Faso, deals in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information leaflet that should help to avoid the hunting of witches.
However, this has a grip.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso don't know how to read," warns the Die Standard newspaper on the disadvantages of writing sensitization.
The allegations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbor of Burkina Faso, Amy Hemmah died 72 last week, when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate set of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was taken in the oil used for ritual weddings.
He was caught in flames when the group wanted to "evict the evil spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of the "bruges" supports people from all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "The devourers of human souls always represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the Government was trying to calm down the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"The Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a large hunt of witches who allegedly had been related to his death and tried to kill his own president by means of black magic."
"In order to help him bring the bells from nearby Guinea that, protected by police, military and the President's personal hearing, were taken to the force of randomized men and women among the Gambian peoples to the ownership of the President in Kanilai," the International Amnesty Organization said in its report.
In the camp, the arrested people had to drink a few herbs with hallucinogenic effects that also caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the detainees did not survive the camp.
After the international pressure, they finally released about a thousand persons detained.
The Bacala rental: it is heated with carbon stoves and signed a higher rental
The man, aged and retired, crossed the doors of the care centre to the customer of the RPG Byty company of the "carbon trap" Zdeněk Bacala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried documents with the new three-bed rental contracts: his, his daughter and his son, who is executing judgment.
The three have just taken the liberalisation of the rentals.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns per month, the child will pay 4,100 crowns from next year for a two-bedroom apartment with separate second category kitchen.
"In addition, there is no hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," he shows with his finger the man in his son's new contract, on which the firm has full powers.
"But I signed it," she explains, half angry, half resigned.
The Civil Society BytyOKD.cz, which has qualified the new conditions for rent as "inadvertent and inadvertent", recommends that tenants who do not sign the new contracts wait until 7 December, the date on which a guide will be published informing about how to proceed in these cases.
But before this, man only makes an adman.
"Each one says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory of tests for liberalisation.
After New Year, it will take place with the vast majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mine waiting room is one of the four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday to nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to pick up a number.
"Render 2011", can be read on a bright button of your touch screen.
When you press it, get out of the machine a paper with a number.
Almost doesn't give time or read "157" and the number appears on the large screen at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Shortly thereafter, an elderly couple comes to ask, but the crowd in the room isn't here for the new tenants.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as old-fashioned requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar issues.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava in the pockets of the tenants of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes an increase in the rental of between 15 and 38% in the cards.
On 18 November, a special window is opened in the customer care centre for new rentals.
"He's been working for a week, so he's starting," they say, after a short doubt, the workers who are in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and the former Bacala miners' floors are the most sensitive themes in the area.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament, from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, from ČSSD, has dealt with them very clearly and consistently in the newspapers of the area.
"I want a new land 20 years later."
"I didn't change the fucking bath dish," the man mentioned in the introduction is dismissed.
According to the workers, for the time being, more than nothing retired comes to check if they receive a discount in the rental if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before 15 December will also receive half of the discount on the rental of February.
However, the window of the mining "liberalization" is no doubt unable to unravel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked for the rental in 2011 about forty or fifty people", estimated the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and in its tables to hold individual meetings on contracts where necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rental, an independent judge shall resolve the matter.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed and fully in accordance with the law," RPG warns on its pages.
"No one is going to be judged here," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man who is on the street in front of the customer's attention center gives at least in part the reason.
"I get a 13,000 pension and I have 5,000 left for food; I don't have the means to go to the courts," he says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubts.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns you in the media that they don't sign, so perhaps people are waiting," he says.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"Current rentals still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," remembers Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the community fund facing the tenants is, for owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years that passed between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in apartments four billion, the figure will increase to 5,200 million in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
The large screen that grabs from the roof, in front of the sittings of the waiting room, now repeats some data that highlights red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 is 15% and less applies to 31200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be up to 7,50 monthly check crowns per square meter", is indicated on the screen.
Only an increase of 38% of the rent of 400 floors on the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, it is an increase from an extremely low amount of 19,66 crowns per square meter," RPG says.
At 2,600 floors, the rental will remain invariable next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not affect the tenants, but will scale between four and eight years.
In addition, add the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rental lift (see graph) again on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
People signing the rental lift agreement will have priority.
Architects have understood that offices also need care
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides within it a small garden with all of its own to such facilities: colour walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outside terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can come to her.
Arch.Design, the company of architectural projects, from which many famous Brno buildings came out, thought from the first pieces of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mining.
In the company, about 90 people work, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, the guardship is one of the benefits that Arch offers.Design your workers within your social program.
Constructors and architects thus have the opportunity to combine a demanding profession with child care.
The mining industry was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mining is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme of Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (a grant of over 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to purchase equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified personnel and services.
When the funding is exhausted (two years), Arch.Design has the obligation to keep the mini-garden with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and the company's contribution to the submission of the funding request was Economic Rating.
Children's attention is in the hands of qualified staff; in addition, a nurse and a teacher of the Ministry of Education are present all day long for their care. The ward currently welcomes children with no age limit, although most of them are under three years old.
Since it is a mini-guardery, it can only accommodate up to five children at the same time, although with shifts they go more during the day.
The operation of the ward is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the ward, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the minority programme is comparable to that of the pre-school curriculum.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality education: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach to English.
The class has not only toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of small children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of late collection when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally creates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
Thus, Arch.Design is located amongst companies sign that they offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened the marketing of staff.
The house of the bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. They observe the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like the lome of a prehistoric pond, the stairs remind the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its shape similar to a skeleton, the locals seized "the house of the bones".
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the innovative use of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade that resembles the smoothly curved scales and omnipresent lines, all of which is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with onyric lines, delicate colors and textures extracted from nature and fauna.
By paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought order are observed.
At night, the whole façade of the house seems even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpentea and the twisting of the shapes continue to surprise us also inside.
The wafted wood copies the frames of the windows, the beams, the decorations of the doors, the mirrors and the letters.
The Casa Batlló, located in the Eixample neighborhood in the 43rd of the lively commercial street of Passeig de Gràcia, emerged from the remodeling of a house in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the industrial rich Josep Batlló, initially insisted on breaking down the previous building and starting at zero, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Batlló House, consisting of several apartments, did not design it alone, Antoni Gaudí.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in its plans of the project there were ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the façade.
In the façade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Milá House and Güell Park in Gaudí, where there are other parts of it.
Because of its organic form, the locals soon after its completion seized "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it "the house of the ruins".
It is also said that, above construction, the sword of San Jorge, patron of Catalonia appears.
Other sculptural elements of the building hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for central heating times with ventilation respirators and typical fireplaces.
It may be strange to have a forty-five degree inclination.
During the construction, Gaudí did not comply at all with the building standards of the time and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the construction was granted the permit from the beginning, although it clearly showed that the planned reconstruction data were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the town was so affected by the result that it was requested to be corrected.
For example, he was upset that the construction included columns even to the public side.
The arrangements were never made, rather than the contrary: only fifteen days after the city's request, Joseph Batlló requested permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself was installed on the lower floors.
In the gallery of the second floor there were the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The house, with six floors, is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform were to break all right angles and lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the rooms and a larger group can be communicated in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy required for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only obtained a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white blues and blues that cover the inner courtyard and tragaluces.
The game with both colors brings the maximum light on all the floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which otherwise absorb the sun's rays.
Anyone can visit the Batlló House, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and recharged apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits, they confirmed, or discovered, that it was a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and to the bush, including the roof terrace.
The price of entrance to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches EUR 16.50, although students, pensioners and card holders get 20% discount.
The amount exceeds significantly the price of entry of other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real environment of the bed with its pond towers, you should quickly make friends with some neighboring residents and visit them at home.
How to choose the sleep and sleep: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pumping frame for the bed; what really gives its quality to a good bed is the surface to fall, i.e., the bed and sleep.
First of all, they must be complemented by perfection in order to adapt to specific users.
During the election, many elements come into play, including the weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
It is also important for the type of interior in which the bed and somier are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heat, latex mattresses should not be used because they are "heated" more slowly.
In addition, it is often much more difficult than usual polyurethane spoons.
Therefore, it is necessary to give them the most frequent return.
If the central channels are not properly flown and, above, they are on a firm basis, they remain in the humidity. Even a moo may appear below.
When choosing a bed, they also influence the customs.
Those who have spent a long time abroad often use a very high spoon with a soft layer and will have problems feeling well on a lower and hard surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep well here."
"For their shoulders, heels and chairs, they needed mattresses with a soft viscoelastic layer."
"This type of mattresses is also recommended for people with diabetes who have long problems with the nervous system, so they get ill information about the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamchiková, who specializes in the hidden furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, take time preferring viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these right Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropical brand."
You don't have to be a NHL player anymore to be able to appreciate viscoelastics.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimise your stiffness and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapt to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not return as after a hard game.
It just sleeps better.
Viscoelastics also works as a protection against laxatives.
When choosing the size of the spoon, add to its height the length of its feet, i.e., between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, for example single rooms, a minimum of 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
So that a possible visit is also convenient.
"If not, a simple norm can be applied to calculate the width: when you fall mouth up, you should have your hands comfortably picked up towards the codes," advises Engineer Helena Prokopová, expert from Cechu čaluníkov to decoratorů, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and furniture ergonomics for many years, the theme he teaches in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, each one needs his own bedroom and bed, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the beds.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the bearings at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
The foam bearings should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with inner soles a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softness.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you rest in the mattress, you should certainly not notice the muelles," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each bed requires a certain type of sleep.
The fully hidden bedrooms, in which the bed and base are like siamese, have no meaning in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can't wash your ass, which is often done today.
And since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it's clear that after about five or seven years the spoon will start to remind us of a large (and congested) Tamiz.
For this reason, experts reject slogans that speak of a life of up to 25 years of age or, even, of a life guarantee.
However, everything has a pen.
Therefore, the sellers give advice: in mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully take care of the cleaning and washing of the floor, but better add a pillow protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although there are currently carpets made with cremation closures all over its perimeter, so when opening them they remain in two parts (very important for the washing and size of the washing machine!), their handling in models of larger size (and by one person) when lifting the spoon may seem to be a struggle between a muscle weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a dreamer, do you have a firm table?
Never!
Like much for the bed thought to spend one night the visits.
However, you should make (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes in the table and should be used with a spoon with balls inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with balls in bags (such as German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane alloys should not be used on such bases.
For non-alloy blades, which contain between 14 and 18 blades, can be used latex or sandwich blades (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fibre), although it is always better a sommer with a larger number of blades, 28 or more, in which the blades in the lumbar area are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated.
The joint blades should not be used with a spoon of mussels, as they do not react to the reclination.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the blades, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the blades that allows to press or, even, to tilt the blades so that they perfectly "rove" to their shoulders during their sleep.
For men with very broad shoulders, this is something very important.
They are even remembered by colchone manufacturers who, in the "males", began to use a more soft area precisely around their shoulders.
Women are also remembered, for which they place a softer area around the chairs.
For the most demanding customers, there are dreams with cross structure or tables with the so-called multitork amortization.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
It should also be borne in mind that, although it uses the right spoon and somier, if it uses a bad pillow (large and "mold"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic standard is simple: the pillow must support the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of them can be relaxed.
The recommended appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
On the side fall, the cushion must be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder with shoulder reinforcement or the softest area of the shoulder) than the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to see, it seems, with the original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use more and more natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological collions are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, such as rice or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soy.
"Biological, in the case of colchones, means that the centre is only made of natural materials", explains Petr Vaszječek of the Tropico Plus company.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the base of the mattresses, one of the first vera aloe.
But you can also choose from the microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to wood or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with bristle vegetable extracts, so that the bottom of the spoon absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer "heat" the bottom.
Red lead extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel more heat.
Your favorites right now?
The colchons made of cold foam, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, make them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam rigs allows the manufacture of mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality spoon will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as health care.
The first one to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is complicated to save in the hives and smiles.
At times, the offers of manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two spoons at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a foam with memory attached to the bottom by 11,990 crowns.
The second is achieved free of charge.
The era of viscoelastics with an open cell structure and a great density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it emerged as a material for NASA, because during the shootings of astronauts they were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur immerses with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent falls, although also to improve comfort during sleep.
The viscoelastic foam is used not only in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use the Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and similar.
More and more parents use tracking devices to control their children
The fear of children keeps more and more people thinking about controlling them by GPS.
The system, originally designed to track vehicles, can also follow the movement of people and contribute so, for example, in the event of the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device currently has the approximate size of a lockbox, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people were afraid of the missing Anička and began to inform about the means available to protect their children better.
Even at the cost of attacking your privacy.
"We all try to tell ourselves that it is not about spying, but about another way to reduce the possibility of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are put into someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet met with such cases."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
In their view, children should always know what "cajita" is and how it is used in an emergency.
Children's psychologist Dana Bočkova warns about the fact that if the child doesn't want to take it, he'll just pull it off.
"Even younger children show great creativity at the time of intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid controlling them."
"In the past, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," Bočkova says.
In his view, it is questionable if such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
"If it is a prepared kidnapping, the author will practically always check if the child carries some kind of electronic device that can unveil his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices is expanding, you will also search for them, as your sale will undoubtedly be made with much publicity."
"In such cases, criminals always go a step ahead of the police," says psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack of a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the RC Monitoring company, which provides tracking services for both vehicles and persons, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can serve as aid.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If damage occurs, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person concerned."
"The most expensive devices are integrated with a tilting meter, so if the person just unwinds and remains mobile, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Čech.
In your opinion, a service of this type can even be obtained with intelligent mobile phones with navigation, where only a special software should be installed.
The problem of current tracking units is that for the time being it is devices with a size similar to a lockbox or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Macro Weil Pilin, for that reason tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a possible attacker may not identify the device."
"Or identifying it after a certain time, which can make the police take time," he adds.
Although the tracking devices are carried in the doll or hanging, they will continue using the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the verification of position with a GPS system (which is used in normal car navigation) combined with the function of a mobile phone communicating the current position.
The army has enough balls to round all of the Czech Republic, but it only takes two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of mecha to catch explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence added its arsenal 224 kilometers of mecha.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the mecha's useful life is two years, four to the sum.
The army bought the bullet for explosives to the STV Group, a.s. for forty million crowns.
The General's staff responded to MF DNEs by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mesh, saying soldiers need 60 kilometres of mesh per year for training manoeuvres.
According to the military pyrotechnics calculations, with which MF DNAs was contacted, it is decided, however, that, in this case, these manoeuvres should be carried out with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, senior officials, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They didn't want any exemption from the Minister of Defence Alexander Vondr and the captain of the Vlastimil Picek army.
Only in this way could it be justified that the army spends 60 kilometres of mecha.
This length is equal to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two metres of mesh, the army would have sufficient stocks with the new purchase (including the consumption of engineering units or special units) for the 225 mentioned above.
The rapid intervention brigade soldiers personally complained to Minister Vondra a short time ago because they said they only had ammunition for several weapons, so even shooting practices for money are limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of inner clothing.
"I also can't understand that they understand us repeatedly such amounts of mecha."
"But it's their decision and they will certainly know why they act like this."
"For us, the army is a good client to whom, as a company, we try to satisfy," admits the business director of STV Group, Jan Děcký.
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends hundreds of kilometres of mesh, also saying he will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký, of the STV Group, indicates that the mesh only has a useful life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to the possible criticisms of the army, does not want to give its name.
After the end of their useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument from the Ministry is that when buying 445 kilometers of mecha, he got a discount.
"We were costing 60% less than the last year's 244 kilometers request," says the spokesperson Pejšek from the Ministry of Defence shopping center.
Only to compare: the annual mass consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminates the ammo of World War II or left by the Soviet army, does not exceed 1,500 metres for years.
In addition, the police always ask only the right amount as to drain the ammunition before their useful life ends.
They decided it for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and, moreover, as much as possible to achieve more modern and reliable mechatypes.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in ending tens of thousands of tons of munitions of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovakian army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNEs spoke, after a few years the following problem will arise with the present: you will have to remove hundreds of kilometers of old mecha, which is now buying "barata".
So far, I continue to live on the contacts I have made thanks to the competition
The fact that winning the competition "Employer of the Year" helped Lukas Pytloun in the sale of the franchises of his hotel.
The last edition won the competition "Employer of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukas Pytloun of Liberec.
Your success story seems to be taken from a movie.
And Lucas Pytloun just loved traveling.
Foreigners realized that in Liberec there was a lack of quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he met with seasonal work abroad and a bank loan he bought a house that was half ruined with five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really brave.
"At present, the quality-price ratio of the accommodation in our area moved me to do something about it," says Lukas Pytloun.
He started renting the first refurbished floor for foreign workers.
All the incomes that he received reinvested in the building, which gradually turned into a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years' time in the business, he has managed to gradually open four guesthouses in Liberec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, opened up another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tísé, to which we sold our concept of franchise, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," said the businessman number one last year.
"This sale of hotel opening licenses greatly helped to win the 'Employer of the Year' competition," Pytloun added gratefully.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding areas.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
Without a doubt, he recommends to everyone that he would like to try out a company that participates in the competition.
But it does not think that it is necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live in contacts and known that, without the competition, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I've met thanks to the competition, I've started to collaborate regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included employees,
in total around seventy.
"I have seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition."
"It's not much less my own personal success, but it's the result of the hard work of the entire team."
"It's just my name that appears on the first level," says the modest Lukas Pytloun today.
To my successor I want a year quieter than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory soon became disbanded by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already passed the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žjárský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone competition "Company of the Year", last year in the "Slave House" in Prague.
The jury appreciated his efforts, with which he managed to convert a small technical workshop to Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the prize not only encouraged me, but all my colleagues and improved our confidence in fighting competition," said last year's winner.
Farmet's story begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel Žjárský's father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the embargo of properties during communism, he did not hesitate; he resigned from his position in the company in which he worked and, with a pair of partners, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetable oil press.
Eight years later they became the largest automatic press manufacturer in the centre of Europe.
They also had a greater presence among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the competition in the media.
"Not only did our customers start to view the Farm brand as much better, but foreign partners also began to value collaboration with a company that gained greater success in their country," says Karel Žjárský.
Last year maybe it wasn't just a sample of the euphoria of victory at Farmet.
It also received recognition for commercial results until 2008 and, in part, from 2009.
And just the year 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of machinery.
The deterioration of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and to start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We obviously don't get rid of this situation either."
"The income was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some discharges," explains Karel Žjárský.
A viable company should, at times, take even less popular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company's profits, although at lower levels than before the crisis.
Despite all this, where Farmet didn't cut expenses it was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, we strengthen the presence on the international market and have obtained magnificent ratings at national fairs," says Žjárský.
Everything indicates they've already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement hopes to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žjárský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous rules
The Absurdez survey of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already succeeded in eliminating some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the year's Absurdez survey was the obligation to bring documents to the administration to which officials can access online.
The decision took more than one-third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of social security asked for an extract from the commercial register, although its officials could obtain it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer ask for an extract from the trade register when it carries out a check on the insurance's taxes," ČSSZ spokesman Jana Buranová said.
The objective of the Absurdez survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations that must be respected by companies and entrepreneurs in Chequia and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year forms for a fourth part of the corporate tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and begins to create affection also among the general public.
While last year's edition included the participation of three thousand voters, this year almost reached four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have a number of remaining legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in number of papers needed for the tax declaration we are in the world first," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business standards has been a declared goal of all governments.
However, compared with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, Chequia is located in position 74a, i.e. eight worse positions than last year.
The Absurdez contest of the year was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone may indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmoroku.cz. The organizer of the competition then selects seven candidates for the "anti-premium" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
You win the absurdity you get more votes.
For this year's survey, more than a hundred were submitted, in particular 105 rules and regulations that did not make sense.
Examples were sent by both employers and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, was the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and motorways pay their wages or that businessmen with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of seventy proposals for this year is published on the competition pages.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held in early November at Wenceslao Square in Prague, is part of an event in which political and social world personalities are often involved.
This year, for example, they attended this event of Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State constantly bothers entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently make trade unnecessary," said Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in the water of trash.
In 2007, what bothered people most was the obligation of the entrepreneur to communicate with a three-day advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention of going to a trade fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation, which was completed in the second place in number of votes in 2007, that is to say, the communication to the working office by its foreign workers from work trips up to 30 days, was eliminated in the so-called green card law.
And the third one wins.
The 2009 Absurdez was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a fridge and two floor bascules.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication stating that it had removed the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are being evaluated.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny competition is the category called the company responsible for 2010.
The outcome of this competition is to support the responsible and fair companies.
"This is how we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their environmental activity and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of Vodafone's mobile operator, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebelde of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of Vodafone Company's 2010 main competition, companies for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activity varies completely from one to the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, this is the case of persons with disabilities, in others of the personal or health problems of employees.
Among the 14 finalists in the whole of the Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company in charge of the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of funds for sponsoring disabled children for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a paper that is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, as they represent more than 70% of the model, which is why it received the title of the company responsible for the central area of Chequia and in the Vodafone Company competition of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc he won the MiRyz Soft accounting company, which reduced the working time, even below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also granted because it primarily purchases Czech producers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities will have the least impact on the environment," explains entrepreneur Milosche Ryznarová.
The responsible IT Enlogit company in the region of Ústí also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; it also supports the work from home and in its business events uses catering services from a protected local company.
"In addition, we support the Persona scholarship, which specifically assists the local Roma community," said the representative of Ondřej Suchý.
There is also a good mention of the Praní and Čištění laundry company in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive benefits in a special way that affects their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transport, improvement of qualifications and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, of Bruntál Czasch construction company, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company competition of the year were automatically appointed who answered the registration form's questions and sent it to the organizers before 15 August.
Organizers removed from the evaluation forms that were not complete or incorrect.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the company responsible for the year, but are not disqualified from the "principal" Vodafone Company of the year."
"The individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the main competition of the year", says Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose Advisory.
Police arrested during a public auction in the building of the Agricultural Fund, in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police have carried out several arrests in the agricultural fund building in the last few days.
The detectives married a local media entrepreneur and the real estate entrepreneur Lubosh G.
It seems that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the refund of rights in such a way that the underground would receive a precise interest.
I should have paid Lubosh G. half a million crowns for that.
"For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person on bribes during a public auction and public auction," Pávo said the chief of the general prosecutor of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that he cannot now disclose any more details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police released the businessman for 46 years.
On how it could influence the public auction, given the lack of official information, one can only speculate.
The spokesman for the Lubomíra Černá Agricultural Fund answered Pávo's questions by saying that the police actually took the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and was during a public auction.
"It's a client, not one of our employees," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Convocation for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the Land Act" and takes place when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the call, offer a value higher than their refund, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"On the basis of the tenders, the order of buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest offer" the Fund spokesperson explained.
Lubosh G. had information on who was going to be present at the call and, at the same time, he was interested because he had acquired various refund rights, proposed to those interested in the field that would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on it.
Lubosh G. had special contacts at Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was the cause of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of defaming the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubosh G. has just obtained from the Fund some planned sites for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular where a large road to the industrial area of Borská pole should be built.
Later, he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city with a very higher value.
In this case, the town had to intervene because, otherwise, blocked land would avoid construction.
Families should pay extra expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Homes will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rentals.
As a result, families will have to get out of the wallet, starting in January, several hundred crowns a month more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, the gas is about 2%, in some cities up to 10% more due to water supply, and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should rise to about 100 crowns more a year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers have reduced prices, as support for renewable energy production has increased, in particular photovoltaic.
However, gas is moderately concentrated, especially at the time when heating is used more and therefore greater is consumption.
In this case, they should also have a couple of hundred crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are fuelled throughout the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The rise in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 crowns a month from January due to central heating, while the Liberec families will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns a year.
Residents in Prague should also bear an increase of 9 per cent of the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rental does not vary, the pests will pay an additional 6.8 per cent.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will be 7.4%.
The rental prices of 450,000 apartments rented in Prague can be significantly increased, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which has about 2,500 floors in Ústí nad Labem, will increase the rental from January to 100%.
The company will bring to the courts those who do not agree with the new rental.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of about 300,000 floors, could increase the year to 10%.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and ron. The beer is no longer in fashion, because it makes a slow effect
Fernet, ron, vodka and even good whiskey stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause you to end up in medical care for young drinkers under 15 years of age.
The children who end up being beaten in the hospital constantly to overcome the breakup are no longer an exception.
This is due to the experience of doctors who have these cases in hospital admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because they take a long time to get drunk."
"Now fashion is the strong alcoholic drinks," Pávo tells the chief of pediatrician hospital Horôovice in the center of Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they can get a bottle to their father of the alacena, it can be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of getting along with juice and not smelling so much," she explains.
It is also confirmed by the spokesperson for the University Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or ron."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, especially among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use the waiter that they took home," Jurinová added.
According to Chief Pelikán, they are 13 and 14-year-old drinkers who usually appear in hospitals.
Before Horôovice, where he has been working since this year, worked for a decade in the pediatrician in Motol, where the ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter maybe four times."
"He started twelve years when he was brought with 3.5 alcohol in the blood, plus a mixture of ecstasy," the department's doctor said.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother didn't surprise him that his daughter disappeared 48 hours," the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance to drinking by their children, which is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak independently of dependence.
"It is understood by alcohol to a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, rather it is due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelikán.
According to the spokesman Jurinová, this year, 40 Hebrew children were hospitalized in the pediatric clinic of Motol until mid-November.
However, statistics only show those who go with serious poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after the medical profession, go home with their parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply meet after school and drink in anticipation, there are three seasonal high places for Pelikan to mention: the day of the witch, the end of the year and the end of the school course.
"In such a situation, they drink by bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of holidays."
"In the day of witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven Hebrews at once," Pelikán added.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they don't suffer a terrible holiday at home.
The morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injection of a serum with glucose and the nutrients missing from the body.
"They take it much better, because after the busy night, they get up well and don't hurt them at all."
"They are only confused about where they are," says Pelikán, adding that, often, patients lose the good mood at least when they see the costs they have generated.
The ambulance and hospitalization in a room for patients with severe illness cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children how much it has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer on a job for young people to earn enough to pay that night," Pelikán adds.
Medical insurance, in its opinion, may be a regressive measure, which usually returns the costs of treatment to people, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 planes are first located in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft from a total of five, by which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the aircraft Casa C-295M, departed on Tuesday to Seville, where the manufacturer of the aircraft Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time a device of this kind is in the hands of someone who is not the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad to conduct practical or demonstration flights.
It is the version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three planes are L-159.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the broker of the sale, Omnipol, was already charged with them last week.
Jan Pejesk, from the defense press department, says that it is not yet known when Vodochody's planes will be physically withdrawn.
"The L-159, on the other hand, were separated from the aircraft repaired long ago, without investments or additional contributions by the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 biplazas were exchanged in their current state," Pávo Pejšek said.
He added that the army did not remain without two-planes, as in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Air Vodochody for an amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four L-159 non-necessary devices for twins.
One of the new planes has already received the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS committed itself to adding aircraft to the equipment of some associated countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the one that removes L-159 aircraft and will serve for the practice of NATO pilots."
"Therefore, it depends on the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework," says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by an aircraft Casa and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3,500 million crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not invite an invitation to tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defence management claims that the exchange promotes future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, which is why it wants to sell the rest.
Buying airplanes Casa is likely to have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already appealed to the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by making a European bid and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at Kbely's Prague airport in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the ant indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the anal are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
It could depend on the testosterone level, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, in particular if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, as Eeles says.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed with a British counterpart of over 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger of the right hand shorter than it cancels.
They presented the same likelihood of prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than their thumb, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under 60%, the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined during the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knew the study, but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer can be "demonstrated completely".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Chequia, like most of Europe, dawned the snowy Thursday.
The roads and axles are mainly covered by compact snow and the take-off machines circled all night for many areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between the 89 and 93 kilometres towards Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourism, as well as the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Central Automotive Club (UAMK).
At mile 91 a truck was dropped, in 93 two industrial vehicles were hit that caused injuries.
Several tourists also ended up in the county.
There are also problems in the D1 motorway in the 185 km towards Prague.
That's where they hit two trucks.
Drivers must circle slowly after Brno in the 190 km or cross Brno and be incorporated in the 182 km in Kývalce.
There have been traps several kilometers.
An accident has also occurred on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a snow layer of several centimeters and thermometers indicate -7 oC.
They are forming traps, for example in Prosek, although it is also congested Štěrboholská.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Tranvies run late, for example in the line between Karlo namestí and Námestí Miru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and the airport.
Due to the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three speeds.
Problems, for example, affect the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně airport closed from 11 in the morning until 5 in the morning.
Currently, most roads in southern Moravia can already be circulated, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska there are closed to traffic three secondary roads, in Brnońska snow languages are being formed, and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
To date, connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Milosovice.
To clear them, frescoes will be required.
At the moment it cannot be said when they will be open to circulation.
In Hodoninska, caution is required in the area of Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathies).
The roads of the region that, since it is a protected natural area, should simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to ČTK.
In Chequia they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowflakes are gradually sent to Chequia.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American army is using a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, which is now known only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that "change the progress of the game" would win.
The new weapons are like a small gun with an extremely precise puncture.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives that contains causes it to actually function as a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind a barrier, a wall or a trench.
Without a doubt, normal protection cannot be used and when it launches its deadly rain of metallic atlases, it can be essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses a "intelligent" technology.
"Soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to the same laser beam, which determines the distance, then gets a precise point of view and, according to it, corrects the projection line and taps the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pushed, the gun is loaded and the projectile is launched at a distance of 543 meters, less than one, two or three meters," Audette points out.
400 jobs are transferred
The Fujitsu consortium moved its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their place of work of their former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moved its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As reported by the giant computerized sector and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg al Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße Street in Niederrad district, Frankfurt.
A spokesman from Fujitsu explained that, in the medium term, more than 100 employees from the consortium, previously spread across the region, would be accommodated there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franzkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure".
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important at present for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new change of an important company in the region brought joy yesterday among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against it.
Frankfurt's Head of Economics Section, Markus Frank (CDU) said that a Global Player has been won.
This is a "magnificent recognition of the location".
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a great boost for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management first informed the city of its intention.
"Of course we have offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
In the end, economic reasons led to the fall.
Thus, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous place.
"I hope that the owner and tenant of the building are cooperative."
The furniture used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Verticale" were part of the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial construction project in the town.
As a joint project of the city and of a private project company between the station and the town, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive construction that previously used the hatches as parking spaces and the level of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment council and charging companies, the software manufacturer for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then merged Siemens with the Fujitsu computer manufacturer house.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later sold back to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, originating in Tokyo, is recognised as the third world's largest IT supplier.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides accurate services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, in all respects Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions branch is located from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the 20's, its name refers to its star-shaped plan, among other things to the central electrical association and to the electronic industry.
Amazon Cancels Server - Threats Against Assange
Anxiety is getting more and more of Wikileaks.
Amazon Internet service provider has removed the disclosure platform from your server.
It is possible to find political pressure behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is apparently detained in England.
Wikileaks' revelation platform is always the whitest of criticisms, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an Internet country in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to the Wikileaks boycott.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is on the list of people sought for Interpol, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from the Amazon server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," revealed the activists of the revelations through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had used the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon service website to address high numbers of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Perfectly, we will target our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after a Senator Joe Lieberman employee had requested investigations, informed the CNN chain according to a call to the Lieberman office.
The Senate Security Council presidency had threatened Amazon with boycott, British "Guardian" reported.
"I had wished that Amazon would take these measures before, before previous information publications classified through Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and reckless process of Wikileaks puts our national security at risk and threatens life in the world," said an independent senator's statement.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with their service to expand stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is sought in Sweden for suspected rape, is on the list of people sought for Interpol.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
Internet activist has constantly qualified research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats have existed.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undiscloded.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to North America's statements.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the responsible for the revelations of Wikileaks should be judged by betrayal and executed.
In Canada, he said a chief of government chief Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange there is a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for American President Barack Obama, described as "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange has requested the resignation of the State Secretary, in case she is responsible for ordering recently diplomats involved in spying tasks.
"I'm not absolutely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than your website."
The US government needs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in general.
Russell Travers, Deputy Distribution Director of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed an exceptional officer, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks' filtration.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that in order to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, the publication of Wikileaks should be put at risk.
"We've done our best to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The university of ice cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice creamers are prepared in the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the highest flow and visitors around the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
Ice cream and ice cream.
The ice cream is prepared in accordance with all the rules of Italian art for the preparation of ice cream.
The ice cream with a spatula extracts the ice cream from the display, expands it over the boat and sells it.
To learn about this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of his machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the highest flow and visitors around the world.
There are also more special courses for more days on chocolate ice cream and practice in the refrigerator of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream with a new professional career, others risk in the mild freezing of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of this art in California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a European product of quality in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something self-sufficient in a few years' time in an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a refrigerator in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice creams from their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice creams.
The ice master Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants later the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only its good taste but also its thirsting mildness and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the birth cover of the national top house, mainly from the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is just the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to development seems easy.
Luciano takes the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large bathrobe, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the machine grip and exit a pasteurized white basic cream, the base for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be prepared only with natural elements or without stabilizer?
How can it be given to some desires to experiment?
Luciano advises that the trends of the time are revealed.
The one that speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", has best used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably gum guar, of guar frijol.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a ice creamed granite sound.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
They use aromas.
With regard to the taste of ice cream, Master Luciano distinguishes the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the sweetness of the supermarket.
Besides, there are powders and pastas.
"All suppliers will try to add aromatized ingredients to their goods."
"However, they must experiment once."
Whether with sorbates of fruit with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the ice cream of the white basic mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with powder cocoa as the basis for all possible chocolate delights.
The participants in the course can now use the refrigerators.
Luciano lets them develop four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, moca and avellan, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
They also carry out the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
Better knowledge does not necessarily depend on having more aroma of toffee or more pure fruit.
It is not necessary that the ice cream of avelanas be dried, if it contains more avelanas.
The working group develops the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
First a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice cream, says Luciano.
The preparation of ice cream is an architectural problem: The pure melocotone with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar ratio of the basic recipe must be lowered.
For lemon ice, an extra sugar portion is needed.
Luciano takes out a tool that sets the amount of sugar of the types of fruit (measure of the vineyard for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the account.
The preparation of ice cream requires no more than physical application, as before.
Not only helps the tool for the automatic development of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, in which the mixture of ice prepared is beat simultaneously and cooled at a temperature below zero.
Nevertheless, all automation is left out for the small paste.
Brazilian Gustavo leaves himself and his companions from above down with pure fruit, as if it were a giant tiny without control.
"At all courses," says Professor Luciano, "it's just a matter of time that something like this happens."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has been infiltrated into the transgenic plant industry.
This issue is currently formulated by the Expert Group Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems a conspiracy theory but we have not documented it well," said Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, and another Efsa expert have also been hired for years at the Ilsi Association.
Consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost him.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in the Efsa testing standards of genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, criticizing Then.
The provisions of EFSA are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the company's writing, which is in fact controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech criticises a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa was without support or the time of transition to the Swiss Agriarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed his band with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, which were carried out by the Environment Office as well as a clear parliamentary EU.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, are used, provided they are of high and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working in Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper accepts his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is called itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among other things for assessing the risk to biotechnology without Lobby's burden.
In this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticise that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants in the environment is not verified.
"We want to know what, for example, makes the corn genetically modified in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice consists of checking only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If the risks are not sought, how will they be found?", question, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientific research has been investigating the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Institute of Technology.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in the US and Europe.
So there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a general rule.
"Industry controls security investigation," maintains Hilbeck.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell has got some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday I was in front of Stuttgart station, with the tube on the back.
There were manifestations
It's a mess.
The story is known: In September the diggers arrived and began to pour down a large portion of the north wing.
Stuttgart's land has never been the same again: thousands and thousands have manifested themselves against the s21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As it was pointed out, most of the wing was turned into rubble.
Route in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Craigsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough mixed stone raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"This stone is a remnant."
"They mustn't disappear."
It is enthusiastic: "A cheap and poor, simple and natural stone."
As he once said, he smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what to do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trace of Stuttgart's stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in an earlier munitions warehouse of the French Army, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He's bought everything that comes from the destruction in Stuttgart.
"They'd have dishonored it, they'd torture it, or they'd have sent it to the trash," he says in his office, a wooden box that once was a guard box.
They insulted him and threatened him, explained, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, who had bought the remains of the north wing to the sales company.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything about the fall.
And when it happened, it was the most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilometer knife, with a price per piece of EUR 6.50 to 14.
Some took it as a reminder but also with the hope of being able to return it to a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest of the time it was sold.
Owner of gardens, landscaper, project manager.
They arrived everywhere and took what they could carry in the suitcase and above.
Stuttgart's impulse stone has long been turned into "the wall" or the boundary of Kräuterbeeten.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
He ascends to his entire land, he makes a tour of his great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a stone lover.
He's staying at 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures all over Germany.
He says he's the country's biggest stone dealer.
Frena.
In the snow there are articulated sandstones.
"They belonged to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," she explains.
It's white, yellow, warm, if you're excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Mark a lot: Red sand, an earlier section of the Karlsruhe station.
And keep going.
"Bonito travertino."
In ancient times the maizes belonged to the Neckarstadion tribunal in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, the yellow travertine of the Stuttgart police chief, the red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, the tomb of the hospital in Heilbronner.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple apparatus and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a shame if something was destroyed."
It has not become very rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people have said to make the stone dealer, as well as singers, a sculptor, a heir, a glassman and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is satisfying," says the man who is responsible for taking advantage of the remains.
In a little while, you have to go to Colonia.
There are also stones to rescue.
Fighting talent around great potentials
I have an active flow in the buffet.
16 students hide around the pancakes, tomato soup and sweets.
Braunschweig Technical University and Vokswagen car manufacturer have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of competition of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
By rivalling and in the same way, many companies, like VW, meet in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
Your mission: To hire students as soon as possible with the most talented of universities, before entering the labour market and being hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications on the skills of their students, they try to reach exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins the talents.
A lady in the staff department shares bollígraphs, rubbers and folders with the VW logo.
Explain to the illusioned young talents the programs of practice and work for students and show them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig takes the project with VW.
See advantages for both sides: "Students come in contact with industry and acquire experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, observe more closely the interested candidates and consider them as possible future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so desired directly.
"The main point was previously in technical projects," Selle said.
The fight for fresh graduates is becoming harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees among a large group of applicants.
Unless they have to announce and, above all, to get a highly qualified working hand.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI for its German stamps), in October there were 40,000 vacant engineers.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this engineering vacuum will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for the hunting of talents.
Organize expensive recruitment events, such as KPMG's career, a type of modern Yankee, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the United States next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of election on the exit.
Only the cream of many participants goes to the United States.
Universities are increasingly trying to choose and purify the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to highlight the mass."
"The simple journey by itself would have been short."
For hunters Dykta notes give results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some are close to their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to direct approach to the campus, they are also hunting, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their work fairs.
"We're trying to get students at specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sita Stübe, staff manager for the Solarworld technology manufacturer.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently there are 35 vacancies on the company's website.
"It's very complicated to fill the vacancies."
"It takes a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld works with several higher schools, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that you can practice with us or perform your thesis.
No advertising campaigns are carried out for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote with other advantages: personal environment, woolen hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium can't usually offer it," says Stübe, staff manager.
Looking for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, child assistance or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld offers 55th place among the top 100 employees in Germany.
The Institute shall draw up an annual list of the best German employment providers.
As to what the employee asks, I am satisfied that he is with work and the environment in it and that he observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff member also expects extra points in his or her classification for his or her graduates to work.
"I believe that the applicant is especially fixed in the external classifications of an employer potential," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want a long-term strategy that earns a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as an employer goes by the employees themselves," he assures.
In the sector's jegga is called Internal Employer Branding, also promotion of corporate identity within its own template.
"A satisfied employee is the best ambassadors."
When people are treated well and identified with the company, then direct promotion is achieved for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," Kriegler says.
Obama holds new oil drillings
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government has issued a strong ban and has thereby annulled its previous plans irrevocably.
New drillings currently under way remain before the Atlantic coast.
This announced the interior minister, Ken Salazar, Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will at least be in force over the next five years, is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the tragedy that cost 11 workers their lives and caused the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new drillings in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under the pressure of opposition and industry.
In this way, the participants wanted to reduce the dependence of the US on new foreign oil supplies.
To date, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
In the centre of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced with millions of demands.
A research commission commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the minister of the interior, raised the perforation moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various petroleum consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to discard a new catastrophe by using more stringent controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible control authority, which has been charged with corruption charges, is reformed as a root.
Obama also announces that the profit tax gaps for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that the total take-off in the Gulf will be less thanks to stricter regulation, so far.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current research carried out by the BDO consulting company - before the ban on Wednesday's extraction.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are being extended as soon as possible, to the detriment of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil marron, smells like a gas tank: Millions of gallons of raw waste have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from stealing, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari looks good.
"Don't get tired," calms the environmental activist to the journalists: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys walking in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colourful brightness of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is not seen that brown oil stains float over the surface.
He used to take his legs to his fists, explains Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetti River.
In the meantime, the liquid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago it turned into the huge wet, impressive amount of oil by a rotary tube.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to get to fish-filled waters: that, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most austere regions in the world.
On the way to the river that passes through manglars, the widespread desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship's engine removes a brown heat, which sinks its hand into the water, will take out a bunch of oil.
The roots of the mandarins' trees rise from the ground like dark palm trees of regaliz, sadly isolate the palm trees that shake and crush their palm trees.
In vano you are looking for bird gangs, as if you were in the wet as always: As the outside barrier is quiet, a sort of fantastic calm of an earlier paradise with oily smell is spread in it.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle," says, Hurricane Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
Here's the verbal comparison.
The ogoni settlement area has been a busy battlefield for years: here the first European explorers have broken up over 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to place his first factory Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today, the return of companies to Ogoniland is prohibited: while daily they were pumping more than two million black gold barrels from the whole region of the delta, of a size three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters highlighted steel platforms such as water sculptures: "Navid Arbolites" kindly called the head of the perforators.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them have a total corrosion.
Every moment a head fails, Akpobari says, then he handles a constant chorus of oil in the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres have been spent in 50 years in the delta ecosystem: Year after year, the amount of oil penetration, as in the absence of the boat "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in Alaska, one of the largest ecological disasters in the history of mankind.
Whoever is responsible for the long-term environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists come to the heads to break up and to the pipelines with leaks such as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low standards of safety normally the conventionals in the world, scientist Richard Steiner appealed to the consortium in 2008: Only the tube defects indexes are "over multiples more than elsewhere".
In a place, which from far seems forgotten, there appears a oil-filled workshop under the free sky, figures emerge from among the manglers: They are bare and oil-covered.
Among the many barrels, which are sometimes connected to perforations, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, fires a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated in the fire for hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, the petrol penetrates through the pipelines in the container, later the oil pipeline drops and finally comes out of diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300 litre diesel barrels daily: "It brings us 34,000 naira", about $22.
Delta residents take advantage of the shortage of fuel in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of only 40 euros per litre, illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", which called the network of pipelines across Ogoniland: According to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil per day are lost throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the temporary raw material stored is clearly illegally reclaimed: organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and senior military personnel, keep the best part in aljibes and sell it cheap in the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate purely academically on whether the environmental disaster is due to the management of the population or the production fleet.
"If the oilers did not act as invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the Ogoni are mainly destroyed by Shell to the point that only a deduction of the consortium appears: "Maybe it is better to present another nationality, such as China."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's time for you to disappear," says muscle Ölmann.
"Soldiers can come any minute."
If the special unit of the army takes illegal refiners, do not threaten to arrest them, unless with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to benefit from the raw material.
"This invention has completely made pieces to our country," Akpobari says.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that carried out a forced landing, researchers found a possible factory defect, which could produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
The Qantas airline wants to ask the engine manufacturer.
Airbus passengers in Qantas who made an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than the one you can imagine: Australian air safety authorities, thanks to their investigations, perceived a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and alerted to a possible factory defect.
The potential of the defect has complicated implications: In a connection of mangoes, cracks can be caused by fatigue or cracks, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 aircraft.
Among those found was the Qantas-Airbus which had to land on 4 November in Singapore.
Australian airline launches legal media against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a request in the federal court of Sidney that provided for more legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline would claim compensation for the November incident.
In the engine brand they have lost pieces and their wing is deteriorating.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gas as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from all over the world have to be repaired.
Australian researchers announced that they would carry out more safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with affected engines.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, ATSB spokesman.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas apparatus, the aircraft kept its A380 fleet on the ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained approximately three of its 11 A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa retired the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-covered plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A Nevada all over the country causes traffic chaos
Totally white Germany: From one day to another has snowed in almost the whole country.
On many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter ice Germany: In almost all of the country there were iced temperatures during the night of Thursday, which has triggered traffic chaos in many places.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer of 15 cm thick.
Traffic is very limited in most highways and in many streets.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the kitanieves are in continuous operation, removing the new snow once and again, but not ready.
In addition, strong windmills block the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects live tides with water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on highways and national roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsische Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of snow recently dropped and cold and strong winds are responsible for remodeling it.
Many trucks and cars were caught there during the night.
Also in Sajonia Anhalt, police authorities reported major street riots.
At A2, the snow and the wind paralyze traffic and create traps.
In Turkey, snowflakes affected A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disorders are expected in Sajonia, Sajonia Anhalt, Turingia and northern Bavaria.
The snow on the road, the fallen trees on the carts or the destroyed chain and the holes are the main problems.
The interurban service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended in Saxony.
In Saafeld, Turkey an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Bombers and rescue service served 165 passengers on the train with wool, food and drink covers.
The snowy winds block the streets.
At the largest German airport, the snow winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokesperson from the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman for Fraport, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
The kitanieves are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers at the airport, although there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
On many streets, on Wednesday afternoon, there were many accidents already.
In the afternoon a truckman fell into a collision with a train on a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The engineer suffered slight injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident because of the snowy streets: here too a truck was reached on a road crossing because the vehicle was caught.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, Bayreuth's trip to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after driving a car near Ashchenburg on a resbalade road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be more and more soft and dusty and will therefore be cooled up in soft roots.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
No doubt it will continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 negative degrees.
Godche Bank seeks a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for buyers for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could provide up to EUR 500 million.
Recently, Deutsche Bank arranged its headquarters: The twin towers were modernized in the neighborhood of Frankfurt banks; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to take advantage of the costs of reunification, and look for a buyer for the two scrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland states, based on a spokesman.
The spokesman shall not appoint the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always check whether the property should be owned or sold and then rented again," he said.
That is why the largest credit institution in Germany returns to its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 by EUR 272 million from the investor of a home fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms have reached some EUR 200 million.
A sale would make a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this area calculate the value of the towers of the newspaper renamed "Greenowers" at around EUR 500 million.
If the renewed buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor it has not been currently revealed, the spokesman said.
Thousands of mourning people for the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of buried mines, which were killed after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies could not be found, however, because the security measures remained precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion in the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between 17 and 62 years of age were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced at the site of the disaster, but no sign of survival was found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue equipment could be lowered for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts indicated that there was no possibility that the miners would have survived.
They have not been able to recover the bodies to date.
Families and friends now remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the bright sunlight in Greymouth in the New Zealand island of the South.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of miners.
There were also photographs and personal objects, under clothes and surf tables.
The flags ran out on average even in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that miners would return to the surface "of the depths of the earth," said John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, to the participants in the commemorative act.
"But they never returned home."
He cannot take the death of his son until he has seen his body, Lawrie Drew said, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative act.
In the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African mines were also buried.
The rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the island of the South of New Zealand.
As explosive gases have been extracted, the abrasive temperatures within the mine will begin to decline, said Gary Knowles, the chief police officer, to journalists.
Damn it, warrior!
Does the gore fit in the art film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the gender with his epoch of the battles "Wallala Rising".
What audience would the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought about when he was filming Wallalla Rising?
A Viking warrior arrested with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators who seek bloodthirsty action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and kill his enemies the triples of his bodies with life when he is of bad humour.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost no word throughout the film and the other characters are taken for as much one or two sentences or a couple of painful mortal screams.
On the contrary, they are quiet and enjoy the beautiful and fearsome landscapes of Scotland, which the builders offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Better ideal for grown and interested filmmakers in existentialism and in very calm camera movements.
When a movie has several groups of recipients it is a pity that they cannot discard each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his wildlings and trilogy on the peacock drug dealer "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but it is stochasticly refusing to make his works for all audiences with something more humour in the main stream or something less brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and threeps that explode cannot deter most of the followers of the artistic film.
Most of the fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a bunch of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and is stuck an eternity in calm and cloud before his team comes to America and comes back to quiet there.
It's a shame that Wallalla Rising hasn't found a cinematographic distributor in Germany and only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the alleged and bloodthirsty façade, there is sometimes an exciting piece of film that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, everything is an atmosphere, a febrile dream transformed into a film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is awarded only a moment of relaxation and its glacier images and the narrow sound band of trance make him a nude in his throat, especially the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes to him.
Only a young ruby, who loyally supports Unojo, maintains something as innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of one eye, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents the loss, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
Wallalla Rising is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, change and surprise.
An experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country rejects its opinion on this issue until controls are allowed.
On the average night of 5-6 September 2007, at least four Israeli combat planes F-15 I attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the edge of the Euphrates; the nearest and largest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that emerges from the river.
According to information from the CIA International Intelligence Service of April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the very appropriate proximity of El-Kibar for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
Instead, the technique serves only for purposes other than for those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also taught photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the interior.
It was not long ago that the reactor was operating, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years after the bombing, it's only known more than then, the puzzles got bigger over time.
The former president of the United States, George W. Bush, recently revealed in his memories that prior to the CIA attack, he was absolutely sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but that he saw only indications that there was "a nuclear weapon program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about a "responsible", although they consider the CIA's presentation 'plausible'.
They lack solid evidence, as well as IAEA.
When he was asked how certain he was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior U.N. diplomat answered in the summer in a stone-cold way that the IAEA had "sufficient material to have questions".
The Syrians quickly withdrew from the alleged "unutilized military building" and spread the land to consciousness.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium traces in El Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, IAEA received satellite images about a member state, commercial sellers at the moment immediately after the attack, which must have a higher information value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always understood that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as inverse after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss this, as well as satellite images.
In addition, drivers are prohibited from a second inspection in the Kibar and entry into the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also maintains strict silence.
"Never will we comment," Ehud Olmert, prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not produced results since June 2008 and "has gradually turned into a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, a serious breach of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons, thereby being observed by the IAEA.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others as these still exist.
Inspectors have not made themselves public until the time when the teams are being treated, or what their functions are, or if they seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as interiors from the vicinity of the cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is very likely to be one of the suspicious objects.
It is likely to be at or immediately at the side of a military base, Syria for this reason prohibits the entry into the three locations of the IAEA.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear a record that the United States has requested the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment due to the US secret service's warnings.
Through satellite photographs, IAEA has indications that material is transferred between the three places and the cube to the Euphrates coast.
A Western diplomat with a high rank in Vienna said that at least one of the teams can be "related to fuel production".
But there is no "no indication of sensitive activities", either of uranium enrichment or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor acts with uranium that is not enriched.
Where the uranium should come from and where the plutonium should subsequently be separated for the bombs, for these central questions there are, in the best case, plausible assumptions.
There is no doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can be recovered, are in the three places.
As hundreds of trucks from the ground disappeared, no one has information on where the debris remains.
The OIAE considers it unlikely that the salt mine al-Tibni, located in the few kilometres from El-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, was recognized by the Syrians in 1998 by their capacity as a radioactive waste area.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, related it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But the photographs from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three suspected locations and removed large containers after IAEA requested entry.
It can be a coincidence but it only helps to dissipate suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that the IAEA has used a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which the Syrians would allow, in order to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of inspectors' interest.
However, Damascus also criticises this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna calmed down a year ago that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador, has been taking out so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Vienna nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option that I am open to in the future", but is still empty.
This route is very risky: most of the IAEA governance board is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for a climb.
On the other hand, how did one diplomat reflect: "And what if at the end they find nothing?"
Love in the Times of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the direction of her debut still nameless.
She herself wrote the script, a story of love between a Bosnian and a Serb.
You don't know much more about it, but this is enough for the agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman is in love with her Serb rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnia and Herzegovina's women's associations have protested quickly, with which they last moved a few days of planned rounding in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's war victims organization wrote to the UN High Commissioner for UNHCR by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
It is not diplomatic, the women offered him a meeting in Hungary several weeks ago that he refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories in the fields of rape, and Jolie's position in this regard is suffocating to the victims enough on the script.
Its organization, in accordance with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended that Jolie become an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, gave it a shot and seized a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not quite clear why Jolie was not at all.
The young author reiterates that he does not pursue political purposes with his film, is introduced with great effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
Its contents are still unclear.
On the network, a second syspsy of the film that sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the beginning of the war and came back to meet when she, a Muslim Bosnian, was deported to a Serbian field where he worked as a guard.
What sounds significantly different is the variant "victim of rape is in love with torture".
It's certain that Jolie's film really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "injustice and based on incorrect information".
Currently they can achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script continues on the network illegally, like many others before.
Nothing as far away from here
This afternoon is finally going to be good for the Irish.
No sign of distress
On the other hand, the home team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout with joy as they resound the loud music, hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey Club vibrates in the Southern Cork, because players launch, and find, pingpong balls to beer bottles from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few tickets to Las Vegas for the world berpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this strafalous drinking game and the computer's discretion really don't make good jokes.
And 26-year-old boy is trying to have fun with that, to get distracted by the question of what the future will look like.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in its plans, in January you will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad presence," he says.
"He's too far from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from a shot he got the work of his dreams as event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smile.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, his brother Colin currently works as a IT consultant in London.
Young people go: In the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, predict economic experts and the ESRI Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015 there are 200,000 immigrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The prognostics confirm that there is a similar migration wave to which the island suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress that brought great prosperity to Irish people, melancholy is now expanding.
The economic crisis confuses, above all, young, well-trained Irish people, for whom so far, everything is expensive.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of boom.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of every ten men and women under the age of 30 are on the stand.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young immigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything is sinking."
"There should be an upsurge against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, goes and loses our country and with that to an entire generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish students' union, sees a dark future to come because the government is only dedicated to mountings and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but have no strategies to achieve new jobs," says 20-year-old girl.
Note how their colleagues are from unreminded practices to the following.
His greatest concern, he explains, is to have to migrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnnon are trying to see this topic in a positive way.
McLarnnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
"For those who start to work, doing so abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career," said the manager.
There are photos of a boy practicing surfing in Australia and others practicing snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, unless it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O'Donovan knows how to build something elsewhere.
Since there was nothing more to be done for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 Irish partners in the construction in Germany.
Now they're raising a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
He's going to Hanover or Berlin in January, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works extra hours to be able to pay a loan to his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says, as long ago the first time he walked the threshold of his house.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs a little ashamed and goes for cold rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with garden care in front of the houses, in the entrance there are large and expensive cars parked.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent financed by a loan.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid to fail with the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves hotter tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
Civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he often listens to right now.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in times past here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst that can happen, perhaps with it we feel like Irish for the first time."
He laughs and says about his father, who went to England in the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He's been working in London for a couple of years, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend go well in New Zealand?
But in these days there is one thing that worries you: the celebration of your 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
I'm afraid I can degenerate at a farewell party.
"Only, not too much emotion," he says, and gives a big shot to his beer.
"Excuse me, it sounds very distressing."
"We better call her a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as support for private companies.
Crime causes greater concern than unemployment.
In addition, in most of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows for monitoring changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year's survey, held in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively mood in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the coast of the Pacific of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
He also grew up in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a great decline in production last year.
However, only half of Mexico and Brazil surveyed, the two most populated countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Graph 2).
Around 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy operates in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but significantly higher than 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (Graph 3).
Around 34 per cent said they trusted the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but significantly higher in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it was maintained during the global financial crisis was probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty was only marginally increased in 2009 and that it had been reduced again this year to 32 per cent.)
However, the state of mind varies considerably from country to country (see Graph 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where recession was more severe and has increased violent crimes.
For the second time since the beginning of the surveys, the most surveyed in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Graph 5).
About 31 per cent claim that either they or a close relative has been a victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has been reduced since 38 per cent of last year and is the lowest recorded percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic performance is reflected in greater support for private enterprises and the market economy: approximately 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private enterprises are essential for development, while in 2007 only 56 per cent (see Figure 6).
Around 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow its country to develop, compared with 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of Venezuelan respondents feel the same (and 80% support private companies), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the country that exercises greater leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela bears such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went through a much worse way than those foreigners who were afraid of trying to help the country to recover from their problems.
Votes were put in the polls, some people voted several times, papers taken in the polls, destroyed electoral colleges and acts of intimidation.
The election colleges opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, were defeated.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, reported fraud and requested the annulment of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior United Nations official in Haiti, stated that "some relatively good elections were in many ways."
The observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said with caution that "we do not believe that these irregularities, which are serious, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which, according to its opponents, is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and its candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The discharge is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes for elections have yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial request in which they requested the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr. Célestin, who only has support, if he has any, has moved to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic drags the country and more than one million Earthquake survivors continue to live in shops, a great deal of abstinence is expected.
At the moment, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they failed to do so because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents, necessary for voting, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors believe that the choice of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, according to the patent, the Haitians also think so.
Moving points towards the center
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased its popularity index by 20 points, up to 50%, the highest level that has been recorded since her election in 2007.
Despite all this, which can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in the coming elections, it will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández abandons the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who was still in charge of economic policy even after his wife had succeeded him as president, had the custom of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax income, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs Fernández's government lost most of her in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened since Kirchner's death due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some discrepating members of the Peronist movement in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after a chaotic session in which one MP gave one punch to another in the face and other MPs accused the bribe government, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget, therefore, will be applied next year, which will offer the President an even greater margin of action when it is spent.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1 per cent, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage requirements of the trade unions, are about 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who assumed power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made poverty growth and poverty reduction its priorities rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and made the INDIC, the Institute of Statistics, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández fashion these policies now?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its officials claim that they want to limit wage increases to 18 per cent next year.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum for growth achieved with a major deevaluation in 2002.
Perhaps it is because Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bond holders who had refused a forced restructuring prior to the debt that Argentina had not subscribed in 2001.
Currently, it seems that Ms. Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the credible governments grouped at the Paris Club, which is due about $6,700 million.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is usually the case.
Last month, however, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to develop a new price index for national consumption, which seems prelude to the cleaning of INDIC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to pursue politics when his mandate is over, given that he no longer has his husband on his side.
If you do, you will need to earn the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of the Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacations in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not to give up, in a calm manner, many of your husband's policies.
China's Half-Spirits
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
How does Taiwan feel about his great brother on the other side of the narrow?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of the electors, came on 27 November to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what seems to be a broad assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a defender of the feelings of the continent, creating innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but slowly.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five elections to the mayor, he failed to obtain the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPD), which has been driven by Taiwan's total independence, received almost 50 per cent of all votes against 45 per cent of KMT.
If they were the Presidents, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the voting rate of his party has decreased by about 8 per cent.
For the first time, the PPD got involved with KMT in the cities.
In the elections, the typical elements of Taiwanese elections were seen, including noisy campaign trucks and large agglomerations with banders and light girls dancing clothes.
Nor did he fail the mysterious attempted murder of rigor.
Sean Lien, Lien Chan's son, honorary president of KMT, was campaigning for one of KMT's candidates the night before the elections.
A man from the crowd shot the young man directly to his face, wounding him and killing a transeon.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or avenge himself of the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, seeding suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean on the KMT.
Perhaps the only great winner of the campaign was China.
It turned out surprising that the issue of the continent was not dealt with in itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Therefore, KMT often avoids advertising its links to the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging the feeling against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma said it had been confirmed that his policy on China was acceptable to most Taiwaneses.
It is expected that the Government of Beijing will continue to subjugate them to trade, in accordance with its strategy to ensure that Taiwan returns to the line.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
No doubt you would also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
The best is to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to do so.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned for corruption.
The President, between 2000 and 2008, was openly instigating explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as a candidate for the PPD for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who has fulfilled his mandate under Chen.
Now your party is doing everything possible to show that it can also have relationships with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced the plans for the creation of a group of experts acting as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that prior-condition negotiations could be carried out.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr Chen seems angry about the change.
In a statement issued from their cell, he stated that PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to present himself to the presidents.
Even without the intervention of Mr Chen, the PPD will have difficulties in choosing among its potential candidates.
KMT should also carry out an examination of consciousness.
Mr Ma's ratings have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; KMT's candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity seems mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A spokesperson from KMT says he will restructure his office as well as local equipment.
The large samples of the PPD suggest that Taiwan's support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprising choice in the category of Artist revelation.
Act at the request of a president, and perhaps people will set themselves on you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer personally selected by President Obama to act at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, submitted one of the Grammys surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Considering that Spalding has been a cheered jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Experence", the nomination gives what to think, but respects the Grammys rules that he must be an artist who has not taken more than three albums to the market before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", was undoubtedly a great advance and, taking into account its light and pleasant voice style, as well as a great skill with pop, funk and Latin rhythms, one can at least establish a distinction between Spalding and the way to success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammys voters, who have recently concentrated in the field of jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "History", an exciting and magnificent record that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is the veteran saxophoneist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and the techist John Beasley by "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite stripper in New Orleans and a regular guest in "Treme" from HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest tends significantly towards fusion as in the albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society's wild punk won a deserved recognition in the category of large groups, competing against the big jazz camera of Billy Childs Ensemble and always risked Dave Holland, whose live album with his octopus, "Pathways", was a great example of the Lower Democratic Leadership of his band.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classic albums
The nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine", by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for three-motion eclectic orchestra.
The Estonian composer Arvo Pärt is among those nominated with links to southern California for his symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a play by the Philharmonic of Los Angeles and set off at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based on Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also appointed by his Mandolin Concerto.
Classic music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestra, opera, coral and solo albums.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominated: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner by Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey by "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg by "Luu" of the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers appointed to a Grammy by contemporary compositions include Pärt by Symphony No. 4, Daugherty by "God Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze by "Appassionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg by "Graffiti" and Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's No. 4 Symphony broke out at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a meeting recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, headed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes, is attached to "The Angels" and is dedicated to the old magnate of the oil Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concert" is appointed by the soloist performance instrument with orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for her to play Mandolin Avi Avital, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"The composition with the sounds of the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms of North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old director Pierre Boulez was appointed to the category of orchestra function, leading the Chicago Symphonic Orchestra during a recording of works by Stravinsky.
Among the appointed instrumental soloists are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominated as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sophie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Bruegergosman.
In the category of classic mixture, the soprano Jesse Norman was named for his recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula obtains the approval of the Management Committee
The draft mosque for Temecula has received unanimous support from the local committee after more than five hours of public witness, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying that it fosters terrorism and traps.
However, the members of the committee decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive from a aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Bahaish, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic centre of the Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"Protests that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimum," he adds.
"Only they speak very loud."
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was dedicated to people who intervened in favor or against the centre, almost the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper website.
"The United States no longer exists", is read in one of the comments.
"This is another planet of seeds with Mrs Libertad dead in the arena."
"America has fallen."
The plans for the construction of Islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the attacks of 11 September 2011 occurred.
In the Valley of Temecula, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has reported acts of violence.
Her congregation of about 135 families has been living for years without problems in the Riverside county, but she wanted a bigger and better place than the warehouse that rented in a shared property with a water filter system manufacturer.
The new 24.943 square foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres in Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents may still refer the project to the Municipal Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients broadens the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and, possibly, on other planets.
Although researchers have discovered the interesting bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life forms are possible without the main elements that they considered essential.
"This body has a dual capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That makes it very peculiar, although little is needed to be a truly 'foreigned' kind of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the online edition of the publication of Science on Thursday.
For a long time it has been considered that there are six major elements of life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus by arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what it is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, finding is important for searching for life on different planets on Earth, as researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it has.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press wheel to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated a great Internet speculation about the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "is evidence that in other planetary environments, there might be organisms that use other elements to stimulate their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider essential for life may not be so fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element by another in the basic biochemical and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not carried out by accident.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrobiology, who conducted the study, focused on the Mono Lake because she has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, it may be difficult for agencies to differentiate them."
"However, arsenic is quite different than so that it does not work as well as phosphorus, so it comes in and, by some means, appellates biochemical machinery," Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing arsenic concentrations, to which they were adapted and used to grow.
The microbio grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that it can naturally exist a form of life that uses arsenic, whether in other areas of the Earth or in another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, pointed out that the idea that the arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example has never been found to prove that it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early ages of the Earth, he pointed out, so researchers speculated that the early forms of life could have used it.
"So it suggests that there might be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in ancient times," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The stolen dogs missing in Compton have been found
The two dogs were found missing from the four thieves in front of the Bellflower motel, according to the officers of the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, as the authorities said.
Two of the canines recovered in the afternoon and the two others found themselves in the afternoon, late in the evening, as Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the sheriff's department of Los Angeles County, reported.
"The good news is that dogs are well," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They've returned with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"He's doing an investigation."
"We don't want to say anything," said Whitmore.
"We're following some leads."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to make a comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had no damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek wanted to show in the competitions in the area this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, continued to disappear until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend and had the intention to show Trace.
The other dogs were going to show them in other competitions scheduled for the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, as Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops in the almost two-month tour that the couple takes part in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of their room.
They took three other dogs (one boxing house, one Parson Russell terrier and one Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and they would be fresher.
They left the windows slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van on Tuesday at 6:00 in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was not clear whether a reward would be given.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM achieves the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light to start again.
On Thursday, a New York Federal Bankruptcy Judge officially approved the “prearmed” plan by creditors to erase approximately $5 billion of debt, extending the way for the 86-year entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and outside of films and television programmes.
The outcome of Thursday confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to be brought back under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned credit instrument of $500 million to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the loan, which on its behalf is contributing $75 million, and it is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the Investment Bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management needed to manage its finances, while struggling to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron, and expert in the recovery of companies in failure, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve the financial tribulations of MGM and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the study required much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009, the parties agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few depositors and no willingness to pay the more than $2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
Before spring this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal debate and disagreements, was finally supported by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially exits the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multimillionaire bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper companies, which have been collecting $375.000 a month for their company management services, will receive a 4 million “successful fees”.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production in MGM, which only took a film this year, and gathered an annual pie of seven or eight films that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The study needs a separate loan of $265 to $275 million to finance its part of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep the balance of his gift budget
While iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy of this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant apple in your gift budget.
Consider that at the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes of $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump strings decorated with accounts, or about 48 pages of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to maintain your budget for gifts in balance.
Recently I visited three national toy salesmen, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wolesale Club, to see what electronic toys could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law had been working; this year's technological toy would probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most famous of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And players driven by button stacks are increasing, as well as players with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" You, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are pellet toys of the size of a cobby singing a note when their belly is tapped.
A pendulum is equal to a note, and a second pendulum begins to build a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start pressing, you can't stop.
For combined dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking advantage of Elmo Live technology last year, the 14-inch animated doll plays turnover games like Simóm Dice, and can take the moon step, thanks to its innovative feet with wheels with locking device.
The kids who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, even though their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a bag full of questions cards designed to convert a car ride into a session with a range of self-correction exercises happening.
If you are afraid to give your child your smart phone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
MobiGo of VTech ($60, 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although the games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, 3 to 12 years), it is the first important point of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL (90 dollars, 3-7 years old) uses an iTunes-type system to present games and electronic books, and has a SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a five-block game just bigger than a lock box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to arm words by putting the blocks in line before the time is over; it is formidable for an improvised competition of armed words.
There are more and more players who have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your son an online pet at the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, from 6 to 12 years old) which includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you change the online code, your child gets enough credits at the Penguin Club store for two items.
These could include belts on wheels or a Puffle pet toy.
A little bigger than his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last on a microbot line powered by button piles.
The false insect moves quickly over 12 silicone legs that vibrate, in random directions.
It's fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even pass a mouse inside the mouth of our dog.
A more moderate side of order maintenance is being promoted in China
As a urban instructor, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a city square, carefully inspecting the nervous people in their charge, issuing low-voice orders with military authority.
He wanted the women's members to come, the corrupt policemen of China's urban order, afraid and despised by their capricious energy measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Sign me!"
"Look out!"
Show them, she said, "How beautiful girls are!"
Four girls who just spent adolescence with white gloves and green olive jackets identical and adjusted pants to call attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed above the hair tied with blue and white rays.
"Personally, I think you have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, distastefully.
"Models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clear the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
Guangdong Province changed the gray green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force for intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers circled on a snack cart, and observed it with the ground constantly half an hour, until the ambulance vendor picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, specifically elected by its appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the police lady a softer side, female.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's infinite respect for these city squadrons.
And for good reason, the critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city orders, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, Inspectors of the Province of Hubei killed a transeon after using their cell phone to film them while disbanding a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was hacked and published online, where it described how to effectively beat criminals without bleeding them.
This year, an ambulance salesman from Shanghai suffered brain damage after a kidney with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for download online, presents inspectors trained by the Chinese who attack street vendors.
"Chenguan has left a scar in the government," lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy on tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a truly mythical cleaning".
The skeptics say that the current approach is far from that.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News was asked whether women had real duties or were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district's notice asked for female candidates from 18 to 22 years old, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They should have a height above the average, above 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said that work was physically too hard for women over 25 years of age.
"Your image is the important thing," said an anonymous district official to Rednet.com, a top government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities".
They reach out to women are like flowers, he said, and added, "In addition to being flowers, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city administration office of the district, is not anxious to support that description.
But he noted that the height requirements were standard in many Chinese work notices for both sexes.
Then comes the requirement for harmonious facial features.
If this means bet, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the minor or defigured should not be presented.
"We can't let a crazy person or a jorobodo come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang Plaza near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its colorful cheeks and a subtlely curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent in her aspect is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old workmate Xu Yang said "Our work should present the image of the city".
They also did not oppose their work at a certain time, they said, because they were pursuing greater career ambitions than simply putting on sellers in the alleys where they were supposed to circumscribe their business.
Each morning, the squadron faces more than a dozen foot-and-mouthed and bicycle salesmen, trying to sell as many pancakes or tofu cups as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu while a salesman was running away, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-driving car with fiddles.
Officials describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausters.
"This is more or less the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who is studying marketing in his free time.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the sellers' market.
They can only threaten to denounce the offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of hostility against bureaucracy, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, were moved to spread the false rumor that some officers had murdered a salesman.
More than a dozen policemen or gangsters were injured in the nighttime episode; 14 government vehicles were robbed or taken by fire.
For the time being Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is only guaranteed.
Only two streets from the peaceful Plaza Baoguang, where women's officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired in the yard instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle screamed grotesquely.
The situation was delayed for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened their way to their vehicles and were quickly with the motorcycle and their owners.
Li Xuedong, 40-year-old, a co-ordinator assigned to the male squadron, remained behind, with his white badge given back to conceal his name.
As women officials, coordinators, 40-year-olds or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li with total nature.
"Most of the time is the public who starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced Wednesday that the prosecutors of the Department of Justice had excused Senator John Ensign from the criminal charges that had arisen from his affair with an ex-con campaign assistant and his efforts to ensure work through lobby for the wife's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat faced by Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his business had national holders last year and damaged his career.
The Ensign office said it felt "surely happy" for the decision, which came after an investigation of a whole year.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure of the Senate's ethics committee.
Ensign lawyers said that the Department of Justice had informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plan to raise charges against him on this issue.
The Department of Justice did not wish to comment on the case.
The ad was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have been involved in violating a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
The interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first released in October 2009 at the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative work through lobby, to achieve Hampton's silence and his wife, Cynthia, on the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as the treasurer of a Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton's work and appealed on behalf of them after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the law to make lobby for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving by lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees to use their connections to do personal business.
Of the evidence that has been made public, "it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door status," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious in accepting political proceedings after several important revisions for its public integrity section, including the last year's decision to abandon proceedings against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the middle of charges for misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowardly," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of defenses that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, chief counsel at Ensign, said in an interview that received a telephone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice on Monday and another call the following day, saying that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign's defence team had been cooperating with the prosecutors in an attempt to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable entering into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a complaint separate from the ethics group, claiming that a payment of $96,000 from Ensign's parents to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was only a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had supported the senator for a long time, which obtained work through lobby thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, the head of Ensign's office, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was "miscending" the Ministry of the Interior on a controversial issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and other Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to do lobbying.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his voters and abandoned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, Ensign told reporters that he planned to post a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's voice, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would follow the example of the Department of Justice quickly and complete its investigation.
"Sentor Ensign wishes to continue with his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will show on Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chat" in the rows of the courtroom.
A minute or so, they sent reports of the terrible witness via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that approached the rape and children attached to their beds in a house that was caught by fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire family, Connecticut, is ready to arrive at an official end, with the conviction of the judge of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have submitted written statements in the court that outline the arguments of appeals that are likely to be before the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by media journalists, created "a circular atmosphere", and such a generalized and immediate saturation with excellent details made public passions exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force appeals judges to deal with the question of whether new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief defense lawyer of Mr Hayes.
The first instance judge Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme State Court, laconically rejected the claims in a failure last week, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been led by passion.
But it will probably not be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the appeals courts have recognized that coverage of celebrity cases can generate questions about the impartiality of a trial.
In a historic case in 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States withdrew the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell, who had "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television program and the film "El Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later could be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be necessary to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general concern about the impact of the new media" in high profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of Stanford's School of Laws, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report stating that it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials more just.
The Twitter issue is just one of many of the topics outlined by Hayes lawyers, who will probably be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes might have been harmed when the Blue Judge refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jury members, showing them speculative photographs of the crime scene during the jury selection.
Some jurymen have said they were terrified by the victims' photographs, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11.
Defence lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge wrongly removed a jury that had criticised the prosecutors, and that he wrongly pressed for a verdict for his unusual decision to order the jury to decide for a week.
The jury was not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process may attract most of the interest.
They observed in a refusal to the verdict archived last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media kept firing wood at the fire of emotion on the case.
"The daily accumulation of tweets from the media, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and maybe in the whole state."
Your attention in Tweeter's coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports submitted more slowly was a controversial vision that would make the court's policy on coverage weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the courts of appeal were often attracted by the arguments on the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressuring for that claim.
In his letter, he referred to the decision of 1966 of the Supreme Court, which revoked Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the cover of the trial, and made it clear that they would require new means to require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the twenty-first century."
Can the citizen hold a bridge to join the divisions?
After a notable campaign for invectiveness and negativity, a little civilism has been triggered this week in Washington.
Is it a prelude to genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusionary moment before a quick return to the fight against the party in the capital?
The meeting of Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not make any progress on the major issues to be addressed during the upcoming meeting.
But what everyone said was at least a brief discussion on the differences between the two sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to win the party points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the Chairman's Deficit Committee was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is only enough to say that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a trial period, each seeking to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
The reason why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent evaluations of the same were made by the participants with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and are very deeply rooted as to suggest any rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is tax, expenditure, health care or social assistance, both parties are in the opposite.
However, November's election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way things are said," said Pete Wehner, an officer of Bush's administration now at the Centre for Public Ethics and Policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections wake up party passions, which then disappear.
That's good."
In some matters, particularly those on the agenda of the upcoming meeting, the Republicans and Democrats have no option but to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions are won at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to increase unemployment subsidies, probably because Republicans cannot believe that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, refusing unemployment subsidies for the unemployed.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism about a possible deal on these issues during the upcoming meeting, together with the ratification of the new START Nuclear Disarmament Pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institute, warns that successful cooperation in the emerging issues will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanism when the new 112th. Congress meets in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement would begin.
"After what needs to be done is done, in the short term, psychology will reverse the situation to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civilism can lead to genuine cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a trial for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the formation of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who have made a decisive contribution to its creation.
More aware that the Republican leaders have the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they must try to fulfill their promises to cut off state spending and abolish the new health law.
These baselines are already clearly observed in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include reform of the tax code and the increase of some taxes and the retirement age, and the cost cut.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken care of one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own evaluation, have introduced the issue of the deficit in the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The biggest resistance is among the officials elected in the panel, suggesting that there are at least few bases or wishes for commitment in tax matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of the Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of party shocks, when the Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of increased bilateral cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanism of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties will observe closely the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks he's losing will probably change course and look for commitment.
However, this can be an optimistic view.
Partisanism and polarization are now larger than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the only prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common points on issues that still divide them.
An American filtered document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "cleptocracy", and leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money that goes directly to Kremlin, according to the U.S. Embassy in Russia in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each strata of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical authority", takes part as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyle, was published by WikiLeaks on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor of Moscow, and he blamed him for most of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of cleaning since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have systematically denied corruption charges over the years, and he has won several verbal claims on such charges.
In September, when a Russian television channel asked him about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he said, "It's crazy, it's a boss, it's a mess."
According to the polls, the Russians believe in an overwhelming way that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of to be the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
"The direct slogans of the Moscow city government with crime have led some to call it "disfunctional", and to affirm that the government works more like a cleptocracy than as a government," says the note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means 'stechy' or protection) that crosses the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the government bureaucracy in Moscow.
"Analysts identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, the common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects the money from the largest companies, and that the police point to small businesses.
One source, stated the report, "explained that Moscow's trade owners understand that it is best to obtain the protection of MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law".
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their business closed by a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has acknowledged that he has made little progress.
The embassies note informs about men taking bags, probably full of cash, within the same Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust bureaucrats," said George Satarov, director of the Indem Group of Experts in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no political class in Russia anymore."
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified as 154 (the countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy's note, which did not happen until late at night in Moscow, will surely cause resentment within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for Kremlin to argue that the problem is being solved.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation that claimed that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way."
The veterans of the Red Jemeres forced to face the past
In a concrete class that was illustrated, with smeared walls, the director of the Anlong Veng Secondary School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemeres Ta Mok.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and worried about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the Carnicero" for its brutality during the government of the Red Jemeres, the commander continues to be popular in this remote ex fortitude of the Red Jemeres in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemeres surrender to the government, the long-lasting loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face those who had participated in the regime publicly.
In June, the government distributed here a secondary school text book that for the first time teaches the story of the Red Jemeres to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations and Cambodian mixed court issued the first conviction of a former member of the Red Jemeres, judging the former head of the well-known torture centre Tuol Slang, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Red Jemeres of Anlong Veng, complicated efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate themselves into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Red Jemeres, but they can't do anything," Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, said an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Jemeres was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the government of the Cambodian Red Jemeres, between 1975 and 1979, some 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and defeated the government led by Pol Pot, the regime's remains and its military fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last move that was made in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the war of guerrillas from their bases in the mountains and forests of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Jemeres fighters began to desert the government, culminating in the performances of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of its benefactors, the former Red Jemeres fighters fell into the absolute misery common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite officials of the Red Jemeres maintained their local administrative positions instead of depositing their weapons, race soldiers remain poor and unqualified farmers.
"These people have gained little benefit after surrender," Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation said, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were created without any concept of doing business."
Sir Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemeres when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the forest near Anlong Veng before spending his life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemeres was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave her to eat everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to get rid of ourselves."
The current Court of the Red Jemeres has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, it is expected that the court will begin trial in Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Red Jemeres.
The mandate of the court is to prosecute the leading leaders and those of greater responsibility for the crimes, but it has not stated whether it will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This wasn't much used to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent speculation of the media has focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who was a district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the government of the Red Jemeres in late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of Trapeang Thma Prison, a project in which thousands of forced workers were thought to have died.
During a recent autumn afternoon, Im Chaem again worked in the fields at his house on wooden pilots on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun poured out long shadows over the harvest meal, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemeres.
She said that if the court did not bring her before.
"Camboya is in peace and stability," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted the Red Jemeres in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court prosecutes more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Camboya must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to move forward, Chhang Youk said, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first text book approved by the government on the Red Jemeres, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the book of secondary school history of the Ministry of Education, which contains fewer than four pages on the Red Jemeres.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Red Jemeres, despite the city's link to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at the Anlong Veng Secondary School, said that the new text book helped students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the text book and the court," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will process."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the text book and the court are beginning to produce an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Jemeres preserves a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weed and covered plastic bags of waste leads to a rectangle of the black holine covered by an oxidized roof of silk.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of tyres after its death in 1998.
Noum Sothea, a 31-year-old cell salesman on the side of the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was burned there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place go there to pray to him," he said.
It was the birthday of Noum Sothea, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last rest, where he would leave a handful of mature bananas with the hope of good luck.
Belarus accepts to give up its qualified uranium reserve for weapons
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would give up its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement published after the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the edge of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to renounce its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point without returning last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that a couple of operations were carried out with Belarus in the last two months, to withdraw 84.82 kg of uranium qualified for weapons of a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from the anonymous due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the 47 nations chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And in view it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This proves that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised Prague to protect all nuclear material worldwide in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never renounce its uranium.
"We have preserved highly enriched uranium ( hundreds of kilograms of what is basically qualified uranium for weapons) and low-rich uranium," Lukashenko said at that time.
"This is our raw material... we're not making dirty bombs, and we're not selling them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, showing interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials claimed that the first task of removing the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, since the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was done on a plane.
The US government spent $13 million on tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with low-rich uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of Energy working in the Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen confidence" which led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of qualified uranium for weapons, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reservation by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression of Lukashenko on human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential distance.
It was stated that "As progress is welcomed in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus acknowledged that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue to improve bilateral relations, and is essential for the country's progress and its citizens".
The Spanish Government did not respond to CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not respond to the CIA's flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda directed to Guantanamo by Spanish territory, as the US ambassador in Madrid said on a telegram.
This is reflected in the paper filtered (cable) by Wikileaks on the El País newspaper, where it is added that then the Government's first vice-president, Maria Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they were exercising appropriate surveillance over foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe in which he accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between former US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández of the Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken Zapatero's Government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"From Vega he stressed that Spain does not have intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "defeated pillage," Aguirre reports on a cable.
The then holder of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Angel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "would like to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, in the hands of judges, the Government had limited influence".
For his part, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge's initiative to request the classification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. reflected its concern about the "appearance of coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors", rather than the classified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to deal discreetly with the case between Governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007 at a lunch between the US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "Although the Spanish judges are fiercely jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of rhetorical inflammation in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action in this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not doubt capitalizing any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US Government," he points out.
Parricide confessed to complaining on the "agobio" network of being a mother
The young man was talking about the boy when he was already dead and he had a blog: "Terrorism in the Gallagh"

It wasn't long before she met another boyfriend.
The elected was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring town.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to investigate the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even got to accompany her to Palma for a week.
But because of the content of the communications, it is seen that his novel was broken, that they broke.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and mosquitoed, because I have come to work."
"When I said it seemed good to him, but of course, he now realizes what it is to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
Then he talks about a message to the cell phone he just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me a direction to send you to the child."
She complains, "If she doesn't like me leaving the cricket with my mother, I'll pick it up when she comes back," she says.

He's talking about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He'll go there (the boy) to some summer classes, and so I save a little bit of the song."
The 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Says Alberto who sent you I don't know what videos to the e-mail, look how you want to find me, you gotta fuck."
The 30th, another: "The boy is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's making me money."
On the Internet there are your messages in blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the universe of MySpace, now involved, where he was called "Muki the excarclerator."
"Terror in the gallega (epigrapher)."
The last man who lived with her, keeps her sworn, declares her grief for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to believe that everything happened because he didn't tell him he was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, from the centre of judicial detention in Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he did not remember how the events happened, "not having intended to cause any harm to the minor."
Earlier, he confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the pool and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
Populars would win 4 seats at Congress and PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MPs experienced in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP is already taking a look at the generals because, whether advanced or not, the prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes that this training receives in these committees is often doubled to what it receives in Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans received 610,473 votes in general in 2008, while in the 2006 autonomy, the figure rose to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC achieved 384,091 votes.
If this trend is maintained, which has been fuelled by a transfer of PSC votes and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections are held, the PSC could go from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CIU would also win four (now 10) and PSC would lose nothing less than 9 MPs (it has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose a MP - now he has three - while ICV would remain with a MP or win one.
But, if the election calendar is maintained, the most immediate date will be held in May 2011 with municipal commissions, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in its response to the Barcelona Deputation, one of the most budgeted administrations - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Nationalists as well as popularists coincide with the possibility that the PSC loses the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not get the majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be debarred that this formation loses its representation in the Barcelona Consistency - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can play a role in the Tarraconense capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has located only 500 votes in the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they have been found on several occasions.
Populars have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in as many populations as possible.
Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaida
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by agents of the General Police Information Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaida, including "Tigres for the Liberation of the Land of Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the author of the last of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "Kampai operation" the Al Qaida falsification apparatus has been "weaked" at the international level and, therefore, "their operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrate the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that its "combatants" can cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The disarmed cell is not the only one that the jihadist network has been operating in Europe, so that in addition to Thai services, other European police units have participated in the investigations, so it is not clear that in the EU territory there are hits similar to those carried out last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatounde Agunbiade), another development took place in Thailand with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Siranglaya Kybumrung.
These were the ones who led the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - stole mainly to tourists passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents should be on behalf of men aged 25 to 45 with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
In the research it is emphasized that no data has been found at the moment that links the arrested in Catalonia with the attack of Bombay, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", has been one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, since Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "inverted" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the "command" members who ended up with the lives of 106 people.
The police have been inundated with extensive documentation.
PP requires Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Arthur But his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generality, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which sum up giving priority to the recovery of the economy and disregarding philo-soveranist adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to place in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans came to the meeting of Arthur Mas with the security that he had obtained 18 MPs in the last Sunday's elections, which is more than enough to be desired, as the CIU candidate needs at least one of the trainings that will exercise the opposition to abstain from the investment vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to keep in Congress when general elections are held, but, at the moment, the talks they hold today, but with the rest of the political leaders, they are held in the Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investment "will have to park all the sovereign and independent speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque country - that the convergence leader even intends to submit to referendum.
Both leaders share their commitment to accumulating the political apparatus of a very inflated autonomous administration and eliminating the tax on inheritances and donations.
The details of the negotiations on the investment of Mas will be taken up by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Christmas (PSC) - which promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Catalan Solidarity).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not "failure of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot don't waste their cell phone killing more than 11 elders
The jurors of La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press call to highlight the damage the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé had caused to the institution, the nurse who, while employed there, killed at least eleven elders who were in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the centre, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be able to carry out the charge against the responsible" of the deaths but "legality and responsibility compel us to assume the procedural situation of civil liability".
And in addition to the social degradation that the entity may suffer because it has not detected the criminal activities of the celebrator in time, the great threat to La Caritat now entails a substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' families are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and has since not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old patients of the geriatrics - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased, but that, in caring for the age and the pathologies of the patients, the treatment by telephone was dismissed.
The Caritat, through its director, repeatedly denied this extreme yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures can at no time be the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no single indication in the case that there has been an unwise action by any other person who is not the accused".
He was already baptized as "Angel de la Morte" in front of 11 murders and detailed that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 for a month and a half later to kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by pinning an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by using a mixture of sedated pills.
The Director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the centre have access to medicines.
The insulin stains and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his affront to alleviate the suffering of the interiors, used to kill them.
But it will be the analysis that is being carried out in the laboratory that must clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, she embraces them as she has already confessed that she did with the three women who killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the cello, nor even to the number of confirmed murders, which do not deny that they are superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in her visits to the judge and in the little sense that she has to change her way of doing after she has successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say that justice is made available to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB's threat
The investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday that warned "markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity".
Peripheral differentials have been forced to close and the European banks' shares have increased by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes, and the euro has only been a worrying signal.
What has happened yesterday is itself a wrongful market as it unfolds is recovered but motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will delay losing fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and we will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years and those remaining.
The Bundesbank required that the public debt purchase plan be terminated by inefficiencies and that all extraordinary liquidity measures be eliminated in time, leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bonus purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they fail to meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent response of the markets yesterday and if they are still obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, which God is watching us!
Just as at their May meeting, in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and collapsed markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, the basuka announced Monday and Wednesday that it had already bought a lot, causing a new market explosion.
Yesterday the auction of letters a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, the types in Portugal dropped 30 basic points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published.
The estimated figures are about 10,000 million in the short term and other 15,000 potentials and have until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and still lacks sufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax the tension towards the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which a political commitment is required to show that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the president had the opportunity to present yesterday with the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, reduction of deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to re-activate employment are in the ears of investors such as the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Bag has increased by 4.5%, the double that the rest of European Bags.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and decisive and we are benefiting from the surprising effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bonus that will be benefited by the Trichet effect so we expect it to be resolved with strong demand and help resolve the doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Aid Plan would be self-inflamed.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 4 billion in liquidity available the triple that in March, to lovely types and closes your access to the markets without dite.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being it, it must seem".
Spirit, we can.
Eulen's president will challenge the council of Vega Sicily requested by his children
The time does not run out in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founding member of the group, will challenge her, in considering her as "full-right void", the court board of El Enebro on the next day 16, requested by five of her seven children and in which they will try to make most of her and deal with the management bodies of the firm titled Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Maria José are finishing the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their fight for control by the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem willing to surrender in his dispute to be present in the government bodies of El Enebro.
Out of his board of directors, five of his seven children who were appointed administrators at the 18 January meeting of shareholders this year and whose objection is noted in the Mercantil Register.
The court board of El Enebro for the next 16th day, convened by the Magistrate of Mercantil No. 2 of Madrid, has re-opened the box of the Truens in the Alvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the Board's summons.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants for his five children to, through procedural argument, in clear fraud of the Law and abuse of the law, try to validate and heal the radically null board of 18 January", according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis on which, once the Board is convened, the appeal is brought when it considers it to be "a nullity of full law".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully tried to bring the magistrate together in June.
In El Enebro, a real estate company and head of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims the use of 51 per cent of the capital, according to family protocols.
This is the substantive issue that the judge must decide upon once the view on the appeal is held, for which there is no date yet to be stated.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
A software designs car improvements in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this selective universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a newly arrived shield and, in spite of the rising journey of the last season, last November, in the final straight of the championship, they all bet by the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without discriminating the ability as a pilot of the final champion, German Sebastian Vettel, nor the engine's ability to drive Renault, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that Germany placed on the market in 2007 for very far-off purposes of the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design manufacturing factory assembly chains around the world, energy plants, high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable errors and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan's most famous commercial cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Siemens industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 fact-finding has enabled Red Bull to design and carry out "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements that are detected during the race and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that the shields in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their equipment capable of introducing a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each season.
At the Red Bull team today, 180 young high-skilled professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of changes in the balloons.
The director of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull balloons with the exception of the engine, which is entirely Renault's responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be made from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production through lasers and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness in technological improvement is the $40 million figure that each Formula 1 team can spend as much as possible in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech factory to design and produce its balloons in a locality about 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret."
The template for this performance amounts to 580 people, including its two pilots, the Vettel and Mark Webber champion.
The hero of Red Bull's Formula 1 is undoubtedly the recent Sebastian Vetell champion.
Among the vast technological resources that the energy drinks brand has put in service for its participation in the circuits, other protagonists are hidden whose competition is invaluable and their zero notoriety.
The manufacturer's chief of technology, Steve Nevey, said that five years ago it could be said that I+D advances in road cars brought 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have varied and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while pilots bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey recognizes that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install its own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive in collaboration yesterday in Barcelona is his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-market centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, set as an example the remodeled shop located in the Grand Barcelonian Via, owned by Pont Reyes, who has been working with him for 30 years.
The US group has prepared a plan to place 200 brand points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being Barcelona's third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Director of HP Personal Systems also ensured that the philosophy of installing shops will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The US Group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of shops (with products that can be played in an interactive way), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff of establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that this was a system of franchise and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve service to the customer and the SMEs in the purchase, care, postage and even packaging".
The Barcelona Store includes a space with a global pilot program that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP computer equipment in guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht, Holland.
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, as large companies already have technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bet for 'robar' a million customers to their rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, Banko Sabadell's deputy advisor, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it provides for a fluctuation of the margins of interest, which will try to compensate in part with commission increases and the price of the credit.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private customers, their outstanding assignment.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and can survive in a very complicated economic environment.
In 2011, the Bank will launch a new management plan that will have a three-year validity.
The objective, in addition to surviving without having to resort to the public aid of the FROB, is to gain market share with the capture of a million new private customers -700,000 if those who can get out of the bank - its large outstanding allocation, as so far it has been taking more to the SMEs and companies than to the retail client.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment for productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks today dare to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has transpired all the plans of the world bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year's Optima Director Plan, set four years ago, although it was initially for three years, but the market situation made it expand a further exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main target.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "hard and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, believes that the end of the crisis in Spain will be "slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And although he believes that the passive war - which penalises margins - is being reduced, the price of risk premiums that are paying banks and cash for their emissions to obtain liquidity is already moving to the credit price to compensate for the drop in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and funding is structural, and will be a pressure on credit."
"We haven't closed the grip, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto already ordered the Thursdays to his network to limit long-term credit and raise the price of differentials - see Fridays 22 and 27 November.
He also recognized that the bank's trend now "is to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not discard corporate operations.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain "you will require larger sizes."
"The coming year will move everything," he assured.
He claims that capital needs are "very high" and does not deny that any Spanish financial entity enters red numbers.
It points out that FROB can supplement the market in the acquisition of funds before new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remained important for some bankers to Vatican itself as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which depletes the crisis.
The ECSC rejects a second wave of mergers in boxes
The ECSC Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta dismissed yesterday that a wave of savings boxes were being produced and again insisted on the speed at which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When it started the process of concentration of Spanish savings boxes, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Cajas de Ahorros (ECCA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that this new wave of operations will take place.
"I believe that the largest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol to the group of the Civic Bank cannot be said to be a second round, which is adjusted."
"The majority is completely done; instead of 17 we may go to 13 or 14 but all major processes have already been covered by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated very much in that too," the director pointed out.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Aragón Guidelines and Executives (ADA), Olavarrieta has stated that the concentration process is being "at the fastest possible rate, and we need to be very satisfied with how it is going to take place in the times that, not now, were marked in business plans with the Bank of Spain," he stressed.
"Over 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to meet Basilea," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unfortunate views on the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we must be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured Spain that it had the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed it to those who put it on trial as a "failure of knowledge".
The directive pointed out that, within the current economic context, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings boxes, a system that has undertaken a "significant" concentration process and that "go as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank was very well off from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the Union as a whole.
Market tensions have caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, the regulation of private placement agencies or the abolition of the 426 euros of non-performance aid up to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the State lottery.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of President Felipe González, has joined in criticizing Chancellor Angela Merkel for his responsibility in resolving the current crisis.
How are these movements to be interpreted?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turn of Turkey in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which shocks it to maintain the old traditions of a good part of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany began to speculate about the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now seems science fiction, with a very favourable view, is about 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, is in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the countries of the cross-border, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government withdrew a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of differences between what Germany thought should do (tax rigour and stability plans in public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second in front gave the central European country when Merkel extended Greece's rescue decision.
It was then extremely critical, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and public opinion and published were very opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, requiring the reform of the Union treaties, to enable a country to be saved and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run at the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweet, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the reform process of the Union which enables those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although there is now a need to take measures that may not be very agreed upon, from that date on, the former operation of the euro will have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which criminal countries will be severely punished, may be required to be declared suspended and, in that case, the private sector will also run at the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a strong path of growth with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as that which has presided over Spanish growth in the years of boom, will simply not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand it.
This is not just about reversing public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand of us is much harder.
And the worst we could do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will lead to greater calmness.
And let us take advantage of the opportunity window that has been given to us, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism from Merkel, the thesis has been opened up that there must be ordering at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it doesn't seem to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, that of abandoning a monetary area that is too small to be taken seriously can not be excluded.
Then Germany can always tell us that it has already warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
Treatments such as those of Alonso and Ramos in front of the Ajax show ingenuity but not the will to escape a punishment.
The alleged expulsion by two Royal Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party disputed on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink streams to be written about whether or not such behaviour is anti-deportive and whether both players should be punished by UEFA.
As it is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (that your team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time in taking the wrong tracks to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid will end up as the leader of its group, both players will comply with the regulatory penalty the next party of the league, against Auxerre, and will be able to pass cards clean at the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned two parties to the team coach José Mourinho, and with different economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather often in the football world.
It is so extensive that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the discussion in the case reported is due to the fact that a team of the real Madrid entity (which in its age assumes nobility and honor, and has sometimes punished its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, who adds an episode further to its dilated history of historical and provocative technique.
In any event, the debate revolves around whether this type of conduct not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether such actions are unlawful; therefore, they are actions that are respectful to the sports regulation, but seem to be avoiding their meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm that causes the sports spirit.
One of the things that understands the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opponents, something that with these actions was not put at risk, i.e. there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that are allocated to the clean game is to prevent the team from using criminal players unfairly from using the opposite team, which did not happen either.
However, the paradox of the action of the Royal Madrid players is that it did not accommodate what we normally characterize as a fraud or fraud of law, because its violation of the rules was not hidden to try to avoid punishment, but precisely its action sought to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is what kind of advantage the offenders gain in the intentional shortcomings under consideration.
Here it seems necessary to note that there is no disadvantage to the rival or benefit in the same party, since the result of the action is obviously to leave the team with fewer players.
And it's also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club can't count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future party.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, as the team can be eliminated from the first exchange, and in addition to this action, players perform a penalty party and pass on to the second card cycle, in which the card accumulation suspension occurs with less than in the first cycle.
So, if you're going round, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
Finally, these actions do not oppose the sport spirit, which is part of strategic decisions that favour the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
Of course, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of fraud by law), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without getting the punishment or running away from it.
Although the border between engineering and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I believe it was a clear case of engineering.
The debate, I think, arises by two factors: because it was about two self-exulsion and the way in which the directive was transmitted to provoke them.
The damage caused to sports principles by these actions is not both ethical and aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture nave group dinners in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates on a set of reservations for the 16 and 17 days.
Self-suffrage celebrations are being extended by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tower and the lottery, with the arrival of December, the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen balloons for Barcelona's restoration and leisure, but which have resulted in a price-adjusted offensive in order to capture the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, the entrepreneurs and associations in the interviewed sector coincide.
To make accounting more complicated, this year's calendar (when Nochevieja fell on Friday) has concentrated the requests on the week of December 13, with the result until the date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (on 16 and 17) and only movement for the previous week.
As has already been happening since 2008, when the phase of flake cows began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners on a budgetary basis.
In order not to deviate from tradition, many workers keep paying their own pocket.
Regardless of the circumstances, some and others demand battle prices, the president of the Barcelona Restoration Village, Gaietà Farrás, confirmed.
The representative of the employer, today, does not dare to Vatican what this month's celebrations will be like.
"People think so much before booking."
"He wants to get out but he has the alerts on the price issue," he points out.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at good prices and with good service", adds, and remembers that customers tend to lower a level with the crisis, so that the gap around the 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey in various central establishments, the collapse of petitions for the night of 17.
In the Soteras Group, there is a genuine boom of applications for that Friday, with a claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the counture, with full formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early bookings, including from early November.
"We have made it impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros", they say.
In AN Group, which abandons El Mussol, Attic, QuQ, and up to a total of 23 locals, they remain optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second semester and some good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group point out that the 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who prefer parties.
The six group menus have added a swimmer, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as a cave.
They also see green pops in some companies that are again inviting their employees and feeling that the volume of the groups is something bigger.
On behalf of Patriot Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Bares Association, Restaurants and Ocio Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts to begin to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that the reservations are "animal", although customers "negotiated to the maximum".
Yes, the illusion of the feasts has not come down, paying who pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program generates great anxiety in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks filters confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear programme in Washington.
Apart from the clarifications and playful details that offer about the content of the talks and thoughts of US diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between both countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that weapons are not assembled but are still stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main causes of development in Washington.
Thus lists the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban attack, the noise-dispersed proliferation of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferation and reason for maintaining the guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear installations; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programmes," said Russian Foreign Minister Yuri Korolev, at a meeting with their American counterparts.
The latest documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani rate of nuclear weapons production.
A mission from the embassy in May, which calls communication with Pakistan "frustrating", maintains: "Transparency is often nonexistent; aid offers remain unanswered or discarded".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to leave "very clear" to the responsible that "the Pakistanian Army must end up with tacit support to terrorist groups".
To the hunt of chief Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the anti-terrorist struggle to avoid new filtrations.
Interpol sends a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange where it is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, it is not new, but it is the date of 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the last filtration of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents but with the charges of sexual abuse faced by the Australian in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks Creator's lawyer, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
It was the 20th day when the international police force headquarters in Lyon (France) issued the order at Sweden's request, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities in that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange "in view of its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as the organization has explained, consider the so-called network notice free to proceed to a arrest -- which must accommodate the national police body -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has angered Assange lawyers, who published a letter yesterday claiming that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to respond by videoconference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also remember that Assange requested and was allowed to leave Sweden from the prosecutor's case, compared to mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the security chief of Stalin.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the missive complains.
While the world is looking for it - and from Australia your mother defends the innocence of her son-- Assange continues on an unknown stand, but not silent.
On Monday, from an indefinite place, he gave an interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for ordering American diplomats who would spy on the United Nations by violating international treaties that the US has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was refuted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the petition "rejective and absurd".
"I'm not absolutely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," the CNN said.
Obama himself has been responsible for the anti-terrorist struggle, Russell Travers, to prevent new leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to remain important to Assange contrasts with the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, the congressman, who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber from January, asked the Department of State to examine the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and pursue their funds and any contribution or assistance from them".
Even further, Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian president Stephen Harper, has had to retreat after saying that Assange should "be killed".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, ex-Governor of Arkansas and possibly a presidential candidate.
"Anyone in the Government who filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not execution would be too kind a punishment," said Fox in the chain.
Puigcercos search for peace in ERC with guides to the likes of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to extract the ingenious internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC, with no north due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The party's president is aware that his resignation is insufficient for the followers of the exile Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that he can at all cause the head fractures that he had with other extensible currents.
For this reason, the Left leader will try to win the new critics with guins that allow him to wander to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercos announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers could speak about their continued secrecy.
Through paper, and not the hand raised.
If the Cardists want to drive a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of the line wants to avoid the image of division as well as submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that it would not be considered ratified with half the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would also not be a good result "to Bulgaria".
The next to Carod requires the president to do something more than make himself available for the campaign, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum body between congresses.
But when you don't have the majority enough to force resignations, they're going to try to agree with the executive a road map from here in May.
To this end, they look forward to participating in the preparation of the strategic re-orientation document that the Directorate will put to the vote on the National Council on day 18.
Its intention is to take down Puigcercós instead of promising to advance the convention in the fall of 2011, something that the dome already gives in fact.
The leader of the ERC acknowledged that the "polyphony" undermines stability and that his goal is to make the organization, once and for all, be able to wash the doors of dirty doors inside.
In this line, the article that the consultant on Joseph Huguet's functions signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovation said that the leader will be praised "for changing various goals".
And he listed five of them, two of them.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the campaign, i.e. to include new faces coming from the sector like Carod.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that the ERC liquid once the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes to allow conventions to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
To end with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish system of parties, has been an obsession with the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave left the direction to review the assembly at a specific convention on status reform.
This meeting is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years has been reluctant to deal with the matter.
Now, without critical sectors at stake, it can be a good time to take it back and try to close it forever.

According to the count of MILENIO State of Mexico, a decrease of four cases was recorded compared to 2010.
During November, 23 persons were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the content of MILENIO State of Mexico.

Next to him, the agents found a cartridge with a message.
Keeping China's objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of that country in COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supported his offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 per cent its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its bid to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, Su Wei, a representative of that country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, in the last four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work with the international community in that regard.
He noted that the Chinese climate change strategy was divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the adoption, last year, of a new Energy Act, which gathers the targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with states and locals to achieve energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, it was abundant, they are in progress or have already concluded several multiannual plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which had been implemented over the past five years and which had received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, another for the changing of incandescent focusses by savers and one more mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to that country's climate change government, assured that China's efforts have been greater than is generally thought of.
For example, the emissions per capita of greenhouse gases in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent over the last five years and planning to do so much more by 2020.
Attached to the legality expulsion of Spain: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN explained that the former Panist leader was in his right to approach the National Order Commission to claim what was appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, ensured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was attached to the rule of law and that the former Panista leader was in his right to approach the National Order Commission to claim what was appropriate to his right.
In a preliminary interview with Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case Espino's expulsion was a decision taken in the local area.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has his right, in his case, to appeal to the National Council's Committee on Orders, so that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, it clarified that it is not time to think in 2012 and that there has never been an alliance for presidential candidacy at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was told that National Action would be strengthened by the internal election of 4 and 5 December, in which he would have to elect his successor.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local election that was successful and achieved the goal," he said.
The Panist leader demanded that the PAN support 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the counter "we enjoy it and strengthen us", he said.
He said that the council will no doubt know whether to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, from which it will deliver the slogan "to whom the council determines."
"I have this absolute tranquillity and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the party president's office."
He predicted that the party's response in the past elections of 4 July will be reflected in the next contents, although "it's not yet time to think in 2012."
"For now it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this framework, he stressed that the three governments emanated from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be the reason for observation throughout the country, so that "many hopes, hopes are placed on them, and I am sure Gabino will be at the height of expectations".
When asked about the PR's criticisms to President Felipe Calderón for his speech within the four years of his government, César Nava called upon the priests to reflect on the sixies of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas of Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon; that they start defending them; that they leave the castle," he said.
He felt that the head of the Federal Executive could make statements like that made in his speech at the National Audit Office, because there was no biting or much less censorship in the country.
Promote Obama on Twitter law for undocumented students
"If you agree that adopting the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and install them to approve it is legislation," the president of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama now joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree that adopting the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and install them to approve it is legislation," Obama tweeted.
Its brief message maintains a cyber link with a broader document that calls on the public to communicate immediately with the senators, as the vote of the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that is expected soon, now is the time to make your voice hear," he points out.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the Bush tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade to the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a calendar for the rest of the projects could be set.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we need to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Senate democratic majority, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he would ask for a "conclusion vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or American Dream Law would legalize some 800 thousand young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the past five years and have joined a higher education institution or the army.
But the parties require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which requires the competition of a handful of Republicans, at a time when party organizations in the project advocate an intense calibre to ensure the approval of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Therefore, the parties to the Dream Act require a number of Republicans to join in the event that other Democrats decide to back up the initiative.
Among the most Courted Republicans are the senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing senator George Lemieux, from Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have declared that they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported John McCain has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger in the drawer
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where the participants made a gala of the story
"That's from The Sex in the Language I understand but... the finger in the Laga? what is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, invited to open the second round of The Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of her question (on another fair the round table was dedicated to The Sex in the Language, explained).
The finger in the lay... "puts us in love", the Argentine writer said to the public, mostly young people, who was quoted at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate round table by Marisol Shultz and where they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "lague" is, goes from a doctor, of which he does not get answers even though it is tracks in the same narrative thread.
Of the infectologist, he says: "Suffice is not my strength, maybe it's my leg."
Finally, after a frustrated approach to the traumatologist who stole his breath in the middle of the passage, but whoever makes it clear to him that it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the lie is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed and concluded "from the lay only to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very entertaining.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story that titled Elogio of the invention, where the finger in the lay is not named but is now discovered.
With magic realism brushes, a story of a famous witch, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired virtues that had lost a princess, a story that came to speak later America, the great novel that they had not missed since the beginning of their own chroniclers who counted it, and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo as criticizing the excess of the story by the conquering captains.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the fickle witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise they would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination that he lacked until the smile."
However, he pointed out "are the mad and the embittered ones who best imagine" and is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that narration belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its apogeum.
He actually calls it the "cervantine tradition."
"For your inheritance we are the things that are reckoned."
In turn, writer Mayra Montero welcomed and applauded the variety of interpretations that led to the FIL's invitation with its round table The finger in the drawer.
The Puerto Rican Cuban pointed its way towards the great scourge of social violence across its country - and shares Latin America - the product of drug trafficking and drug trafficking disputes.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs will conclude a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," he said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment established between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night the Spanish poet Luis García Montero closed it, whose speech also emphasized "the finger on the stick of the writer's committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual habits and control of the consciences that lead to dogmatism, forgetting "that behind each claim there is a small no and behind each denial there is a small yes."
"To be the owners of our thinking and to be the owners of reality we have to mat: and mating often means putting your finger on the stick and harassing those people who are much more comfortable thinking in cartoon, in black and white, in established and unmatched ideas and also harassing the powers that prefer a black and white world," he said, inviting to recover the meaning of writing.
Roman goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, has had heights in his career, but has already been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, has had heights in his career, but has already been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although it has so far gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up comforting with the medal of the sub-campeon, has remained a step behind the winners and has played consecutive endings with the same team.
The Holy Strategy reached its first final as a coach at the Open Tournament 2002 when it carried the Morelia rites with which it fell globally from 4-2 to Toluca; later, in 2003 it also reached the decisive duel and also lost it globally from 3-1 and was precisely before Rayados.
With Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, once again in front of the Devils, Rubén again suffered a turnout, as his team ended up with 2-2 in front of the choruses after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalts tank it was put in advantage by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three his players failed since the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 turnout.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same luck, seeks to get rid of the evil and can celebrate a title for the first time, although he says that the institution is the most important for him.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, that's for a club, that's for an affection I owe me, and therefore the title will come to me, but the earlier is the most important," said the Timonel when he was questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very current has the previous end, of which he assures, has learned much, "the only teaching we can have is that until the arbiter takes the end we can't celebrate, we're prepared on the track, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties for shooting we were already ready to run out and I think that's a lesson, until the party is finished we can celebrate".
To know that this series could be defined in criminal shots, something that does not bother you, because it trusts in its players: "You never seek to get to the penal court, one search to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no one else and you need to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately made us a bad game of fate, sometimes by the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in your hands, but if you left us, that left us something for this end that we hope not to reach that instance."
Roman has in his hands to stop being a sub-compeon technician and to prove for the first time the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules to get visas
People should visit Visa Requesters Service centres before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
With effect from 10 January 2011, the procedure for processing a visa will be changed at the United States Embassy and consulates.
With the new procedure, most applicants should visit Visa Requesters Service Centres (ACS) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will receive biometric information from the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer will be necessary to make a payment to conclude the date, another payment to process the visa application and more so that the mail service will deliver the document.
The vacuum cleaner will only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for a requested visa (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for commercial and investment visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but they will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their marks.
Because biometric information will be taken into the ASC, applicants who will need a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this less time than in the past.
Similarly, those who apply for visas in Consulates in Juárez, Monterrey and New Laredo will no longer pay the extra fee of $26.

NASA will announce extraterrestrial life find
The U.S. Space Agency quoted the press to present tomorrow with a discovery that will impact the search for living beings in space.
The National Administration for Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will introduce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory that there is an extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference Thursday morning at 13:00 in the headquarters of NASA in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When the press was quoted, NASA assured that it would present "a finding that would impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", resulting in speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures in our pair and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they would become intelligent beings like humans if they improved the conditions in which they live.
This seems to be a microbe found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some ways, the creature uses arsenic as a way of survival and this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our favorable atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will make known the true scope of the findings at the press conference on Thursday morning.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life in Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon in Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesture PRD, PT, Convergence and Block Pattern opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, they complain about the arrival of 'bipartidism'.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when an opposition block emerged at Congress, led by the MPs, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartidism' in the House.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patron Montalvo, ‘trona’ against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, starting with 'bipartisanism', because now there will be two people, equal to the number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four Members, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau Directive, led by the Panista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo explained that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality on the part of the PRI and the PAN.
He explained that in the next few days they will speak with PAN and PRI representatives to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be re-evaluated by both parties and the opposition coalition is over.
"To this end (the opposition coalition) has come, that is what I am looking at, because we are excluded from any decision, not even have the political distinction to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Pattern, there are coincidences and that is why they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, continued, that the Congress after being monopolies, is now "duopoly".
"It is not the spirit of reforming the law that there is eternal bipathism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other partners and partners to make them more, the convergence increased.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that the Congress was currently becoming a 'botin' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a party, now they're dividing it between two."
Mr Montalvo, asked for respect for the Member's personality, gave him his place at the negotiating tables.
"Not by collective agreements, we are left out of 5 that we are probably going to make 9 Members, avowed by the five who see us, separated into different groups, we have decided to unify ourselves to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the subject that in the reform that they made they agreed, we are gone, and we disagree with that reform."
$200 thousand more for "the supplier"
Pay City of Mazatlán another check to the questioned owner of the electrical material company.
A check for just over 200 thousand weights for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was sent by the City Hall.
With this, the amount paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical material company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the City's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "clearance of accounts for payment".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that he would make more money from the Commune in favour of this supplier, which was observed by the State's Higher Audit Office for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total amount still owed to him and, therefore, how many more cheques are missing to send to Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, it's just paying you what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of the 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last of the 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as is the case with the Act when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other Governments from using their services, the Treasury assured that they had not used their services again.
The previous, after on 25 July, Northwest published a review to the Czechs issuing the City Council to its suppliers, which revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pounds, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he charged checks for more than 3 million weights.
Emergency services to tourist sites
Tourist businessmen are complaining about the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the Gloriata Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in bad shape and that they project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have reported that the image of the destination is taken care of and reverse the evil that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come to pass and see the disorder and take him back to the nearby businesses.
"The politicians don't know what it's like to close one day a company and have no idea of the money being lost, or otherwise they won't do the works in time and without proper planning."
Hoteler José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibilities and prevent it from going through again, how to do so, giving preventive maintenance and not falling into the rectification only," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants that we deserve a clean site to live and the City must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other places that also look careless and incomplete, he said, such as the Escudo and the Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, for the tourist to come, not only depends on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has clean on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what tourist attractions are," he said.
"It has not been given due attention and this type of fact shows something that is known to everyone, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that it is urgent to rescue tourist sites in Mazatlán, because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that must be put together with the municipality and be a priority for having the city day by day, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Happyly Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to order first, clean and put us online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Request IP results at Congress
Mr Davalos, President of the CEC, proposed that the Members take on the great responsibility of being an example of a better Sinaloa for the various challenges they face.
A decent and free labour legislation of agreements between parties and the State Executive calls for the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsive Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislature, composed of seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 PAN members, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergence and one of the PVEMs, has been established.
The list of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the State is that they will come to a clean and commitment management with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanism or patriotism are not repeated.
Eduardo Davalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the recent 40 foreign Members of the Congress of the State take on the great responsibility of being an example of a better Sinaloa for the various challenges facing them.
"We hope that the Members really exercise their right, free of agreement between the parties, because it is customary that they make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnival appearances of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
He therefore said that they would certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that would lead to the Governor in turn.
"We are busy doing a decent job and above all committed to society and sectors because they were the ones who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Island Hotel Association, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives was to push and add forces to seek the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they boost economic growth, which generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will in some way promote the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he asked the new legislators to give him the weight he saw within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with a lower budget and it is inconsistent as an important economic activity and as a generator of money and investment and that it is directly responsible for the agro-industry."
In addition, it is necessary to label resources for detonating tourist projects and to assist in providing security to the state and in updating the Alcohol Act that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
Searching for a Magic King
Dolls, cars and bicycles, including toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For your parents, the next Day of Reyes will be difficult to please your illusions, as your home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a key.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they want so much.
The family lives in a humble house in the Colonia Salvador Allende and lives up to date because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Sometimes we see her hard because my husband has no leg, but we sell mandarin and papa... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayeta Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bike, while his 3-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo longed to have a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother, Jesus, Cayetana suggests cutting clothes for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I told him, 'Let's see a son', because he was very face-to-face,' recalled Cayettena with sadness.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, age 11, is size 12; Isaiah, age 10, is size 10, while 8-year-old Miguel uses size eight.
José Juan, aged 14, lacks tennis, so a couple of sizes five and a half or six would be of great help to him.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign Search for a Mago King, giving a toy or cash at the Northwest reception.
Fourteen alleged drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been carried out in the context of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
Persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where drug production was carried out.
"Approximately 750 plants in Cannabis have been seized, four kilos of hachis, money and equipment for production," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesperson for the Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women, including the two alleged network leaders, have been arrested, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear in the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face the allegations of cannabis production, possession with the aim of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have taken place after a long investigation that has lasted for about a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has enabled us to carry out the arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some seventy agents participated in this police operation of the Quebec Security Estrie Research Module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department.
It will be possible to combat clandestine migration without problems
The draft law of conservatives, which, according to the Government, should solve the problem of the patchwork of illegal migrants, will certainly face a great opposition, as the three opposition parties announced Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the Charter."
"I am here with a party that has created the granite you walk," said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after the weekly Caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow any person who is on a ship identified as a transport of illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he pointed to the wrong white.
"We are against it and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the Government is doing," said Mr. Duceppe.
NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms that indicate that its party is not strong enough with illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democratics agree that measures are being taken against those responsible for clandestine patres, and that is what we intend with another bill, C-35," said Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and incarcerates children for a minimum of one year," said Mrs. Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of playing politicians and disregarding the will of the Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs not to tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and treat the country as if it were a fake."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," said Minister Kenny.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
A conservative, however, has informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request a vote so that each MP who is going to oppose is later explained in front of his electors.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and corruption by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Research in New York is a matter since January last year.
Metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, the announcement of Tuesday has taken more than one by surprise.
It should be said that, during a permanent meeting of the Quebec Police Services Council on 29 October, this measure was never discussed in spite of Robert Dutil's presence.
That was enough for the party's criticism of Quebec that deals with the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this ad as "a rabbit pulled out of the kitchen" and as "a last-time puzzle solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," just says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr Charest insists on avoiding the creation of this commission of research, the more people share our opinion, that is, he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of research is by the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance of the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this dead spot, he suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the general spokesman to conduct an inquiry into corruption and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the general speaker," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a Commissioner, thus enabling him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent framework is not the only project in the Kerest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to be made by the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the caselaw is not explicit in this kind of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed on his part that his counterpart of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments to this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to engine groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were detained.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Act on Gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several water courses are being monitored closely because of the strong rainfalls that have been registered in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon a ground run took place in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, the houses have been evacuated.
At night, another ground run took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road went down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday at night, several regions recorded strong rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Also, an additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors located north of the river and in the valley of the Outauais were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimetres of rain.
Since these precipitations are added to the snow drought that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will land.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued alerts to the Ouereau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chene, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, the strong rainfalls have caused some lakes to land in Sainte-Julianne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the strong rains have pulled a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the landing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civilian security unit continues to be alerted and monitored, according to Annik Bouchard, the security adviser.
The Quebec Crescent Forecast Centre, for its part, issued Wednesday announcements communicating the strong growing rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assumption, the Ouereau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partly blame in Dupont
The radio provider of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback to the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) by controversial statements concerning social and Haitian assistance, as well as its gross language on the radio.
The CCNR considered that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, an improperly negative representation of Haitians and gross language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day".
The Council has also indicated that the debates on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two persons who have committed suicide, do not breach the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made in broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the Common Front of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters must communicate reliable data and not lead to deception.
In connection with suicide, the submitted Stéphane Dupont had demonstrated that suicide was an act of cobardity.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to life ' s problems.
"Most of the Committee considers that the episodes put in question by "Dupont le Midi" have dealt with a delicate subject in an equitable and appropriate manner."
In this respect, therefore, any guilt has been dropped.
The last dispute referred to the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had staged a media confrontation that had generated many reactions.
CHOI's presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help the Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needed people were really going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an improperly negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already completed my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," said the presentation.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of gross language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio chain has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the issuer, which must, inter alia, announce decisions once in the longer hours of hearing within three days.
A king of the kung fu in Montreal
The watchman of Argelino origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who highlights in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, goes up to the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I began to practice martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the game on the ground that involves mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World's amateur World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Show World Cup in China."
"They will invite the athletes who have finished between the first four positions in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I ended the tournament in fifth place, but I reached the third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is I've been making progress in every competition."
"To this step, I will be the first one this time or next year!"
The "san show" or "sand" is a discipline from China in which it is allowed to hit with the fists and feet, as well as throw the opponents to the ground.
The clashes are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous Pugilist in this kind of fight is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Zemmal Nacer should only keep a competition in his career, he will certainly go to the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is China's most famous and prestigious," explains the sympathetic boy.
"It's like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand). "
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the end.
"The one who won me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face at the end of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in unsolicited contracts
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the centre of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor, which has obtained without a prior bid the most important contract, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energie gérance, was created in 2004 following the decision of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energie management consortium obtained a profitable contract without prior public tendering.
For the Quebec Party, the use of companies' consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and raise prices.
"This is a new method of collision and elimination of competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," said Québecn party MP Sylvain Simard yesterday on a press wheel.
Earlier this morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the national Assembly because he said he did not understand how to benefit from the public interest in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, firmly denying that a conflict had occurred with this contract.
"I began to get tired," he protested, defending that the PQ had acted in a "dishonest" and "with a lack of rigour".
He said "minimum" would be that the PQ apologized.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a bid for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been awarded without competition; it has been negotiated.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the standard in Quebec, including for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the consortium formula in the technical advice sector is being investigated in the Government.
A quick view of Quebec's commercial record allows for the identification of more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the Energie management consortium, Minister Normandeau has pointed out that "the territory of Bahia James responds to a particular work dynamic and Hydro-Québec has responded specifically to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
"If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the players in the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of the people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Energie management consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advice contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Genivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Energy management.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the energy management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has made it clear that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has made it clear that the PQ is also linked to these companies, that they "finance it", before it is stated that it is more of their leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply sceptical.
The Quebec consumer only trusts sustainable development actors, as well as fair trade marks and environmental certificates to guide his elections.
According to the responsible consumption barometer, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe through which pulses messages that defend a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even inhibits its commitment.
Even if the consumption of products called "socially responsible" has increased in 2010, the Quebecans seem to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say that they do not, in fact, trust in the environmental commitment of companies or in the environmental advertising of them, reveal the measuring tool developed by the Sherbrooke University's responsible Consumer Observatory.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates bearing the products referred to as fair, as well as the credibility of products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "corresponsible", says Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecans take the speeches of politicians on this issue seriously.
In any event, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about one-third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, the gaps and the questionable nature of the information make 46% of consumers want this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecans also say that they are not confident of the alleged performance of the organic products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in its neighborhood and have preferred to buy food grown in its region, says Barometer.
More greener and responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points over a maximum of one hundred this year), the Quebec Consumer Homo loves to occupy the position of the king of the recycling that tries to reduce its environmental impact by worrying about the protection of wildlife.
According to Barometer, however, this social awareness seems to be from outside the door: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecans indicated that they used public transport or shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this wide-ranging behavioral survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and pedestrian displacements.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to make a financial commitment to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Angus and the Parallel Society, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Angus and the Parallel Development Society, which expected a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois again the eXcentris cinema complex in the storm of Saint-Laurent and return his true vocation film, did not get what they were asking for.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would, in fact, be less than the initial expectations; it could be a viable solution in favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first plan of action last spring and a request of 12.8 million, but since then applications have been reviewed at the bottom.
The president of the Society for the Development of Cultural Entrepreneurs (SODEC), François Macerola, who is the leader of the eXcentris file, submitted a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
A last report was sent to you a decade ago.
However, SODEC received a counter proposal from the office on Tuesday.
Parallels and Angus are due until 31 December to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the assumption of a State grant should be completely discarded.
We recall that the Association of Movie Hall Owners and Film Complexes in Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives in the sector claim considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of it, has carried for ten years the author's film charge in his complex premises, after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films was patented in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to be loyal to their clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, spurred a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to open the way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallel, continues to project films in eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms next February 27th, projecting the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des men et des godseux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the proposals at the bottom they have received.
The sight of Canada is raised...
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadians' complex with respect to the Americans, but at the same time reflect the feeling of superiority of the latter to Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think about Canada-United States relations when they are going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government to get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which have been made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during a full federal electoral campaign, reports to what extent the United States does not enter into the issues debated by the political leaders.
This brought great surprise to the US ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps the political leaders are conditioned by a complex of practically inferiority to Canadians when dealing with day-to-day household issues rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign), " she writes.
He concludes, therefore, that the United States is "the proficial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The ambassador has even more problems in understanding this "absorbing silence" because the two countries maintain a strong political and economic relationship.
" Logically, I think, the ability of a candidate, a party and, more importantly, the leader of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which voters should think when voting."
This sense of importance can also be observed by the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, in charge of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"His trip will help to ensure the government's survival during the vote of confidence in the beginning of February on the federal budget, through which Canada will record for the first time a deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40,000 million," wrote Mr. Breese.
There is no mention of the fact that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to prevent the coalition from being replaced, nor that opposition parties would condition their survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerted Washington about the increasingly negative image that broadcasts the dramatic series in the United States CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about Border's issue, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even to kidnappings for the CIA to realize interrogative energy.
Another cable says that during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to accommodate some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but he depended "on every case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote, "He has submitted a document to the State Secretary for Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the spirits have been warmed with the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former consultant very close to Stephen Harper, stated on the CBC radio that the responsible for this massive escape should be "destined".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee is an echo.
A Global Plan to Renewal of Lighting
Yesterday, in Cancún, the United Nations has proposed a plan for the renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in hundreds of countries to reduce greenhouse gas (GEI) to an amount that is practically equivalent to a third of the additional reduction that needs to be implemented to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is reflected in the whole of major concrete projects that the United Nations expects to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bombs, which still monopolies between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluo-compact bombs or, better still, electroluminescent diodes (DEL or LED) bombs, much of the 1,800 million tons (Gt) of GI emitted on the planet would be avoided to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of emissions from the planetary motor park.
In Copenhagen, last year, large countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce GHG global emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, a further 5 Gt of this amount should be reduced to stabilize, before 2020, the rise in temperatures in two centigrades to prevent it from being uncontrollable.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is released in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluo-compact pumps, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED pumps, energy consumption is reduced twice more.
Fluocompact pumps last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bombs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bomb, which allows us to make an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in one hundred countries.
These new bombs can also work with resustants and emit very little heat.
Above all, they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations regarding fluo-compact pumps, since they contain mercury and should be eliminated as hazardous wastes, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluo-compact pumps, but the coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that melts with incandescent bombs.
Only in the United States, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the benefits of this international programme to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save billions of dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, i.e. the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2,500 million.
Costa de Marfil looks forward to the announcement of election results
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, since the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," said a UN chief spokesman.
"Ask all sides of Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the deadline for Wednesday to midnight without the results being published, three days since Sunday's election.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the ICE president had commented on the television that the commission "continued working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday the world has multiplied the requests that the CEI finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the rising Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo band has been in favour of the abolition by the Constitutional Council of the "fraud" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the fall of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the President of Côte d'Ivoire, said that the intimidation maneuvers of the UN voters in the north of the country had deterred the followers of the outgoing president to vote.
All elections could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who dissociates any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His allies claimed that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew that he had lost and that he had filed a complaint before the Constitutional Council after he had prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results.
The second round of the presidency, on Sunday, should have led to the process of reconciling and reconciling a country divided into two years ago.
The United Nations warned Wednesday that the policy class of Côte d'Ivoire could be considered responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the votes in front of 32% of Alaskan Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent in continental territory (9.7 per cent taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected by the provisional variations (CVE) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of stops remains at 2,631,000 in continental France.
Data in the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the population active in continental territory and 9.7% with DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, are or are not available in the two weeks to work and seek or not to work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a new increase in the unemployment rate up to 24.2% in continental France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the sense of ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older persons, up to 6.4% in continental France (+0.2 points in three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, a figure of 6.6% with DOMs.
Only a stable unemployment rate between 25 and 49 years of age has been recorded, with 8.3% in continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Since 2006, Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate, after a debate on its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union Statistics Agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, director of waste treatment companies and the President-in-Office of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for the abuse of social property, abuse of funds and public property, coverage, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, according to his counsel.
"Alexandre Guerini will fight and answer all the questions the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to track you through a lot of reprehensible acts, something else is to prove them," he had told AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client's presence.
Mr. Guerini, the head of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, has wanted to transmit a document to the judge through his lawyers before his presence.
On Wednesday night they began to investigate and also imprisoned one of their close friends, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to your lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing your client has done has been to take care of the vegetables you need to manage.
As to the assignment of contracts or the destination of the funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about them, as legal person Simon said.
In the context of this file, it is also being investigated since Wednesday, Daniel Pinna, former director-general of Aubagne's urban agglomeration services, because of the abuse of funds and complicity, but has left him in parole and has prohibited him from meeting with the actors in the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The Master Master has taken into account the explanations and released them," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Wednesday night, four other people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as stated by the deputy prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of the property of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), has been charged with "trafficking of passive influences and corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Briguier agglomeration have been questioned by "suspension and abuse of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and "complexity in the abuse of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated by "covering the abuse of social property".
Among those who have faced Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
The researchers suspect that their companies are serving to whiten out the capital of the great bandidism.
The investigation is being carried out in the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source near the research points out that the research focuses particularly on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the waste of Aubagne, as well as other cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Issue Clotilde Reiss: Eliseo has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, Clotilde Reiss's fate, the young French researcher arrested in Iran by "spionage", has been in the village of the public in France, has warned diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the eye of the U.S. diplomats.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Eliseo has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own "rehens" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought for US justice by trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram drawn up on 12 August 2009 in Paris reads the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage takeover cases".
Eliseo's advisor for strategic issues, François Richier, accompanied by the director of Quai d'Orsay to the North of Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talk to U.S. diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens held to the force in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "continually resolve" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocentness", "immediate release".
Everything to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often."
Because once the attempts to negotiate by discreet channels have been exhausted, "the silence will not solve anything", Iranians are "experts in dilatarian maneuvers".
Mr Richier added that the detention of foreigners is "a common Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, on the day he will be taken to France's embassy) "will require the payment to Iranians of a large amount of money" (EUR 230,000 reward).
Moreover, he points out that Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
Iranians could "in the near future stop each other from about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after twelve days, but is locked up in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge ' s decision.
The US embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iran's nuclear material acquisition networks, Majid Khakavand's expulsion is a bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Release Iranian instead of French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier made sure it wasn't.
Eliseo says that not only "it has been greatly surprised by the judge's decision," he has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot cancel the decision", he comments.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is still under the "external" surveillance of French information services.
The advisor of Eliseo marks a telephone number, knocks it off and then informs the U.S. diplomat that Iran "is currently in a Paris building managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Eliseo does not spare himself in efforts, he uses communications and "flights" organized in the media to make Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad believe that he plays an "important" and "influence" role of "mediator".
The Americans observed this activity with certain irony and verified that manipulation brings its fruits, as several press articles transmitted the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the "blitz" media of French officials".
What is due to such "gratitude" to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris is being asked.
"Despite their full statements of praise, French officials recognize in private that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led Elisha to stand up to this fiction.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria", he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, had just been pre-empted and unresolved".
By "exacting the Syrian role", Paris is trying to "show Syria the praise that it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The objective is also to "sow the seed of the dispute between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. embassy knows it from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier trusted him: "Of course, we don't know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, if we're grateful."
"At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in Eliseo.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria who have played a "active paper for the release of our compatriot".
From midnight, young Koreans cannot play online
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called "Cenicienta" that will prevent adolescents from participating in online games after midnight blocking their access, as government officials have indicated.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, as representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family have indicated.
"Many children play all night and then it's hard for them to study at school and live a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, Minister of the Bill.
Online games will again be available at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, precisely.
The government is also asking companies to limit the time of day-to-day access to these games when the parents of young people so request, the responsible added.
In addition, it will make available to anyone who requests free computer programs to limit Internet connection time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on several facts linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the indisputable champion of world games competitions online.
In November, South Korea received four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World 2018-2022: FIFA appoints host countries
In the midst of the storm caused by the suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints Thursday to the world Cup host countries of 2018 and 2022, a clear political choice where the struggles of influence and lobbying can become primary on technical criteria.
One thing is clear: the 2018 FIFA competition edition will be held in Europe, a traditional foundation of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The edition of 2022 will be much more exotic, as the International Federation expects to acquire new territories (Qatar, Australia), after an alien on the African continent in 2010, or continue its deployment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of the Belgian and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) certifyes the economic and political interests that are at stake in a world.
Transactions between contractors, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Furthermore, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Hispanic and US nominations (2018) and the US (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of their country, with one of the football players, who only welcomed the World once, in 1966.
The BBC added wood to the house on Monday by disseminating a documentary that has shown three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to displease FIFA and shame the English leaders, who have been thrown into intense lobbying in the last few weeks with David Cameron's head.
The Chief of Government expects to re-edit the strike successfully given by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of the JJ.O.O. 2012 in 2005 for London.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to restore England's shine to the EC?
It is not clear, since the two of Spain-Portugal also has numerous strengths thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (Mundial del 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the dark economic and financial perspectives of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solubility of Spain and Portugal are all they can do to give points to Russia, which is converted into a weightier, despite the gaps in its candidacy (stations, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced a "disloyal competence in the preparation of the vote", in a direct statement to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"They're pulling off their dirty traps, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which had experience in 1994, seemed to be the most logical favorites.
The first global economic power and headquarters of the main FIFA sponsors, the country seems to benefit Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk is the granting of the World 2026 to China, which is eagerly desired by the FIFA, which would cause Asia to lose its chances for 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue with its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than you are sure of.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be affected by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
De Gaulle really had doubts.
Mitterrand had given me the impression that he was in doubt.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt whatsoever.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is still less.
One warrant in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be re-sponsored in 2012.
However, evidence of this does not combine well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential role.
Therefore, we must always appear to be suspicious.
On one side and on the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not reject a third mandate.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that you are dealing with UMP Members, Tuesday night in Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has led to a certain revision.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The President only indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited the number of five-year term of office to two.
He just broadcasted the facts, not an ad.
It's not the first time he talks about the presidents, with a funny tone, in meetings of this kind.
"In the worst case, or better, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I'm going to wonder what's next."
His statements in advance no longer draw him closer to the candidacy, nor less.
Summarize comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has gone up to the lecture that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to sincerity.
Rather, the fact that its candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many people in the PS to claim that the battle is being organised before it is planned.
On the other hand, the bad probes.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% compared to 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the subject at the UMP," the Prime Minister has reacted immediately and cautiously.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppe, renouncing the evidence.
Euro: The ECB is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of letters from the State
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the way out of the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations which should end at the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt Institute of Emissions cannot without a doubt be allowed to be so perennial if it does not want to risk exacerbating a more complicated situation in European bonds markets today.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, supported the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis of European States.
He did not mean whether he considered that the central bank should do more, e.g. by increasing its State bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."
The evening, in Brussels, during its hearing before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear more eloquent as regards his intentions, only indicating that the State letter purchase programme in the secondary market was "continuing" and that "we will see what we have decided" during the Thursday's meeting.
The only thing that remains clear is that the ECB will maintain its main non-variable type in 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of the Treasury's obligations by the ECB has doubled over the past week to around EUR 1,350 million.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday would have purchased Irish and Portuguese titles again.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have acquired securities of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that they will follow purchases at least (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes in direction.
Although lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, it still carries out unlimited liquidity allocations on favourable terms and with a duration ranging from one week to three months.
Economists hope that today this device will be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that I'm going to significantly modify your program."
"If not, it would run the risk of creating new short-term tensions," says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that a progressive output will occur during the first quarter of 2011", anticipated by Norbert Bräms, an economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
Regarding public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations for the market to remain stable," Norbert Brams added.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in performance from being paid by the most fragile States," he said yesterday.
Because if the types of interest are set by the clouds, States will have even more problems to reduce or even stabilize their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi takes over the time
After Italy had begun the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the 10-year replication of the rates of obligations.
A recovery of the precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, regional presidents have said that they heard Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation of "undecipherable" and that a "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements subsequently ignored by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday, the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the recorded figure of 210 basic points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of failure (CRQ) had been fired up to 263 points, causing a certain revision in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German types was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" by "the disturbances in the markets" and a possible contamination from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its funding needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have provided a cold water jar for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget under review in the Senate is based on 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (in front of 3.9% foreseen by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
That is why the voice that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the festivals, for a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures should be taken," said Olli Rehn, Economic Affairs Commissioner.
For the time being, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of your economy are in order and your accounts are in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate, short-term or long-term problem, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested by Italy are lower than those required by other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated by the end of March.
In such a case, there would be little time for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press call in Paris: "I think we have already demonstrated Sunday, night and day, that Europeans are clearly solidarity, determined, committed to the defence of their currency and their monetary area."
Although it was relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday in the types of obligations of European States has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a principle of normalization.
Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent white in the current speculations.
"As in May, there really is no political clarity and transparency, which significantly weighs on banking systems," Economists of Exane BNP Paribas say.
Especially because "political pace is much slower than market pace".
Conscious of this hiatus and of the dangers it poses, the European countries are intensifying the debate to strengthen the mechanisms for getting out of the already existing crisis.
Informal consultations between Finance Ministers, which are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts, are on the right track.
And this is also taking into account Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market-collimator (see above).
With regard to the European Fund for Financial Stability (EFFE), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, launched a trip to Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to collect funds, it is certainly to prepare the land.
The first EDF securities issues are expected to be realized next month.
Yesterday, a US official representative has entrusted the Reuters agency with the United States' support for a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional IMF direct commitment.
With regard to first-line countries, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms add to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path to which Greece and Ireland followed.
Both want to avoid all costs of requesting international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they consider necessary to increase confidence in a sustainable way.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds are looking at options available to speed up the process of standardising public bonds markets.
On 24 November, in Paris, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 75 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not doubt getting the wallet back.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a first-line actor in the European public debt market, believe that an additional EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
There is an instrument for this: the European financial stabilization mechanism, which currently has EUR 6 billion.
An advice that could no doubt examine the European capitals in detail.
The market conditions are particularly worse.
Snow and ice cream: 24 departments and orange alerts
The snowflakes continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are in orange alert because of the risk of snowflakes and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have joined the twenty departments that were already in orange alert, 18 from Wednesday to midnight and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Meteo France, the strong snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although they also snow slightly on the island of France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm, which are between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those in the regions of Lower Normandy, the island of France and Lemosín.
The snowflakes are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, Meteo France warns.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lanion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes, has been prohibited.
According to the gendarmies, traffic in the secondary network of Britain is complicated, so they recommend not to drive unless necessary and certain TER vehicles have been prohibited during the day.
During Thursday, school transportation in Picardia has been banned.
No specific measure was envisaged on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture " urges all drivers to drive with the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy on Thursday and 10% in Orly due to the planned snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers be contacted with their airline.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro del Grand Paris: First Financial Drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in the island of France has reached its peak, it has reached a number of thousands of millions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the metro of Grand Paris to build the Société du Grand Paris.
To initiate this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of EUR 4 billion.
On the theoretical level, this will be the sum that will later allow the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Correctional Finance Act, considered by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the means to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase of office tax on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exist "to modernise it, increase its product and target this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows?
No figures are included in the text.
But it's far from 4,000 million.
"It is necessary that tax resources be added to the EUR 4 billion of the allocation of funds that will mobilize the State and that they will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we can read in the statement of reasons.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
"From the time the income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as we explained."
"It shall be recorded in the budget and used in accordance with the requirements."
The GSP estimates that it will start to receive the 4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This instrument, in which the promised 4 billion are not included in the credit, may lead to a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Avengering Hackers and Diligent Spies
The WikiLeaks issue has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems to scandal it in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound international changes and foresees a future dominated by the regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm the fact that each file created by a secret service (independent of the nation to which it belongs) is made exclusively by press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written in any newspaper for months (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and the Siniestratly ridiculous profile of Khadafi has long given ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be formed by news of public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every work repeats (about the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what was written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism not only trust what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is Dan Brown's mechanism of success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is pessimistic, just as he is pessimistic (or anxiously) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I know, editor of the Liberian) who only considers what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the US Embassy from Rome to the Department of State was the same as the newsweek published last week.
Why, then, have the revelations of these records caused such a review?
On the one hand, they only say what every person who is cultivated already knows, i.e. that embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of State may call on the phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have been turned into spy centres.
Any viewer who sees research films knows it perfectly, we only appear that we do not know it because of hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the secrets of the world's most powerful country significantly affects the prestige of the Department of State.
Therefore, the scandal affects victims as well as the "virgins".
But we enter into the true nature of what has happened.
In ancient times, in the time of Orwell, it could be conceived as a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, by controlling each movement thanks to the phone, each transaction performed, a visited hotel, a taken highway, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eyes of power.
But when it turns out, as it happens now, that even the encryptions of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least hacker, elected as the revenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove it all.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury caused by such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to place any reserved information on the network, as it would be like publishing it on a billboard.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, confidential phone conversations cannot be expected.
Nothing turns out to be easier than to find out if and when a Head of State has moved on a plane and has contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly that, for the time being, my prediction is something of science fiction and, therefore, novelty, but I imagine government agents who are discreetly moving in diligions with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, like much, hiding some data written in the pockets of their shoes.
This information is then kept in a single copy in locked boxes with key: at the end of the accounts, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing like a cone, i.e., back.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has created a telegraph with cables (telephones).
Video tapes (analogues) had allowed film researchers to study a film step-by-step, moving forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of the installation, while now the CDs (digitals) only allow to advance or backward from chapter to chapter, i.e., to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane, with the displacements that it carries, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing but normal that communication policy and techniques bring us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In ancient times, the press was trying to understand what was being done in secret in the embassy.
At present, they are the embassies who ask for confidential information to the press.
Climate: French hats in their financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the fast-locked (fast-start or early) financing promises made by the developed countries have been respected.
And the French hats have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $3 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed itself to delivering EUR 7.200 million in three years and EUR 1.260 million in France (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has placed its best letters on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press wheel, a large complementary event, the distribution of leaflets...
The transparency operation was a valuable result and was appreciated for what it really is: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2,200 million in 2010, which sets it in the right direction towards meeting its commitment of EUR 7,200 million in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each one chooses the most appropriate reference.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years in terms of fast-start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with regard to the year or level of official development aid.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous years or to the total level of official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), while it seeks to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds.
Another crucial element, the division between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no norm and each one chooses the calculation method.
Some, like France, consider that each euro lent is equivalent to a given euro.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be justified for certain profitable investments (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is possible to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... As much as, for its commitments, only the cost of the loan should be calculated for the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent to a kind of interest).
But France does not find such reasoning useful: "respects" its 420 million-euro commitment by making a 91.5% loan (389.8 million) and a 8.5% grant (36.1 million euros); consult the EU document to see it from its own eyes.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so often.
Germany uses it in 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among other things, respect their commitments with a 100% donation.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes a euro to meet its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort comparable.
A good trick!
In summary, in its fast-start financing, France commits double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions in time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
With only EUR 36.1 million spent, it is possible to give the impression that it spends 420 million "new and additional" as promised.
The handling of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has been involved in arbitration) could have a double negative impact both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give when they can just lend?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not stupid...
The chapter of early funding is a short-term reduction in the overall climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra sand grains in the immense machinery that is the CNUCC.
Let's hope it's not like that.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its method of calculation for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and the same as the remaining countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could make it possible to move forward the debate on gambling bets on long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore hope that the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Koscisko-Morizet, will arrive at Cancún next week.
A surprising announcement on France's fast start and its vision of "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the negotiations.
Warning on child-inflicted pesticides
A 10-year-old child enters a day of 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Generations Futures Association (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "does not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with", acquired in Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and September the foods that are usually consumed by a child of about ten years in four meals and a tenttime per day.
These foods taken as a model, which respect official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as golosins, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable cancers and five substances classified as safe cancers, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to the studies of various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic pollutants and/or PE is worrying," the association said.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible cancer residues and three considered safe cancers, as well as about one-twenty of residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a tentepié for the college, contains traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to green Jews in Kenya, including in food, where the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian thread, the latrine, and even the bread bar or the chip were attached to pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analysis found the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon wheel was the most "nutrient" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk generated by these "contaminants cocktails" for the consumer "probably underestimates", says the study.
The Alliance of Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed that a moratorium on the use of pesticides should be applied to "the increase of diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
