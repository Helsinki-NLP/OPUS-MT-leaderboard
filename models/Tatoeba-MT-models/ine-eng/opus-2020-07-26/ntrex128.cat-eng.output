Members of the Gallies Assembly concerned to "identify them as Muppets"
Several members of the assembly expressed their condolences to the proposal to amend their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Gallès Parliament).
This debate arose as a result of the plan to change the name of the Assembly by the Galician Parliament.
The members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure can become a cause for mockery.
A member of the Labour Party's assembly said his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "resides with Twp or Pwp".
For non-galley readers: In gall, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party's assembly commented that his party's "do not see it with good eyes" and proposed various alternatives.
For his part, a Gallese conservative member said that his group was "open" in front of the name change, but he also commented that there was too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Gallese is spoken in a similar way to the letter "u" in Yorkshire.
According to the assembly committee responsible for drafting the legal draft to introduce the changes in names: "The final decision on any qualification to appoint members of the assembly will of course be made in the members themselves".
The Law of 2017 of the Government of Wales gives the Assembly of Wales all the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly by the Galáles Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee was called upon by "Members of the Gallés Parliament" or "WPM", the MWP option was the one that received a wider support in public consultation.
It seems that the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives, but the attempt to reach a consensus can be a curse to the President of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in the matter of weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the assembly will vote definitively on their name during the debate on legislation.
Macedonians will vote in referendum to change their country's name
Citizens will choose Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name for the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular consultation took place in an attempt to resolve a dispute that lasted decades with the neighboring country of Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has insisted for a long time on the fact that the name of its North neighbour represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed the efforts of that country to form part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, against the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those who are in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stop sounding: the difficulties of the Harlem churches
"Historically, the big people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's none left, of the two."
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
"People have another way of socializing today," he says.
"The bars have stopped being that kind of living room for the neighborhood where people used to go on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of shares does not last as long as his leaders predict "and that sooner or later they return to the place where they went out."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with people who will not be of any help to the temples in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be of a white race," he says, "and so what they do will accelerate the closing of all churches, since it is quite unlikely that the majority of people who move to these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the church of Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that originally existed in the year 30 C.E. left.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to minority traders in 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's happy men made plans to rebuild it, it was then when they commissioned the carriage.
Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and successor to the church of St. Martin's, proudly described the carriage as "the campaigns of poor people."
The expert who made the roll sound July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the first carriage of the world that was played by a black race musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who had to move to the largest carriage of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What St. Martin's has sounded during the last few months, on the contrary, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, formed by lay leaders, wrote in the diocese last July while expressing its concern that the diocese "was intended to transmit costs" to the council, although this latter was not involved in the contraction of the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some happy people have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A bull injured a 13-year-old boy while looking for bats in California
A bull attacked and wounded a 13-year-old child on Saturday while he was invading to find hostages in California on the first day of the camp season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on the KSWB-TV in San Diego, he spent half an hour traveling with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of a boy asking for help, and then they met with a group up to where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was the joy of having taken a bite, but then he realized that he was calling 'I'm biting!
I've been bitten!'
He had all the broken clavicle," observed Hammel when he got to the boy.
"Because everyone gets out of the water, I called out, 'There's a bull in the water!' says Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where he was entered in a serious state.
You don't know what kind of bull is responsible for the attack.
On a press wheel, assistant Larry Giles commented that a few weeks worked that a bull had been detected in the area, but that it was decided that this species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the tower.
The authorities closed their access to the beaches from Ponto Beach to Casablanca to Swami's to Ecinitas for 48 hours because of research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of bull in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's, to the UK's market for beauty products
Sainsbury's decided to compete in Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with beauty product passes in the style of the big warehouses occupied with specialized employees.
These large passages are just part of a considerable investment in the UK's beauty products market, a market that moves around GBP 2800 million and continues to grow while the fashion and household products sectors remain behind, and 11 stores across the country will be tried to expand to more shops in the year that comes if the test is successful.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space in their facilities that were formerly intended for TVs, microns and household products.
Sainsbury's claims that it will duplicate its beauty offer to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with areas of similar brands that can be found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its range of boutique makeup products so that most of the products are now suitable for vegan, an increasingly demanding aspect for younger consumers.
The Minorist Chain The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open concessions to two Sainsbury's stores. The first one did so last week in Croydon, South London, while the second one will open to Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying on the Internet and changing the habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has made big supermarkets need to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, shops will increasingly resemble large warehouses in an attempt by supermarkets to fight off Aldi and Lidl supermarkets with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos' sales points to many of its supermarkets, besides a number of Habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, he comments, has served to relaunch the purchases and increase the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its departments of beauty products and pharmaceuticals resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury did a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended up all too soon to agree on how to divide the benefits of the pharmaceutical chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy arrives three years after the sale by Sainsbury's of its business of 281 pharmacies in Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have an important paper on the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands for skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have transformed the look of our fashionable products to improve the face-to-face environment for our customers.
We've invested in worker formats specifically that will be of great help in offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and the practical location make us one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way to understand."
Peter Jones "frustrated" after Holly Willoughby is behind a 11-million GBP deal.
The Dragons' Den Peter Jones star went off "furry" after the Holly Willoughby TV presenter went after an 11 million GBP deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to engage in a joint home and Truly accessories business.
The business of these two media characters had come to compare with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This 37 - year - old presenter used Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' Star in Peter Jones angry at withdrawing in the last minute of his profitable life-style joint business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furry" when the star's red television admitted, during a tense meeting held in the center of his empire on Tuesday in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new agreements of the presenter, worth GBP 1.5 million, implied that he would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of home products and accessories True.
The business had come to compare with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was looking forward to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at GBP 11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane toward one of his holiday homes outside the United Kingdom.
According to one source, "Truly was far from Holly's main priority.
He was destined to be his long - term future, where we would see him for the next twenty - thirty years.
His decision to go back left all the parts involved without a word.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of merchandise in its center of Marlow ready to be sold."
According to experts, this morning's presenter's departure, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions to the company because of the important investment that had been made in products, from kitchens and lamps to household clothes, and the possibility of delays in its release.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin had kept a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined him in the office of president last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together. In addition, Jones has 40 percent of the participation in the Baldwin TV producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity ITV program.
A source near Jones said last night, "We won't make any comments about his business."
Hard charges... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticisms he received by the media to make a comment that some would consider "unlike a president" and to have such a positive opinion from the North Korean leader.
Why did he give up Trump so much?
Trump said, while making a noise noise noise from a news reporter:
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first June in Singapore was declared a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization are blocked.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong commented on this on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "response" by the US at the first disarmament initiatives made by its country.
He noted, however, that the US continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump's point of view, in contrast, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare war in North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we keep this great relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have had positive results: ending tests with missiles, helping to free hostages, and returning home to the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his little habitual focus on the relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be Presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowd full of people, we'd have about 200," Trump said, pointing out the crowd that was in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds dead because of a tsunami and a earthquake in Indonesia
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was said to non-governmental organizations in other countries that were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, which was required in advance to catalyze international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so that the situation is highly demanding," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children are organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not even certain that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disasters Agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies were allowed to contribute at the time of offering assistance.
Given the constant earthquake in Indonesia, the country is unfortunately not prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although Aceh has been built in the case of tsunamis, they are not frequent at other costs.
The apparent lack of alert sirens in Palu in the case of tsunamis, although there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge amount of Indonesian islands is, in the best case, a whole challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was caught in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is now heading to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to arrive at the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had, as the central element of his election campaign, improved Indonesia's poor infrastructure, and invested huge amounts of money in roads and railway routes.
However, Joko's government faces the year it comes to re-election of funding deficits.
Joko also faces the pressure of the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where most Muslims have adopted a more conservative fall faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced persons are the result of the fights that take place in the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs with hammers, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes the goal of the fourth with a far-off jut in front of Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the First League in front of Chelsea with his goal marked at a minute 89 Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's gate when his team was losing 1 to 0.
The pilot was accommodated to the left before leaving an incredible court headed for the second suit.
The shot crossed the whole area with a big lift as it moved to the right cross of the gate.
The pilot finally started down over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full jump to try to stop her and ended up at the bottom of the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible," says Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanté coming, I made a touch, and I didn't think much of it, I just dedicated myself to playing."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 in a break after marking a goal in 25 minutes through her Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the game, the Blue team's front cut back a pass to Mateo Kovacic before starting from almost the middle of the field and sprinting into the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle of the field.
Next, he made a magnificent passage deep, leaving Hazard in the area with the controlled pilot.
Hazard overcome the defense to finish the second suit with a jute with the left bed where the porter of Liverpool Alison Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Naples at the team stage of the League of Champions next Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for her part, will play with Videoton at UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths for Indonesia's tsunami in 832
The number of deaths as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped between the ruins of the ruined buildings due to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters, according to the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press ring.
The city of Palu, more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after finding a woman stabbed
Murder investigation started after the woman's body was found this morning at Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with several punches at Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
The police have asked the people in the area who have seen or heard anything about the crime that is being presented to the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan, "If the investigation is still at a preliminary stage, I'd like to make a call to anyone who was near John Street at Birkenhead and who had seen or felt anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to make a call to any person, especially to the cab drivers who could have picked up anything through the car-board camera, who could be contacted, as they could have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman they found was Birkenhead's body and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
While the investigation continues, the police have commented that they are reporting the facts to the relatives closest to the victim.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police have told him that no one has allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he ran out of words.
He's warning residents that it'll take hours to get back in.
He could feel like a police officer telling a man that the whole area is treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
Don't stop saying, "It's terrible!"
At 14:00, two police trucks were in the agreed area with another van parked outside.
A number of officers remained within the agreed area controlling the floor block.
Anyone is asked to have information to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by 0800 555 111 and mention the 247 issue of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of the British parliament became the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewriting history"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the most pure-style destruction of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects in England that were carried out by their fanatic followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and an "intent of rewriting the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate about the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of the Westminster Palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe he'd end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for his predecessor's actions that he did during the last century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the 19th century's opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still believe is worthy of being commemorated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century, not now, as a defender of parliament in front of external pressure, in his case obviously of the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation or not is a theme of historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th-century media conflict was the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a banner of this division.
His adjournments as Lord Protector are also worthy to be celebrated and commemorated."
A killer pig kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and all covered with blood near a pig market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported on Sunday China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs' vaccines into a farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As far as you know, I've been traveling on Wednesdays with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him a piece of pork.
According to him, there was a big male pig in the court with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-pound pulley had injured the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had broken legs and blood-stained," said the cousin, of the surname "Wu," as he spoke of the news of the evening of Guiyang.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 in the morning of Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned either by Yuan or by his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the news of the evening that the pig was kept closed and isolated to avoid attacking anyone else, while the police gathered the evidence at the crime scene.
According to information, the Yuan family and market leaders are negotiating a compensation for their death.
Although very rare, there have been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig of almost 300 kg took a galley farmer against his tractor until his wife could scare the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "defective".
"They like to play.
They're like kids, they have a lot of curiosity... they don't have the idea of doing anything wrong.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve," he said.
The remnants of the Rosa hurricane will bring torrential rains all over the southwest of the United States
According to the prognostics, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves on the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States during the next few days.
The Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, owned by a Category 1 hurricane at 5:00 in the morning of Sunday, hours east of the United States, and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it is beginning to form a depression in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving towards the western coast of the United States. When Rosa is approaching the peninsula of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm, she will start to leave a strong tropical humidity in the north to the south-west of the United States.
The Rosa will leave Mondays up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Afterwards, tropical humidity will interact with the depression that is approaching to generate torrential rains widespread throughout the south-west during the next few days.
At various points, between 25 and 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous streams, waste streams and the possibility of land slavery in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause a precipitation index of about 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected from 50 to 100 mm of rain in parts of the south-west, especially in much of Arizona.
There is the possibility of laughing, since the situation is getting worse very quickly because of the dispersal of tropical rains.
It is totally discouraged to enter the desert on foot in front of the tropical rain threat.
Torrent rains could cause gorges to become uncontrollable rivers. In addition, storms can bring windmills and dust clouds to concrete points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains at certain points on the southern coast of California.
It is possible to record total precipitations over 50 mm, which could cause flow of minor wastes and relieving paths.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
They're going to start arriving at tropical rain-sucking waves in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread to the region of the Four Cantons on Tuesday and will continue throughout the Wednesdays.
October there will be several important temperature oscillations for all Americans as the Arctic cooled down, although the tropicals will remain very warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic changes in temperature at a short distance.
The U.S. Central Region on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa have been recorded.
During the next few days, the persistent heat of summer will try to expand again.
It is expected that the month of October will start with heat in much of the central and eastern US area, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the south-east Plans area to the far north-east.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, representing about 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities that temperatures are recorded above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw on Thursday the growing witness of the candidate to a member of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
In the meantime, the political impasse continued, with the broadcasters interrupting the usual Friday programming due to a turn of events in the last minute: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a charge investigation for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate committee on judicial matters that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a school party.
Kavanaugh, in a exalted witness, claimed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million spectators have seen this witness on Friday.
The company had the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The audience figures were not immediately available for other chains that transmitted the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems with calculating the people he sees from his office.
From perspective, it's a hearing similar to that of an American football party or Oscar's ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the opinion leaders who have clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most audienceed chain, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during one day's testimony, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second to 3.26 million spectators.
CBS reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's data.
The interest remains high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate republican issued a communiqué saying they would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while he was instigated by demonstrators when he was trying to climb a lift to go to a judicial committee's view.
Flake stayed several minutes with the sighted while he was live on TV at CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
They told him 'you have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!'
Flake said his office had issued a communiqué and, before the elevator doors were closed, said he would have more to say in the committee's view.
Within a few hours, all cable and broadcasting chains were already streaming directly to the time when the Judicial Committee had to vote whether or not to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate to submit it to the vote.
Flake said, in exchange, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the appointment of the next week, a condition required by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake had influence, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to abandon the European Union to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and to undermine national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In a further interview with May on the cover of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, which states that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU collect taxes together is "of all absurdity".
The murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU team player
The police arrested a suspect for shooting off Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was campaigning on the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, has been arrested and sent to a second-degree murder charge, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, according to the WAFB's branch.
After asking Simpson, he admitted that Wade had died of a gunshot, according to the police.
His trust is set at $350 000, according to the lawyer.
The Forensic Office of the East Baton Rouge District issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the direction of the neck.
The department is grateful for the operating group of fugitives from the state police in Louisiana, the state police crime lab, the South University police and the community's citizens for the research that has culminated in this detention.
The sports director of the LSU Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the forces of the order of the area for his "diligence and seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
At a distance of 1,988 m, he played the ball and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 turns to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach commented that the team was "distorted" and that Wade's death was "a very strong time."
"Things like this are the things that make you suffer at all times," said Wade.
A Spouse's Volcano in Mexico City
The ashes dug by Volcano Popocatepetl have reached the outskirts of the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after they detected activity on the crater and registered 183 gas and ashes within 24 hours.
The center was overseeing several strepts and tremors that had occurred recently.
Images on social networks where a fine layer of ashes is appreciated in the car parabrises in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Joachimilco.
Geophysics have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano 72 km south-east of the capital since a magnitude earthquake of 7.1 shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists shortly before the referendum on independence
Six people were detained in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favour of independence confronted the anti-attack police and thousands of people joined counter-arrival protests to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on its secession.
A group of independent individuals detained by the anti-avallot police began to throw eggs and paint them in dust, which caused the appearance of dark dust clouds in the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later that same day, he was beaten by the police, who used his fists to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups sang "Don't forget, don't forgive" face-to-face with Unionist protesters who called "Long Life in Spain."
Fourteen people had to be exposed to mild wounds during protests, depending on local sources.
The tensions have not diminished in this region of independent mentality a year after October 1st was held a referendum considered illegal by Madrid but also due to the Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence for a vast majority, although the participation index was low, as the opposition to the section boycotted the vote mostly.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote entering electoral colleges throughout the region, causing violent confrontations.
Independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support to the national police.
The demonstration also took place, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independent demonstration together with his wife, said that he had little hope of the possibilities that Catalonia would experience independence.
"Last year we lived one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for being able to vote, but now we're stuck," she said.
Despite gaining a vital victory, although in a short time, in the autonomous elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have suffered to maintain the momentum this year, as many of their leading leaders are in an auto-imposed or detained exile awaiting trial on their paper in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the police support demonstration with her phone, and says the conflict has been triggered by the politicians of both sides.
"Tension only increases," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the retreat in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after investing a house with a car
Three 33, 34, and 39-year-old men have been arrested after a car repeatedly investing a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage was caused to the doors and to the same building.
It's also possible, at some point, someone shot a bullet at the car.
A Menga game gives the Livingston win for 1 to 0 in front of Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston assumed victory
The Livingstone, which this year had gone up by category, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which everything is the second defeat of Steven Gerrard in 18 games as a coach of the Ibrox district club.
Dolly Menga's game marked the difference, because with this victory, Gary Holt's team is in second position, which shares with the Hibernate.
Gerrard's men, on the other hand, continue without winning out of the Premiership this season, and next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they will be separated by eight points.
But before that, the Rangers receive this Thursday the Vienna Rapid in Europe League.
Livingston, meanwhile, expands up to six parties his inviting rat to the league, with a Holt as a coach who still doesn't know what the defeat is since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of the visitors' direct game
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the marker long before the goal, as its direct game caused all kinds of problems in the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way between the defense, but he abused his chance when he found himself in front of the gate. Then, Alan Lithgow sent the pilot out trying to try to finish Craig Halkett's head, which crossed the gate.
The locals were good enough to let Rangers come to their area, as they knew they could put the visitors in trouble in isolated games.
And that's how this decisive goal came to be.
The orbit sparked a lack of interest in Rangers and Livingston opened up to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could touch it first and finish it from the central part of the area.
Until then, Rangers had dominated possession, but he met with an impenetrable defense and a porter Liam Kelly who had very little work during the party,
The scene repeated on the other side, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a farewell stop.
For his part, Rangers Allan McGregor's porter stopped with his feet one occasion by Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up diverting another liveston combination game.
Rangers dedicated themselves to hanging once and another pilot in the Livingston area, just to be rejected, and two penalties were claimed, one for a alleged Halket's entry to the Glenn Middleton replacement, and one for the hands, both of which were dismissed.
Livingstone "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingstone.
A man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to surpass all expectations in this ascending path.
His game style and staff have hardly changed since his return to the highest category, although much of the credit must be attributed to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, at the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be dependent on Menga throughout the party.
Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments shown by Gerrard as a coach, they definitely didn't know how to keep the level.
They didn't know how to create occasions (only once they clearly exceeded the local defense), and this Rangers, who is in the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Aggressive reception for Erdogan in Colonia
They were all smiling and clear on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders from Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversy of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, which was intended to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan, then moved to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
And it's that this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police set up security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers joined around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also felt as they condemned Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to welcome the country.
Both manifestations reflect the division of opinions around the visitor, considered a hero for some German Turks and titled dictator for others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies meeting a car
A cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the street corner of the Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 a.m.
The vehicle driver stopped and, although the paramedics took care of the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist dies in a case of an escape crash at Childers Street, 1.6 km from the site of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said their agents are working to identify the man and inform the relatives of the facts.
The street has been cut off and deviations for bus routes have been applied. In addition, drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six agents injured in an altercat
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation in this high-security men's prison, according to the centre's office.
The facts occurred in Long Lartin's prison, Worcestershire, at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and still persist.
Specialized "retired" agents moved to the scene to put an end to the altercation, where eight prisoners were involved. The appellate could be contained by a band.
The officers had to be alert for slight injuries to the face instead of the facts.
According to a prison spokesman, "We have deployed specially trained prison personnel to try to solve an incident that took place in Long Martin's prison, which still persists.
Six employees had to be careful with injuries.
We're not going to tolerate violence in our prisons, and we're sure that those in charge of this altercation will have to pay back to the police and they might have to spend even more time in the cage."
There are more than 500 inmates in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, he learned that the head of the prison had to be put in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, anti-aircraft agents took action in prison to resolve a serious altercation in which the centre's personnel were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with important streams (the areas with even might be beneficial)
It's not common for tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of the week that comes when what's left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert of the south-west, with the consequent risk of laughing.
The national weather service has already issued signals for rivers for Mondays and Tuesdays west of Arizona to south and east of Nevada, south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday, and that she will be approaching Monday night with rains.
Phoenix's national weather service commented on a pillage that only "ten tropical cyclists have kept the state of tropical storm or depression within a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stayed 64 km from the border with Arizona."
The latest models from the national centre of hurricanes provide 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where they would be recorded up to 150 mm in the Mogollon of Arizona.
Other areas in the south-west desert, including the central Rocalloses and the Great Conca, could record from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas that are at risk of rivers, the rain of the Rose could become a very good news, since the region suffers from a severe drought.
Although the laughs are a serious cause of concern, some of the precipitations could be very beneficial, as the region of the south-west currently suffers from a drought.
According to the U.S. drought control service, more than 40% of Arizona's state suffers at least extreme, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will play the land on the Lower California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have force of hurricane on Sunday mornings, with winds of up to 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes it lose strength.
So it's expected to hit the land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or Monday evening.
Precipitation in various parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of laughing.
According to weather.com, "a total of 75 to 150 mm of rain is expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm".
After that, the Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the border with Arizona at the first hour of the morning of the morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross Arizona state and reach south Utah well into the night of Tuesday.
"The main risk that we expect from the Rose or what remains of it are very strong precipitations in Lower California, the north-west of Sonora and the south-west desert of the United States," according to the U.S. National Hurricane Centre.
Rains are expected to cause dangerous rains and waste streams in the deserts, lovers of land slavery in the mountainous areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four detainees for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been detained under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshots in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton by 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he found himself stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in Radstock, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have made a call because any person who can have any kind of record of the facts with the phone is contacted.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered the misery and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to reject the ruthless and furious tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump decreed in an election act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "painted the messiness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh stated in front of the Thursday Congress, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of having sexually abused her for decades when both were teenagers.
Ford also stated in the view in relation to his attachment.
The president said Saturday that, on that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality and bravery."
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds of the legal world of our time, a lawyer with a wonderful service trajectory in the city," he commented to the many supporters of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as referring to the importance of the voter participation index in the mid-term elections.
"We're five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn't run, but actually I did," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for our big candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are dedicated to "resisting and obstructing".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote to be held in Kavanaugh's Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place as late as Friday, according to CNN, an assistant of the leaders of the Republican Party reported.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the waves of giants flying against the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast toward the end of the night, dragging many of the people to death and destroying everything they found in their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When the threat came by tsunami yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and didn't run away, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the BNPB Disaster Mitigation Agency in a communiqué in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, trunks, houses, destroyed everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There are people who climbed up a tree running from the tsunami and were able to survive, comment.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency, where the quantity of destroyed shops and buildings, turned bridges, and a water mask is appreciated.
The replicas continued to shake this coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquake series were heard in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that energy released by the Friday earthquake effort was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the city's geographical characteristics, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the volume of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "respectable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped among the ruins of the ruined buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were displaced.
According to Nugroho, the deaths and damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, a zone called Dongala, closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communication "was totally paralyzed and therefore no information came," says Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross commented in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, which, unfortunately, could end up much worse," she says.
The agency was strongly criticised on Saturday not to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the agents said the waves arrived during the time the announcement was issued.
In a recording of a social media associate, it can be felt as a man standing on the top floor of a building gives desperate warnings to street people about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a water wall bursts at the edge of the sea, carrying buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not authenticate to register immediately.
Earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut of the power supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun sending humanitarian aid to cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, evacuations continue to need food desperately, as well as other basic needs.
The city's airport is only reopened for aid tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths for Indonesia's tsunami is above 800.
The situation is very serious.
Despite the fact that World Vision workers in Dongala were able to arrive safely and safely in the city of Palu, where employees were deployed in shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they had to present scenes of total destruction, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's a disaster.
While the relief groups did the disappointing gesture of initiating relief tasks, some people complained that they were preventing humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, supplies and staffing of foreigners can only begin to fluctuate if the place where a disaster occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Red Cross of Indonesia, said.
"When the government says "Well, it's a national disaster," we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared."
While it was the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, the friends and relatives of the missing people kept the hope of the miracle and their loved ones avoiding the devastating tale of natural disasters.
Saturday, a child caught in a cage was rescued.
Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandano, the trainer of the national Indian parapent team, had trained two of the parapentists missing from the Asian Games, which were concluded early this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandadi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, there were his students.
"As a senior in the area of the parapet, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel between the parapentist community, he had sent desperate messages for WhatsApp to Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a grey check mark instead of a double blue mark.
"I think that means the messages were not received," he added.
Thieves take $26,750 while filling an automatic boxer in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a thief stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling up an automatic case in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy said the vehicle driver was emptying the auto boxer in the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While he was doing his job, another man "was running behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for the distribution.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper renames to Ye
The Kanye West rapper's name is changed to Ye.
Saturday, as he announced the change to Twitter, he wrote: "To be formally known as Kanye West."
A long time ago, in the West, 41-year-old, he was called Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before its appearance in the Saturday Night Live program, which is expected to present its new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the programme's author.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," said West early this year, talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So it's you, it's us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means the only one, just Ye, that it's a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, all.
The album is rather a reflection than we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has known him by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for Love's and Brother Love's names.
JAY-Z, former West co-worker, has been worth his last name with or without script and in capitals.
Mexico President AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use the military force against civilians, when the country lacks enough to complete the 50th anniversary of a severe reparation against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "the military force would never again be used to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rooting across Latin America.
López Obrador, who has committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He said that the stop and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The US should duplicate IA funds
"While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money devoted to research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional specialist in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the North American Government have announced measures in the field of IA, although there is a general lack of formal strategy in the country in IA.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 of the world with regard to innovation in IA in 2030.
"Dublining the IA research budget would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be pioneers of the next advances in the IA field," Lee pointed out.
"Dublining funding could double the opportunities for the US to join the next great discovery in IA," Lee told the CNBC in an interview conducted this week.
Lee, author of the book AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent IA companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an I.A. system that beat the U.S. player in Othello with the best ranking and later practiced as executive in Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee positively assessed previous technological competitions of the North American Government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would take place to identify the next visionaries.
"Sovint, North American researchers have to work hard to get public scholarships," Lee said.
According to Lee, "It's not China that takes academic leaders; it's companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have contracted university eminences to work in the field of IA.
Lee commented that the task of the US in the area of IA could also be seen driven by changes in immigration policy.
"I think they should automatically offer permanent residence cards to doctors in IA," he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its latest-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
"The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other public agencies in the United States give money to North American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than China," Lee pointed out.
At the beginning of the year, the United States Department of Defence created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, designed to involve industrial sector and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Selection Committee of Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA has announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the Natural Sciences Foundation, more than 100 million US dollars are currently being spent in research in IA.
In the meantime, months ago, no measures were applied in relation to the North American legislation that he intended to set up a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name in the "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a step that would resolve a dispute that has existed decades ago with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its north neighbour constitutes a claim from its territory and has pledged its entry to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign doubts whether he will reach the minimum required participation of 50% so that the referendum is valid.
The question set out in the referendum paper is "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the consent of the agreement with Greece?"
Participants for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the country's future, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely in the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have shown that they will have the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of the registered people voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for Macedonia's referendum on the country's name change, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO to Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scenario and placing chairs in front of the tents set up by people who boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with the high head, not by the back door," Kavadarkov explained.
"I'm a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can resort to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO integration will be accompanied by investments more than you would need in Macedonia, which has a 20% stop rate.
"I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev demonstrated that a "yes" would mean "confirming our future".
In a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another survey, led by the Macedonian chain Telma TV, 57% of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said I would vote 'yes'.
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% more than one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard time for the pro-Western government policy since it took the lead last May.
Look at the video: Sergio Aguero, from Manchester City, makes a goal after flying the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defense in Manchester City win for 2 to 0 in the match at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Aguero scored a goal at 65 minutes in a game that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine front got a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He left quickly between three Brighton's defenses, tearing out what he was walking through the playing field with.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He gave up a defense before going over a few more on the edge of Brighton's area.
Then he made a passage to his left that he found Sterling.
The English front turned the pilot back to the first touch, inside the area, in Aguero, who with his right leg beat the porter of Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a jute that stuck inside the net on the right side.
"Aguero has trouble standing," Pep Guardiola, city coach, told reporters.
"We have decided that I would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are fortunate that I have marked a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the fight for the First League.
His goal came in 29 minutes.
In that game, Aguero received the pilot in depth in Brighton's field and
He made a beautiful passage into space on the left-hand side to Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the pilot before moving her to Sterling in the long suit.
Sky Blues' front ended the pilot inside the network before he got out of the background line.
The city faces at the Hoppenheim on Tuesday in the start of the Champions League group phase, at 18:55 p.m., at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, no options, wants to remove the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the game-off struggle, there were not many reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to get out at the launcher's mount Sunday that he's coming against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who keep an advantage party on Los Angeles Dodgers at the West League, have the opportunity to play the play-off.
The Rockies made sure a comedy with the victory for 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still seek to get their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can get out to know the environment here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably argue every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this game?"
The Nationals still have to announce an open launcher for Sunday, but they're apparently determined to let Scherzer slow down if this situation is given.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, made a hot session Thursday and would launch Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right-wing launcher has a record of 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump meets in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republicans' participation in half-term elections.
"All we've done is in November.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I don't present myself, but actually I do, so I'm everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
They're determined to regain power by all the means necessary, they're seeing their machine, their evil intent.
They don't care who they hurt, about who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The democratic mission, he said, is to "resist and obstruct".
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he retorted, and titled the Democrats of "enraged, miserable, dirty and false".
Trump mentioned Diane Feinstein, the highest-ranking democratic senator of the Senate Judicial Committee, as he provoked a strong crowd vote.
"Remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait a minute... this was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labor Party has ceased to be a different party.
It's intolerant to those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
Finally, I am the last of a series of British parliamentarians to whom we have been told that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he was determined against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the censorship motion, I was criticized for discriminating with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, is ironically similar to that of which Jeremy disagrees with previous leaders.
In the wake of the Friday meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party, it was announced that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday night have been exactly that way.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and a long time ago the promise of "most generous and kind" politicians has been forgotten, if it ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the party's direction.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, since you associated with those who previously thought he shared a political vision that seemed to me to turn 180th and take positions that I would never have adopted, either on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made because my candidacy is not renewed, the central policies are being denounced and I'm told it shouldn't be at the Labor Party.
And that's not just me.
In fact, I know that I have more luck than some of my colleagues, because the messages I get are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues that every day have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and they don't get up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer that different party, and with each movement of "untrustworthy" or each change in the selection rules, the party is getting tighter.
In the last two years, I've received a lot of advice and I've been advised to keep my head down, that it wasn't so expressive and that it'd all go well.
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labor Party 32 years ago, in my age of student, motivated by thatcher's negligent government, who left my whole class literally inundated, I've tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have any doubt about my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the Friday movement, I would say that at a time when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labor Party.
But, in fact, the message I want to convey did not lead to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are laborers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of any renewal of my candidacy or political interest will prevent me from acting, in my opinion, in favour of the interests of all of you.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Some Fathers undercut the leader
Two last-hour attempts have distorted the final outcome, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs won the victory in this vibrant game of Tenning's Premiership Day.
The Ayrs, who are the only intruded team of ten, take the first position on the classification table.
In the end, the local team was imposed thanks to its defensive superiority and the fact that he knew to take better advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
"The parties we've played so far have tested us and we're still being beaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: “Thanks to the Ayrs, they have taken advantage of the best opportunities than we have.”
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put before the Ayrs, but a yellow card for the Scottish international Rory Hughes, handed over by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggot noted an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended the Ayr advantage with a penalty and, just in the middle of it, he noted and converted a trial to put the 17-5 marker in favour of the Ayrs to rest.
But Melrose began the second part well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Then the party was interrupted for a long time because of the serious injury that Ruarid Knott suffered, which he withdrew into a letter, and in the repression the Ayrs again extended the distance with a trial of Stafford McDowall converted by Climate.
Next, the full captain Blair Macpherson was shown with a yellow card and again the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of another man with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of intense pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a landing in Climo without a pilot, since the penalty alignment, MacPherson noted a countertest behind the Ayrs' penetrated mill.
Climo marked, as he had done almost again since the arrest, after Kyle Rowe picked up a David Armstrong jute and passed the pilot on the third line to Gregor Henry to note the fifth attempt of the local team.
The Still Game series star seems to be ready to start a new career in the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be ready to go to the hospitality sector after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor, Jack Jarvis, plays the character of the BBC's popular series, writing and co-protagonizing with Greg Hemphyll, his comical partner for a long time.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although a source of the newspaper The Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter the "florent sector of the restoration" of Glasgow.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, without the coast, hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
The sailors patrol for their ship covered with cargo in La Paz.
Public buildings wear a sea blue flag.
The ship bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are jammed with the slogan: "The sea is our right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Around the coastless territory of Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a conflict of cruel resources in the 19th century remains very vivid, as it is the desire to reinvigorate the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the impulses, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, no need to say, wait with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at TIJ's resolution in large screens around the country, with the hope that the Hague Tribunal will issue a claim in favour of Bolivia that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, facing a controversial battle for the next year's election, also has many hopes deposited in the Monday resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favour of Bolivia and that, if it did, things would not change much.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no authority to assign Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of the possible conversations.
The TIJ resolution, which takes place only six months after the submission of the final allegations, indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from seeing each other out, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a relapse in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has kidnapped the issue of access to the sea," Zárate pointed out.
"The blasphemous rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile," he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold talks after this episode.
The two countries have not been exchanging ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in La Haia, rejected the idea that the court's decision was exceptionally rapid.
The next Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of discrimination, with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not remove nuclear weapons unless he can trust Washington.
Nothing spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy that was stopped more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri says it's a queer to think that the US's continued sanctions and objection to a declaration that will end the Korean War can make North Korea ever to get ahead.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not make significant disarmament movements.
Both Kim and North American president Donald Trump want to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang takes the matter seriously to give up an arsenal that the country considers the only means to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The fashion parades in Paris reveal the latest range of large-scale hats, from the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented at the pass a range of disproportionately disproportionately sized hats from their SS19 collection, which highlighted the style defined in the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been torn apart by very few practical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the passageway.
Valentine's highlight was an excessive bee hat, decorated with a wide wing, in the form of lead, that flooded the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were jewelry syndromes, a witch hat and even a pine, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extrafoliative masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of living colors, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than not a tall sewing suit.
One creation looked like a complete team of submarines, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like a frozen cone outside.
And if you follow the big fashion trends, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
Large-scale hats shake the heels of the "Bomba", a ball hat, with a two-foot wide coat that everyone has brought, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the little hat that spread across social networks brought another great creation to the passageway: a ball bag for the beach, almost as big as the model dressed in bathrobes that it wore.
The red, dark orange bag, decorated with rafy locks and finished with a white leather nose, was the highlight of the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus in the Week of Paris Fashion.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see people carrying large decks and beach bags to the main streets next summer. Considering that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a shame to ignore the demand for large accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a course of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are working to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for higher and higher education, for the career they choose, and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a very popular and desirable matter of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will come to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will come to his heart."
This is a very important reminder that we cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the exams, we can see that the languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages obtained the upper A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS students reflected that 72% of students received a higher qualification A in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as an election assignment, are kept in the same consideration as STEM assignments (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey carried out by the United Kingdom Employment and Competence Commission revealed that for reasons given by entrepreneurs to cover their vacancies, 17% were attributed to the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for future careers.
Since there are increasingly potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the race that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competency like that.
The fact that you can communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov among over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double digit.
For this reason, investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Knowing a number of languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find important work.
In Scotland there is diversity between schools in terms of the languages they learn.
Some schools focus more on the most traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important to the United Kingdom in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your son's interest, he will always be able to choose between a number of languages in independent schools, which include teaching professionals in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the necessary skills to be successful, regardless of what the future may be.
In the global trading environment of the present time, languages cannot be denied that they remain vital for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scottish people.
It needs to be done.
John Edward is director of the Independent Schools Schools Council
LeBron will start with the Lakers in San Diego Sunday
Hope's almost over for the fans who want to see LeBron James playing their first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first pre-season game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still have to determine the minutes you're going to play.
"They'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at the lakers' official place.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers journalist, tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After the beginning of this week's training, James was asked about his plans for the timing of the Lakers' six pre-temporary parties.
"I don't need pre-temporary parties at this stage of my career to be ready," he exclaimed.
Trump Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump launches a wave of campaign events tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first five scheduled meetings for next week, including visits to sympathetic places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court vacancy is pending, Trump intends to get support for the next half-term elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 a.m. today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can be seen online on the link specified below, via live video transmission for YouTube.
Trump is probably interrupting the hearing started this week with the candidate appointed to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was touched by the allegations of sexual abuse he is facing, while the Senate's pre-confirmation vote remains pending until one week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this wave of meetings is to help the Republicans present in the delicate November elections to collect momentum.
Therefore, the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for next week are aimed at "stimulating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, while we are heading for a busy campaign season," said a Trump spokesman who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
Tonight's meeting, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could bring together supporters "from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the coverage of the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the investigations.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to give him impetus in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the North American team shows its ambition to keep the hope alive for the individual Sunday parties
After three unequal sessions, the Saturday foursomes in the afternoon were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The basculent pendulum of dynamics is an invented sport concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So on which side is the positive dynamic now?
"They have a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're in a little positive direction," said Jordan Spieth as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points forward, with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely because of the state-forming of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spielth has been lethal from tea to green and is giving examples.
The gutural screams of celebration rose from intensity as he continued his turn and became a crucial bitch to push the fourth party, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the whore that made them win the party in the hole 15 with a similar cry, indicating that he believes the American team is not yet out of competition.
"You've got to make the most of it and worry about your own party," Spieth said.
It's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes to leave a print.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable feeling of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four or four and do not make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a crazy Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the crazy Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last new holes Friday morning.
As a result, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from public bubbles, it is reaffirmed that they are the players on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun is on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different doors.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson ended quickly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's furballs, who married Alex Noren.
A box and two doubles in the first nine holes poured Spanish and Swiss into a hole of which they had never had a choice to go out.
Sunday, but there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The furballs and fursoms are very fascinating to see through the interactions between the appliances, the advice that they give and the advice that they don't give, and the way a strategy can change over and over again.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this forum session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe reaches the end of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 marker
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after the end of the Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, the two-year-olds worked hard to win two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave their record, until now, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captain of Thomas Bjorn, who was keen to preserve the trophy he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated a little American team in the morning's four-balls and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to the forums and won two parties, but they could not reduce the differences.
Jim Fury's team needed eight points at the 12 individual Sunday parties to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter to achieve four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple to win four points in their first four matches in the story of Ryder Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed at the fourballs, they staged a brilliant performance to beat a Woods blowout and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had been dragged into two parties on Saturday, showed sporadic sparks of genius, but lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning’s football, remarried with Henrik Stenson’s foursomes and fell by 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, classified as the first and third of the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have everything on its face on a pleasant and windy day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Speeth, three times a tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set up a reference point on Saturday for the Americans getting two points.
They won a victory with determination by 2 to 1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter at the fourballs and later again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy at 4 to 3 in the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's story a team had raised a difference of four points to individual parties, although Furyk's team, a title advocate, just needs to pack it up to preserve it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a contraction Sunday is coming out of its scope.
North Korea declares that it will not be unilaterally disarmed "in any way" if they do not appreciate signs of trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister announced on Saturday to the United Nations that the continued sanctions were intensifying his mistrust in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the Annual General Assembly of the North Korea World Agency that it had taken "significant good will measures" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, disarming the nuclear testing centre and committing itself not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't see any response in the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not start disarmament unilaterally in any way."
If Ri resumed the well-known North Korea complaints about Washington's resistance to a phase-by-phase denuclearization approach that would reward North Korea as it gradually took action, his statements seemed significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement that Kim Jong One and Donald Trump made at the first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim committed to working on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to formally put an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists that denuclearisation must be done first and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal coercively, in addition to opposing the "war's end declaration," Ri pointed out.
"The perception that sanctions will make us kneel down is a camera of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are intensifying our distrust."
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader highlighted to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the part involved in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stagnation situation."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what he kept last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that pointing to the US territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump titled Kim "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
Now in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but demonstrated that there is still much to do and that sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo said Thursday to the UN Security Council that: "The application of the Security Council sanctions must continue energetically and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearisation".
The Security Council has unanimously launched sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in a bid to cut the funding of Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had been advances, but in a few hours North Korea accused him of making "own demands for a gangster".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantle a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "consonance measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "consonance measures" he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
Now, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat culture, increasingly extended, to study throughout the night, stimulated by the caffeine.
One scholar observed that students at the number one university in the world are often upset about the basic aspects of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after talking about the impact that sound deprivation had on learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl approached me and said, "Why are they telling me all this in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of the sound, which surprised me," The Telegraph reported.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are told basic concepts about how good sound habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said that the University decided to introduce the course after he learned that some students had severe sound deprivation during the week.
The course, from an hour of duration, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, bamboos and books to get information about the effects of the café and light, about how sports performance affects the lack of sound, and about the importance of keeping a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
"We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes for health," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to stay awake all night still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and growing pressure that students suffer make sound deprivation a growing problem.
Making sure to enjoy a sound of good quality for a long time should be a "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, added, even to avoid weight gain, as the loss of the sound puts the brain in insanity and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in Physics and Physics, helped Professor Cheisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard during his first year.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to promote the course throughout the camp.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to carry out a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students take into account the fact that they have an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light that emit the electronic displays and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circaday rhythm and cause noise problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with men from Gerrard
The goal of Dolly Menga condemns Steven Gerrard's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat at the Livingston house, which is supposed to be another outbound.
The whole of Ibrox was trying to add his first victory to his home from last February's triumph for 4-1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team attacked Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach to leave his team in the drift, at 8 points of the Hearts, unparalleled leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before half, and it never seemed like Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equal the marker.
While Rangers now fall in the sixth place, Livingston stands in the third position, behind the Hibernian by way of goals.
And Rangers could face more difficulties later, as the Calum Spence line judge needed medical attention for a head wound caused by an object that apparently was thrown out of the fence.
Gerrard made eight changes in respect of the alignment that cleared the Ayrs at the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven headlines that he set up a point against the Hearts last week.
Although the Rangers dominated possession, Livingstone created more danger when they had the pilot.
In fact, they should have marked in the two minutes of the match, when Menga's first intervention left Scott Pittman alone in front of Alan McGregor, but the uncampaignist fell away and took advantage of the great opportunity.
A miscarriage of Keaghan Jacobs met Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow only made a trial turned on the back.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than they believed in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a penalty on the five-minute signal, since he and Steven Lawless met, but Albert Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only directed two judges to the front door, but the first porter of the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibally's head shot and the doctor in front of Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi in 34 minutes could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only because of their efforts.
Again, the Rangers couldn't compete with Jacobs' work.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the pilot to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard took the break to change Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change had a practically immediate impact, since the extreme made a pass to Morelos, even though the imposing Kelly ran into the lockdown.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture the attention of visitors playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long walks, one behind the other.
Holt's band could have given direction in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow did a wrong from the cornet.
The Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton still asked for a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but Thomson again made his eyes big.
German: the inventor of Count Geiger
And now a page of Sunday Morning German: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally gave rise to the device we know as Geiger Count.
Count Geiger, who has been a pillar of science since then, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", staged by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, a seemingly failed vampire physicist:
Home: "What's in it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms that emanate from the radioactivity on the minerals."
Evans: "Surely he's blowing up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and remove malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells and altering them in the laboratory.
You can "see" a common protein in many cancers and then inject them again.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovary cancer that she suffered for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells, altering them in the laboratory to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then injecting them again.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "favors the growth of various types of cancer", including that of mom, ovary, lung and colorectal, has explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach is to extract the patient's immune cells and "teaching" these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West got pregnant on a pro-Trump diatrabe with a MAGA cap after its performance in the SNL program.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was enrolled in the study during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump, and said he would be presented in the 2020 elections.
After his third night song, entitled Ghost Town, wearing a cover of Make America Great Again, began criticizing the Democrats and repeating their support in Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people, they say, how can you like Trump if he's a racist?
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee for allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not issued, the eater Chris Rock picked up the recording of West's disapproval on social networks.
It wasn't clear if Rock intended to ridicule the West with the publication.
However, the West complained to the public that it was not well dealt with among the builders because of the roof she was wearing.
"They threatened me among the builders.
They told me you didn't go out with that covered hat.
I've been bitten.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
The West continued, "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he said he would put on Superman's coat, so he couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments provoked the crowd's screams at least twice, and the members of the program team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, who had a reporter who explained in the publication: "The whole study remained completely mute."
West was acting as a replacement for the last hour of Ariana Grande, the ex of which, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left a good part of the audience with the interpretation of song I Love it, dressed in Perrier's ampoule.
West got the support of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for being among the multitight."
But the presenter of the debate program, Karen Hunter, tweeted that the West was just "being who it is and that it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen not to reward someone (including his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I think adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had changed and that it was now "to be once known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, before was called Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince music changed his name for a symbol and, later, the artist previously known as Prince.
Probation of attempted murder at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed on Friday east of Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the court of Belfast's first instance on Monday.
The prosecutor will check the charges.
The Throne Game Star, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to represent the paper of the Jon Snow disaster in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the male hero's stereotype, claiming that these papers suggest that young boys often believe they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said he believed that "something had gone wrong" and that he wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married the co-proportionist of the Throne Game, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that she was very determined to deal with this problem.
"Personally, now I wonder where we have been wrong about masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we now experience?"
According to Kit, television can share responsibility for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its so-called virile characters.
He added, "What's innate and what's acquired?
What does it teach on television and on the streets that young boys feel they have to have this facet of virility?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
'Cause there's no doubt something wrong with young boys.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any prequeula or sequela of the Throne Game when the end of the series is scheduled for the next summer, saying he is made of battles and horses.
As of November, Kit will stage a position of work True West of Sam Shepard, which explains the story of a cinematographic producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that knowing his partner Rose is the best thing that has provided him with a throne game.
"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life ahead," she said.
Rose was making Ygritte's paper, the love of the character that Kit, Jon Snow, represented in an Emmy's fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases of 14%
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
Only the second quarter of 2018 reported 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases are sexual transmission, unlike what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people fighting HIV for this cause has fallen almost to zero, according to Chinese health officials' statements at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality broke out in China in 1997, but discrimination in the LGBT collective is common.
Given the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who maintain homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to lack of adequate precautions for sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has filtered data from Republican Party senators and demounts "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters reported on Saturday the accusations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that his applications were driven by criticisms and extreme right websites.
"Little lies, lies, and more reprehensible lies," Waters stated in a Twitter statement.
Apparently, the information published contained addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, and it was published by someone unknown in the Capitol during a session of the Senate commission on sexual abuse complaints against the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was filtered after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and that it revealed the information of a Waters staff member, the Capitol reported.
"This baseless complaint is completely false and a pure lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of which have been compromised because of these false and fraudulent complaints, was not responsible in any way for this information filtering.
This baseless complaint is completely false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of the press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation," Fleischer wrote.
"That makes you think you don't have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
You don't have to question the defendant's motives.
You must keep calm and sire."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, to whom critics accused themselves of looking too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to overthrow Waters in the mid-legislative elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Importing if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We will make sure that the criminals are revealed, continued, "and that they will be legally held responsible for all the actions that have been carried out and that they have harmed all and every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Criticism Again: Rowan Atkinson Limited Spy Parody
It is already a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this position of the Francisce of Johnny English's action-comedy parody, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is not an exception.
This humorous self-satisfaction about how insignificant we are will be a new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the out-of-court and rubber-faced Johnny English has been able to renew his license for the second time to twist it all. His name indicates more than anything else that is a comical creation designed for non-English speaking territories with tradition of going to the cinema.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the topic of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious traveler Atkinson, who now represented Barclaycard's forgotten TV ads, where he seemed like chaos all over the world.
There's one or two good times on this last J.E. journey.
I loved Johnny English, who was next to a helicopter dressed in a medieval armored suit, and the sheets of the helical were repeating it in the helmet.
You see the gift Atkinson has for physical comedy, but humor seems quite fluid and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" cinematographic brands like 007 and Mission Nes now include comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be intended for children more than adults, and, for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as ingenious or focused as the dumb gags of Mr. Bean, who represents Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical assumption now is that Britain is in serious problems.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the British super-secret web spy network and has revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, which leads to the consternation of the service agent, a pitifully small paper for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last resource for a prime minister who's a pretentious and obsessed figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of her own with this pessimistic character from Teresa-May, but the script doesn't come up anymore.
Their intelligence advisors inform you that, as each active spy is in danger, he will have to recover some of his retirement.
And this includes the ill-fated Johnny English, now employed as a professor in some luxury institution, but teaching extra-official classes about how to make a hidden agent, with some good gags, like now when English offers a espionage academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his sequential sufferer Bough, a paper that re-presents Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic paper, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit untapped.
Thus, Batman and Robin of when things get very light in the secret service of His Majesty enter into action once more and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the charm of the technological billionaire charismatic who claims that he can solve Britain's computer problems: the late Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hate of ridiculous madgeries: dressed in rooms, they fire a French fast-food restaurant, they sow chaos by smuggling along Volta's luxury iota, and English causes a great confusion in trying to use a helmet of virtual reality to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been pulled out of this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise that comes along, everything looks like a child program.
Pretty normal stuff.
Like the other Johnny English movies, it has not been helpful to think if the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a paper that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it's the idea of a plan for British people to have a four-day work week and cover five of them.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party will have to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week and charge five.
The party, of course, wants the heads of companies to pass the savings obtained by the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers by giving them a more party day.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would match the economic agenda of the parties and plans to turn the country towards workers.
The change to a work week of four days is supported by the trade union federation Trade Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced Labour Party source stated to The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
It won't be overnight, but a four-day work week is a aspiration that fits the party's perspective of balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly at present.
According to a spokesperson of the Labour Party: "A four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
The minister in the shadow of John McDonnell used the party's conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The minister's plans in the shadows also imply that water company shareholders could not recover the entire investment, as the labor government could apply "deductions" for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers in the company's joint ventures and to create property funds included to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees, who expect annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains in "60 minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court at least one week, and has raised the question as to whether the Agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be published on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that made them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Speak it seriously," said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the charges became public, and I asked him if he had.
He was firm, determined and sure."
But Graham's vote seems to be on fire.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I'd have an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejected it round," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people he calls will be able to verify.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressive star program, which will complete an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition of the present year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the overall objective of the event of ending extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help to combat it actively.
To receive a free entry for the event (although someone wants to pay a VIP entry), the assistants had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a telephone call or any other activity to raise awareness of the purpose of ending poverty.
What success has Global Citizen now spent 12 years on reaching its goal?
The idea of awarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call for action or just another case of what we call "clitivism" (people who think it marks the difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, who have helped to achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over US$ 37,000 million, which would have affected the lives of more than 2,250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group discussed 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least USD 10,000 million have already been disbursed or recovered.
The group estimates that at the moment, sheltered funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the The Power of Nutrition Foundation, an association of investors and realists with them in the United Kingdom, which undertakes to "help children grow as much as possible" and promises to send 35 million US dollars to Rwanda to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens' tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn social injustice of malnutrition into a bit of a side of history," said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on his website, he asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said, "It'll be a long and hard way, sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But as the great defence movements of civil rights and against previous apartheid, we will triumph, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will play the event in New York now, who will present Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to obstruct Russian energy exports (secretary of the Interior)
Washington may, "if necessary", use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting the markets, including those in the Middle East, has revealed the US Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke has reported that Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates with the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern bank of Europe," he reportedly said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that maritime life is open and, if necessary, to block it, to prevent its energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees to the event celebrated by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that self-defined as the "view of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and he pointed out that they are actually equal.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of taking advantage of and replacing fuels," he said, while indicating that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements arrive while Trump administration has been on a mission to boost export of its natural gas liquefied to Europe, in substitution for Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officers, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to leave the North Stream 2 "unadequate" project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a Moscow "captiu".
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which has cost $11,000 million and will double the gas pipeline capacity of 110,000 million cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Department secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The position of the US has led to a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the German industry, FDI, has called on the US to separate EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said "will think carefully" his presidential candidacy in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that he would "think carefully" his candidacy for the presidency after the mid-legislative elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government's fracture, for women to take high positions," The Hill said.
"After November 6, I will take my candidacy as president seriously."
Warren intervened on President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said "he was bringing the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm really worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said, "Of course, I need an FBI investigation before the elections."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed it should not be presented by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said that the senator should not appear, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The investigation revealed a broader support for the candidacy of the former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent in favour of a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other high profile names among the Democrats that took into account a possible candidate for 2020 include Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd officially reveal his decision on January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites the effect of TEPT Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after being listed on September 11, 2007
Monday night he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident
"With what's happening to my own son since he came back, I can understand other families that suffer branching from TEPT and some of the emotional wounds with which our soldiers return," explained to the audience at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the next of his son and other war veterans, "they're a little different, they're getting tired, they're back wondering if there's respect for what their soldiers and pilots, as well as any other army member, have given to the country."
He was arrested on Mondays in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence to a woman, with a declaration of domestic violence and armed tenacity under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, you brought the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives of 18 states and the district presented a friend on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs Sessions request that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented the month of August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and the children of the member of the violent band" attacked him, but the North American officials denied his asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum-seekers are born in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy withdrew a 2014 decision from the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to seek asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, Karl Racine, said Friday that the new policy " ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal laws require asylum applications to be awarded according to the facts and particular circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the friend caree.
The lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denies immigrants' entry is damaging the US economy, as it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "proportion necessary jobs".
In June, general prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or a concrete political opinion," Sessions said in their announcement of June 11th of this policy.
The asylum never meant to ease all the problems, not even the worst, people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts desperate in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprite to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma while calming her son with fever in an evacuation centre in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings bodies.
Drinking water is missing."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to take on flood belonging and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injuries, and the hospitals, unscrupulous by magnitude 7.5, are saturated.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Harris, which broke the shoulder, are outside Palu's military hospital, as patients are being treated outside because of the strong bags that are repeated.
The tears denied his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room of the fifth floor of the hotel where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
"I heard my wife asking for help crying and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The US ambassador charges China with "advertising announcements".
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page ad in a North American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the North American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed China Daily's payment supplement to The Des Moines Register, the most-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of joining the US Congress on 6 November, accused China of denying it.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to implicate itself in the US elections marked what North American officials have explained to Reuters that it is a new phase of Washington's campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to include advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has seen the oranges put on mutual imports.
China's vengeful tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at punishing state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and North American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had damaged workers, farmers and United States companies.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article at The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It is redoubled by the publication of advertising ads to our free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the estimated North American tradition of freedom of expression and free press to include a payment ad in The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In exchange, in the kiosk that is down here in Beijing, you will find few dissuasive voices and you will not see any real reflections of the disparate views that Chinese citizens can have on China's worrying economic path, since the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers was the offer to publish" his article, but he didn't say the name of the publication.
Republicans separate women's voters before mid-legislative elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
As many of the major Republicans support and defend the candidate in the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which faces several requests for sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, in the next mid-legislative elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high, and most Republicans are already officially showing that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political sciences at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, in The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-hour pressure (R-Arizona) to complete an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow, or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesman of the Progressive Group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington's newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors called "November is coming!" (November approaching) as they appeared in the Senate lobby, while the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to continue with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the witness of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will remain outside the chart," explained Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they've already been tall; it's true.
But it could have been more, especially among the voters of women from the suburbs and the younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who often do not vote until they like the president."
Even before the Ford's public witness, where he detailed his sexual assault applications to the candidate in the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative response could be made if the Republicans pressed with confirmation.
"This has become an embolism for the GOP," said Michael Steele, president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the vote of the board or the final vote, nor if Kavanaugh sits in the bank of the accused, it also has to do with how the Republicans have handled this issue and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, U.S. Priorities Director, a group that helps to elect Democrats, in the news channel.
However, the North Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's star and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the balance that is slightly cut to the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the surveys believe in no doubt or likely in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim to believe in no doubt or likely Kavanaugh.
Also, about 38 percent said that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or doubted during his testimony, while about 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating requests filed by Ford and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez complains that the candidate to the Supreme Court taught the genitals at a party while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that plans to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company based on the open code platform of Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intention of Inrupt was "dominating the world".
"We must do it now," said the company emerging.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own personal data store or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in a browser at the same time.
What is exclusive of the personal data store is that the user is who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is that the company integrates adequate resources, processes and capabilities because the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said none of his team is talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty during the night.
"We're not asking permission."
In a Saturday publication in the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even during the Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the I GM Victory Cross
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the guard on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was beaten by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the most important British military honor.
Their two grandchildren evicted a memorial stone on a Saturday parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's guardianship.
According to The London Gazette, September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very thick noise and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns".
Later he ran to the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage", made the row move before he threw himself over a cannon with one hand and left three members of the stand.
Lieutenant Colonel was beaten by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's actions were a proselyte that could never be equal, which gives you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of an authentic hero is shown by support that he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who stayed out of sleep all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you're awake all night to see Bellator 206 and you're told to see the most important event.
San José's cartel contained 13 matches, including six of the main card and had to be seen live all night in the United Kingdom at Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the UK’s spectators were caught when the programming changed Peppa Pig.
Some became disillusioned with having spent the night awake until the morning to see the struggle.
A Twitter follower described the change in animated drawings as "a sort of vomiting acuid."
"The government's legislation says that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they changed to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and Bellator's communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa la cotta, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would work on programming to include the UK's spectators in the future.
"I think when I think of repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there's six in the morning of a Sunday and we can't solve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at yours.
But we're working there.
Believe me, when I changed the channel, there were many messages that went and came, and they weren't all nice.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do, we tried to show it again by the followers, but it's over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to triumph.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
In the Desert Island Radio 4 Discs program presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give hope to other people.
He also said that being a father had remained important to him in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the long-term programme, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months to get sick.
Daley, who appeared as a shipwreck in Laverne's first program, said he felt "less than" the others because "he was not socially acceptable as children and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me the power and strength to triumph."
I wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so that no one would be disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
Twice the winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image of the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to describe homosexuality.
He said that he had spoken because he was happy to be able to live openly without branches and that he wanted to give hope to others.
The world's tri-campione explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the North American realist Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "he caught me by surprise."
Last year, Daley married Oscar's winner, 20 years older than he did, but he says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you are young, it is hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced both high and low levels of cancer when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple were parents to a child's June who named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and according to Daley, "all his perspective" changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is said to be the same as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die, and one of the last things he asked for was whether they had already entered London in 2012, because he wanted to be on the front line.
"I couldn't tell him, 'stop, you won't be there to take the first row," he said.
"As he held his hand, he stopped breathing and wasn't even then, he was already dead, which I finally agreed he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in some Olympic Games. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Heather Small Proud), which he had heard during the preparations for the Olympics and was still wearing chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A worse Mikkelson introduced himself to Ryder Cup on Saturday.
North American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday to play his 47th party at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his physical status if he doesn't want to become an unhappy match.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to record for 12th time, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" modes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as usual for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments shares his time between making an animator and working on his game in the field, hoping to correct what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the moment of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult Le Golf National route, where the long rough is used to punish the turned-off blows.
And if his own route isn't quite discouraging, Mikelson, on Sunday's new game, will face the exact British Open Camp, Francesco Molinari, who joined the Tommy Fleetwood rocket to win the four matches this week.
If the North Americans, four points down at the beginning of the 12 individual parties, start strong, the Mickelson party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He perfectly understood his role for that day, made me a palm tree on my back and surrounded me with his arm while he told me he would be ready the next day," Furyk said.
"You have a lot of confidence in yourself.
It's a hall of fame and it's brought a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained and that's how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like anyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup games.
It can mean the end of a race at Ryder Cup that didn't equal his individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 fourths, although Furyk has said his presence has brought intimabitable to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke about people and he's a big teammate," he explained.
"I think the younger players were also having fun staying with him this week, which was fun to see.
It brings much more to the side of your game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that beginning with a considerable advantage the individual dues of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become a hard day.
The Danish started in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team captained by Sve Ballesteros had an advantage of five points on the American team, but eventually they won the victory for at least 14.5-13.5.
"And you keep remembering that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little by little," said Bjorn, in the picture, after seeing the victory of the 2018 team for 5-3 as late as yesterday, leaving the score in 10-6 in Le Golf National.
The story has taught us to me and all the team members that are not yet finished.
He's got to go to the whole machine tomorrow.
You have to get out and do everything right.
This doesn't end until the bookmarks can't be placed in the bookmark.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I've already said that, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also have a view of who our rivals are: the best players in the world."
Charming the performance of its players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added, "I will never rush with this.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Individual performance will mark the difference tomorrow and change everything.
It's great to be with a partner when it's all right, but individual duels test your ability to play golf.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself."
In opposition to Bjorn, the rival captain, Jim Furyk, expects his players to deliver better individually than on team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin on the top of the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up losing in the "Miracle de Medina" that won Europe.
"I remember all the words," he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start with a good start, as was seen in Brooklyn and Medina.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure on these central duels.
We have prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of attempting to start the revolt against Rory McIlroy at the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the remaining Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I have chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities," says Bjorn about his choice for individual confrontations.
The new German warship, re-positioned
The new German Army fracture should have ended in 2014 to replace the former warships of the Cold War, but it will not, at least, do so until the year it comes from defective systems and an increase in costs, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class fractures, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but the post-construction problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Army commissioned in 2007 will replace the former Bremen-class fractures.
It is believed that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-bucs, as well as technology against theft actions, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new fractures up to two years without going through national ports.
However, these continued delays imply that the forward-looking ships, which were expected to be able to project in Germany as a powerful force abroad, will be obsolete when they enter into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 fracture was reported last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Drass of Hamburg.
It was the first time the Army returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
There are few details of the reasons why he came back, but the German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it inaccessible if used in combat missions.
The technical problems are important, as about 120 sailors, half the crew needed for the former Bremen class fractures, operate on Baden-Württemberg class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, as it reduces its performance and limits the Army's ability to add future improvements to it.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", of 7,000 tons, will weigh twice as many class ships as used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition to the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed that some amazings have arrived at EUR 3,100 million ($3,600 million) from an initial budget of EUR 2,200 million.
The problems of the new fractures have become a matter of special importance, if the recent warnings indicate that the military military power of Germany is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, has acknowledged that the Army "is missing ships that can be used".
The officer said the situation had worsened over time because they stopped using the old ships, but they were not provided again as replacements.
He complained that none of Baden-Württemberg's fractures could join the Army.
The National Foundation spys on the secret life of the victims
A new investigation carried out at a farm in the Highlands of Scotland is about to discover how the rats use the landscape to feed themselves.
Discovery is expected to provide new data on the behavior of these only flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will continue to be soprano and common, as well as northern earring and watering at the Inverewe Botanic Garden, located in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to monitor the activities of the rats during the station.
Volunteers and staff of the United Kingdom National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys with mobile detectors.
Analysing the sound of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the ratites and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed image on the scale of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant at the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes that the results show what areas of the habitat are more important to the rat population and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of the management of the habitat, such as the creation of meadows, and how to improve forest maintenance for ratites and other associated species.
The population of rats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has fallen considerably in the last century.
Building and building restoration tasks threaten rats, as they affect the nests and can cause loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and fire turbines are also at risk, as are the matrices and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as are domestic cat attacks.
In fact, rats are not blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a catch.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to place insects and obstacles in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taken very seriously.
He has ten experts with appropriate training, who carry out surveys, zero inspections and, at times, usually rescued.
Even so, the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to rats at the Thrave Estate farm, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of Scotland rats.
The financier, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a big area for the rats," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all a good habit.
But we still don't know many aspects of pain, so the work we do here and other properties will help us understand better what they need to grow."
It notes the importance of checking whether there has been a delay before doing property maintenance tasks, as the possible involuntary destruction of a single motherhood nest kills more than 400 women and young people, because it could lead to the disappearance of a whole local population.
The rats are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, torture them and destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Rats Conservation Foundation official, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still need to learn a lot about torments and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data on their population."
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape while his lawyers prepare a complaint against a German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has indicated that the charges of rape against him are "false news" and has said that people "want to be famous" by their name.
His lawyers will demand the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
Portugal's predecessor and Juventus have been accused of violating a US woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he paid $375.000 at the moment because the incident was not made public, according to the information published on Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a video of Instagram Live in which it was addressed to its 142 million followers hours after the charges were made public, Ronaldo, 33, claimed that they were "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says the five-time gold pilot winner in the camera.
"They want to be famous thanks to my name.
It's normal.
They want to use my name to make themselves famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything's in order," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the claim against Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they have qualified as "inadmissible information about privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral days for an amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in an illustrative manner, according to reports archived to the district court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy", except a "1%."
The papers say that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sexual relations, but they were agreed upon.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and photographed the injuries at the hospital, but later she accepted an agreement outside the courts because she had "a fear of reprisals" and was concerned "to be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to cancel the agreement, as she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to plant for King Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he fixed for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "always regret" losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would always regret" if you lost the world's lead in the manufacture after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota's base in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that, if the United Kingdom left the European Union without any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in the case of an unagreed Brexit could cause job losses.
The plant of Burnaston, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis models of Toyota, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK comes out of the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Getting out of the EU without any agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU countries will work has aroused the fears of other UK car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims to close Mini's plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to which manufacturers consider risks in the Brexit production chain without agreement.
Toyota's production line is carried out on a "just-time" basis, with fish coming every 37 minutes from UK and European Union suppliers for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the UK emerges from the European Union without reaching agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector considers could generate delays and scarcity of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and it would have to stop production as a consequence.
Clark states that Theresa May Chequers' plan for future relations with the EU is "acquired precisely to avoid these border controls".
"We have to reach an agreement, we want to get the best agreement that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4 Today program.
"The tests not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains."
Toyota has not been able to confirm for how long production would be stopped, but in the long run it has warned that added costs would reduce plant competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the United the Union on the ground, said that members start to be very concerned about the situation: "By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again
The expected meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "posted for a week" while continuing the fight on the appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, links between Russia and assistance to Trump and a possible obstruction in justice by the president.
If Trump's hired or not the Deputy Attorney General and he's risking Mueller's independence, he's been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking a microphone to record the talks with Trump and also the possibility of depositing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House among rumors he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, which was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said "I would prefer not" to say yes to Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate's judicial committee's hearing that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which led to a further delay in the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he answered, "Not yet a date has been fixed, it could be this week, although it may be that one more week will be set aside for all matters with the supreme court.
I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might object to this statement: Sanders hasn't had an informative session of the White House since September 10th.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he didn't like the fanfare of TV journalists, although he said, "I won't deny they're fans."
Next, he indicated that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president makes more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting any sources: "We have consulted these data."
Sanders said information sessions will continue to take place, but "if the press has the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me infinitely.
We often try to do that, you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks, and you'll replace the information sessions when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press circles with dignitaries on official visits.
Individual press wheels are not common.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance and, at some times, he is strange in front of the journalists gathered.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service from fears about Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter within six months of leaving the UK of the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the cost of state-of-the-art applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: "In the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and still seems to be heading towards the decisions expected this late.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also begun preparations in the event of a possible scenario without agreement.
I know it's time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate my deep appreciation for the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, provide valuable experiences and disasters that strengthen and improve the health service task, while benefiting the patients and communities we deal with.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after having a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers rereligion has undergone an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury on Saturday in defeat by 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ, Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before the middle.
"He came to the band line and exploded there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing it on a bed and taking it to test it more.
A Tennessee State officer reported to Chris Harris, WSMV from Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the workshop in the medical center of Vanderbilt.
Harris has added that "there is still no information on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after it's settled from Illinois.
I had completed five Saturday spots before leaving the game, which makes it a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom with the additional money used to help people without going home according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp tax will be recorded in those people who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom.
Hisenda expects to earn up to 120 million per year to help homeless people.
It is hoped that foreign buyers will have a higher stamp tax on buying a property in the United Kingdom and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more secure habitats that would affect the highest incomes.
The increase in stamp tax will be recorded in those people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; this money will be used for the government's action to combat the figures of homeless people.
The charge, which will be added to the current seal tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second estates and real estate speculations, could be up to 3%.
Hisenda expects to get up to 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are of non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many well-being areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "city ghosts" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes up weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in stamp tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the great constructs of keeping high the prices of the properties by quickly buying land and not using it, and urged May to cancel the contributions on affordable homes to correct Britain's real estate disaster.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as control over the rental and finalization of "no blame".
He also wants to give the assembly more power to build new homes.
May said the following: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it can't be as easy for people who don't live in the United Kingdom, as it can be for companies with them abroad, to buy habitat compared to British people who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home in possession is too distant and the indignity of homeless people makes it even more real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has said his "maximum ambition" is being Scotland coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotch has accepted the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which currently holds the third position at League One, at three points of the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
They called me once as a support, and that's all," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound program.
"But I grew up seeing a lot of playing Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was little and it's always a thing that makes me backward in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in training clubs, but."
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's training position include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's extraterrestrial claims that he doesn't feel the pressure to be next in a list of names dedicated to such a large team, after having previously rejected Barnsley's offers and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, my criterion for measuring my success will be if I can get this team back to the Premier League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that its place is the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd only think I'd been successful here if I could make it back to the club."
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in the hearts technical body.
She helped Alloa avoid falling into the third category and turned St. Mirren into fighting for the champion's rescue in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting the responsibility of Alloa.
"I always thought training was what was given me better than playing.
Sounds strange because I did it well, I got out reasonably, and I enjoyed pretty good times.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through things like stress and work pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've heard since I'm an adult."

The perfect time for a painting is 5:30 a.m. on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave has fired consumption at bars with difficulties in Britain, but it has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bars have increased by 2.7% in sales in July, but restaurant consumption has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's financial consulting, the company that has collected the data, says: "The continuous hours of sun and the participation of England in the world, which has expanded beyond expectations, have made July follow a pattern similar to June, with an increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The fall of 1.8% in consumption in June's restaurants has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have achieved the best results, while the consumption of restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we've consulted, the sales of drinks have increased by 6.6% during the month, while the sales of food have decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, from anacondas and RSM hotel analysts, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events continue to be the main factors related to the sales of the external steel market.
It's no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales of 4.8% inter-yearly would be particularly harmful, rather than constant pressure on costs.
This long and warm summer couldn't have come at a worse time for the food trades, and time would say if the more moderate temperatures we've had in August would provide such a necessary breath."
The total increase in bars and restaurants sales, including the recently opened ones, has been 2.7% on July, as the slowdown in brand presentation indicates.
The sector's sales indicator for restaurants, bars and taverns in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of more than 9 million pounds and is the established benchmark for the sector.
One out of every five kids has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One out of every five children, some 11 years old, has secret social networks that hide their parents and teachers, according to data from a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has shown an increase in "False Insta" pages
News has raised fears about publication of sexual content
20% of students claim to have a "main account" showing parents
One in five children, some in 11 years old, creates social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in Insta's false accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news has raised fears about publication of sexual content.
About 20% of students say they have a net "main" account showing their parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager telling others to "violate me."
Research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Private School Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools, has revealed that 40% of adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of which have admitted to having private accounts.
HMC's head, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" of the Scottish Federation of Athletics
Elid Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Federation of Athletics Directive at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the field athlete and track player with more Scotland medals, and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who take the sport to benefit from their international experience in the past decade.
"Eilid has respect for the community of Scottish athleticism, the United Kingdom and the world, and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as an athlete's voice and hope to make sport grow and contribute to Scotland."
The statesman, who won gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic gold and is currently the usual commentator of the BBC, was prevented from walking after a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote the following on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time would tell me if I could recover or to what extent.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today it's about to do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
An ad comparing mothers with cows shares their opinion on the Internet
A turtle company has divided its opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers to breast-feeding cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "first silent tyrantlet that can be carried out in the world", the consumer technology company Elvie has issued an ad inspired by a musical video of joke to show the freedom that gives the new tyrant to the mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a rag full of stuff and cows at the rhythm of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I care about myself, but you won't see a queue" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not funny, they're my tits."
The return continues: "Bombage, pumping, feeding babies, pumping, pumping, handing girls."
However, the ad, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from whom it has been seen, many of which claim to show the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and stand up to produce milk, with the difference that they are apart from their babies a few days after standing up," one wrote.
The Elvie tyrant is discreetly hidden in a babysitter (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "I understandably traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why don't you use them to announce a gun to mothers who will keep their babies?"
Another user added, "It's an off-site ad."
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song to be "for fun."
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Bombing for the trigger made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but you have to take what it is.
It's a great product," wrote a user.
Another person commented: "It's a fun announcement for mothers who bomb with turtles (usually at their place of work or at the toilet and feel like they're cows.
It's not an announcement that he's going to sue or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've all danced with the shooters discreetly left behind.
The concept that hides behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say that they feel like cows when they use the trigger.
However, Elvie's thyroid is completely silent, has no cable or tube and discreetly fits into a breast support, making it more free for women to move, subjecting babies and even getting out while they're bombing.
Ana Balarin, mother's first-born partner and developer, said: "The Elvie tyrant is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a daring and challenging campaign.
When we draw the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a thyroid is used and the challenges that it is supposed to do, while we demonstrated, entertaining and didactically, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new thyroid offers.
It's not the first time Elvie's shooter comes out on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the pass for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children, quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children detained has increased, although monthly entry through the border has remained virtually stable, in particular because the rhetorical hardness and policies introduced by Trump administration have made it difficult for children to become petrified.
Traditionally, most of the patrons were undocumented immigrants, who were afraid of risking their ability to stay in the country if they decided to take a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the potential employers and other adults living in their homes will have to send digital fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to receive unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80% of the people who have taken or lived in the home of a person who has taken them are illegally in the country, and a large majority of them are criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
In order to prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, instead of presence, to defend their case in order to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The more time children spend in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent ramps or runaway attempts, according to the workers and reports they've been able to get to know the system in the last few months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger installations, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, because of their size, the signs that a child is suffering may be overlooked.
They have added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to their friends can cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria urges the "occupational forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muulem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that war in the country has lasted for eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, has stated that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the "war of terror has practically ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have cleansed the entire Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of a country hit by war.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem stated that the conditions were good for his return and blamed "some Western countries" for saving "unreasonably," which make refugees want to stay away from them.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these return," he said.
"They're politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to put an end to the war.
US diplomats have said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral area at the last major rebel base, Idlib, has taken advantage of the opportunity to continue political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem noted that the agreement has "clear terms" and expressed the hope that military action will face the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
The staff of Mistura, sent by the United Nations, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee formed by government members and the opposition to begin profiling a post-war constitution and preparing the way to the elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, the task of which should be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the election again in 2020 when, as many liberal spectators are likely to expect, the scandals and the process of dismissal ended with his presidency early.
What it would be, of course, is "the end of a more dramatic presidency of history."
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in maximum attendance hours has doubled by up to 1.05 million to CNN and nearly tripled by 1.6 million to MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum audience time, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show, from MSNBC, has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"People have been beaten because they don't understand," says Neal Baer, an executive producer of the "Designed Survivor" ABC series, on a cabinet decree that turns out to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snaging Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
It commemorates a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her that he would vote Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"I replied that because I made him laugh," said Scovell.
There's a point of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the script coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can meet and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you find yourself in the sixth hour to see a group of experts discussing the use that Bob Woodward has made of "private use" sources for his book "Fare", Paul Manafort's construction leather jacket, "a piece of thick clothing like his pride", titled Washington Post, and the consequences of the horrifying descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, let's say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I'm not going to see Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes me seem to be part of a telereality program is that every night he gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the change of characters and tour of Trump's program (comparing with NFL, known as Kim Jong-One).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're behind you.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and he was alone outside the house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked up looking at the MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He couldn't get rid of it, not with Brett Kavanaugh, about to face the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we did those random programs then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it would be kind of a joke, but it looks like they were right."

External money inflates the middle-level parliamentary elections in the House of Representatives
It's no surprise there's an actual flood of money in Pennsylvania's 17th district, thanks to the realisation of the congressional districts that have made two current members compete for the same place.
This recent redeployment of Pittsburgh's suburban district involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won the seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were reduced after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decrees in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans.
The 17th district race has triggered a financial war between the party's main financial organizations, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb was named after an adjusted victory in special elections held in March to represent the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
Republicans have been in charge for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support in China, but withdraws them
The diplomats noted that the Dominican and Panamanian Republic had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners took out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw heads of US diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions on the failure to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokesman of the department this month.
However, only the possibility of punishing El Salvador, which in 2017 received US aid of $140 million, according to estimates, was envisaged for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial assistance and restrictions on issued visas, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high numbers of deaths per murder and arrest.
With the steps of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting centred on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar encounter last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from being addressed to the United States.
But in mid-September, high-level administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to take place, because it ended effectively with any probability of sanctions for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been elected to the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to it, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys discreetly returned to their posts in Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without hard messages or sanctions on Washington.
A spokesperson from Bolton's White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officers, including two diplomats, who agreed to debate internal deliberations since the anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from the anonymous, corroborated his statements.
History Study
The next event could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump in justice, of which there are numerous evidence in public records.
As far as we know, Mueller also investigates whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could be found reporting to the organization, just when he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even in front of a jury of party members.
These are many circumstances, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall, or none of his European homonymists, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to take a stand against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates on points of inflation like this and speeds up or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is currently facing a number of inflation points.
What will happen if Trump's remunerated Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General, is the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been watering his neck since this newspaper reported that last year, he suggested that he secretly record the president and speculated that he was not fit for the job.
Rosenstein claims that the information from the Times is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court all and the credible charges of sexual abuse and false witnesses?
And, in particular, will we vote in the middle of the legislature for a Congress that will be responsible for Trump?
If we don't go through these tests, democracy will start to run out of danger.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because I already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, he emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, he sent me to light up Saturday's lights on that table with the aesthetics.
With this luggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans, from Rangers, face-to-face optimist against the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers took Vienna's Rapid Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive empathy in the Vila-Real field this month, would leave it in a good position to classify itself as the G Group of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented unscrupulous Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until the fourth 2-2 against the Royal City, but he thinks Rangers can use this result as a trampoline to get great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because the Vila-real is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We played the game believing that we could get a valuable result and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something else out of it at the end, but generally the fourth was probably a fair result.
They were better at first, but we were better than at second.
On Thursday, it's another big European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it'll be a tough game because they brought a good result to the last match, but I'm sure we'll do it all and we'll get a good result with the support of the affection.
Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes to the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team's fine, and the boys enjoy it, training's good.
I hope we can do everything, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Women lose sound for fear of saving for retirement
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with the family.
About half of surveys at national level say they talked to their partner about the long-term cost of attention.
Only 10% of the respondents say he talked to the kids.
"People want some family to take care of them, but don't hesitate to think about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
We need to start over here.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not communicate with your wishes in advance.
He works with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to get attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: It may also help you to determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term funding options can include a long-term insurance policy for long-term care, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your own expenses or insurance with your own resources, if you have the money you need to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: Cut the pace in the legal battles.
Find a representative to be able to appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical attention and make sure that professionals fulfill your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the possibility of contracting a notary acquisition for your finances.
You should select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget about the little details: Imagine that your old family has a medical emergency and is on its way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor that has to be determined, but also which doctors want to deal with," Martin said.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready."
Man shot several times with an Ilfracombe compressed airbag
A man got several shots of a compressed air gun while he was back home after he got out at night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
'The officers described the shooting, which occurred around 2.30 in the morning (in the "british summer time"), as a "random act".
The victim hasn't seen his attacker.
His life is not in danger for the wounded, and the police have made a call to find witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a strong earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
As communications are cut, aid units have not been able to obtain information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu, near the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
The following include some important data about Palu and Dongala, in the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located at the extreme of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a regent extending over 300 km of the coast to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
The regency, a region less than one province, had a population of approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but mainly in Morowali, on the coast of the other extreme of Celebes.
Palu and Dongala have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami occurred in 1996 in west Dongala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific fire zone and earthquakes are frequently occurring there.
The following are the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Thousands of people died on Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 magnitude struck south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that devastated the south coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 - magnitude earthquake devastated a pop - area in Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude shook one of the islands of Mentawai on the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters [10 m] that devastated dozens of people and killed some 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pidie Jaya’s regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastating earthquake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died because of the collapsed buildings.
2018: A series of large earthquakes occurred in the Indonesian tourism island of Lombok, which killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.

Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested with charges of aggression.
Palin, aged 29, natural from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and arrest resistance, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a lady tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she stretched her phone.
Palin is detained in Mat-Su's temporary detention centre, where he is held with an unsecured liability of USD 500, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he declared himself "not guilty, safely" when he was asked how he was declared, according to this chain.
Palin faces three class A faults, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He's also accused of a class B deficiency, which can be punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fine.
It's not the first time criminal charges against Palin are registered.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference with the report of a domestic violence crime, and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in relation to the incident.
His wife declared that she had given a blow to his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups to associate her child's violent behavior with a posttraumatic stress disorder from her service to Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks don't work, and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just on the Central Celebes coast, north-east of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
On social networks, videos are circulating at the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived on the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for a suspect of the terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to launch an attack on a West Side Highway bike, down Manhattan, and hit passengers and cyclists during his trip in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors have to demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intendedly" and that "intendedly" caused serious personal injuries, according to the intent of requesting the death penalty presented to the South District of New York.
Both criminals could be subject to a death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury attacked Saipov with a 22-falt indictment that included eight counts of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required considerable planning and premeditation and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and devious."
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the intent notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South New York district brought a death penalty to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being sentenced by conspiracy to carry out espionage actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the days and months after the attack.
The police explained that he told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to bring the attack to an end after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also asked for the ISIS flag to be deployed in his hospital room.
It has been declared not guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the charge's decision.
"We consider that the decision to ask for the death penalty, instead of accepting a declaration of guilt and a permanent chain without the possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of the Conservative Party's parliament claims that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the conservative party conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "sinuate the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's parliament's own members suggested that they should lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MP without charge Peter Bone said at the beginning of Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May at the time of reconciling her deeply divided ranks was highlighted when the conservatives for the union presented themselves in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The prime minister is fighting to preserve his Chequers' commitment plan between the Brexit Party attacks, the Union and the EU.
The allies insist that they can reach agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the meeting Leave Means Leave of Solihull that he wanted to cancel the Chequers compromise.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be out,' he said.
The member of the Wellingborough parliament added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must undo the Chequers compromise."
To clarify its opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be helpful.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that claimed public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wants to stay there is totally false."
Brexit's conservative party Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said in front of reporters: "I'm just telling you, Prime Minister, that you listen to people."
"The Chequers compromise is unpopular among the general public, the opposition won't vote in favour, is unpopular among our party and our activists, who are the people who go out the street and get us to win a few elections.
Leave Chequers' compromise and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said that meeting politicians need to feel pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't let them."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure."
"We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the union partners marched for Birmingham before a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small number of activists shook flags on the conservatives against Brexit after the group was released this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Adonis laughed at the conservatives for the security problems they suffered with the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canadian agreement more, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit," she added.
Warren intends to examine the possibility of presenting himself as a candidate in the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would consider presenting himself as a presidential candidate after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, the usual critic of President Donald Trump, is presented for his election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been a centre of speculation on the possibility of raising Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents in the open format since Trump took over his assignment.
An assistant asked him if he intended to present himself as a candidate for the presidency.
Warren said it's time that "women go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome."
A person arrested for shooting at Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge Police, La., announced on Saturday that a death suspect was arrested on Friday at the LSU Wade Sims basketball player's shooting.
Baton Rouge's police department has announced the 20-year-old arrest of Dyteon Simpson at the ET press conference at 11:00.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man of the machine.
Yes, 20 years old, he got a shot and died near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot at the head that finally killed him," said police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday to the media for 247 sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got a shot at Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene, in possession of a gun, and had shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Police Department.
Yes, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge played 32 parts with 10 beginnings during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 turns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets the world title after the team's orders gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valteri Bottas stayed in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would have an important role to play in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton while defending his position at the first two times and inviting Vettel to attack his companion.
Vettel went into boxes before and left Hamilton running with traffic to the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop boxing and leave behind Vettel, but Hamilton went after a certain wheeled action that caused the Ferrari pilot to leave the free inner part with the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started at the last row of the grid and at the end of the first time he went to the seventh position on his 21st anniversary.
Next, he continued in a good position much of his career, as he kept his wheels in order to save time, move to Kimi Raikkonen, and move to fourth.
Finally, he entered the boxing about 44, but he could not increase the pace at the next eight times, and Raikkonen was fourth.
It's a difficult day, because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real lord who was told to let me go.
The team did a fantastic job to have a u-do," said Hamilton.
Her body language was terrible
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein on a Saturday meeting to insist that she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused the candidate of sexual abuse by the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's witness before the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "bad, cruel and false".
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate these last days, when you see anger, when you see people angry, angry, cruel, and lying," he said.
"When you look at the comms and the filtrations and say, "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document?
No, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... no, we didn't filter it." She added as she imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the statements against Kavanaugh in Ford in July and it was filtered in September, but Feinstein denied that the filtering process was being carried out in his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to be confidential and I kept it confidential, as he asked me."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the Saturday night meeting: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing with his defense of the candidate in the Supreme Court, accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using statements for their own purpose.
"They are determined to regain power by the means necessary.
You see the evil, the cruelty, they don't care who they do the wrong, who they have to fight for power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the victory of Friday in the Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the game back 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained an advantage of two goals thanks to the completions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equaled the Dundee. Then two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third defeat of the season at the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who just won Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth encounter of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three matches.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in four minutes, at 3:35, from a Kendall McFaul's assistance. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this initial period of agitation, Sullivan repositioned the home team in the game at 13:10 p.m. before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at 15:16 p.m.
Dwyer guaranteed the advantage of the Giants in the first break when he reached the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to its level with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran were combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the first chance during the match at the end of the second and guaranteed the victory of his team with the fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five matches, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next match on Friday.
A dying air controller to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has become a hero after he dies to make sure that a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
Over 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a great earthquake shook the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There are many replicas in the area, and there are many people trapped between the runes in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his seat at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in his seat to make sure that the Batik 6321 flight, which was on the track at that time, could take the flight safely.
Then he left the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died at the hospital later.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"That broke our heart," she added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the rubles and there are still many that could not be accessed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's representative.
The waves, with an avalanche of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a common funeral Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial planes are bringing help and shelters.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the minimums have been taken."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Red Cross is working against clockwork to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still worsen."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?", told the CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini says now that a man has disappeared after the accident in the lake
The airline that operated a plane that was going to be anchored in a Pacific island in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although they previously said that the 47 passengers and the crew had safely evacuated the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that, since Saturday afternoon, they had not found a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday and they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane was stuck in the pit because the track was short.
Some witnesses think the plane passed the track up.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
"That was extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk through the waist water to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and began shouting, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the mariners working nearby to improve a sailboat also helped in the rescue with an inflatable ship to transport the affected people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 metres inside the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a night chronology that burned alive a woman
The prosecutor concluded the case on Saturday at the trial of a man accused of burning alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness of the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to build the 29-year-old movement, Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he was about two weeks ago who knew Chambers when he died.
Telephone records indicated that it was only a week ago that they knew each other.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He erased her from her life," said Hale.
The defense intends to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury during the same day.

Another black person?!
NY Homelander asks a couple for compensation after a "racist" message
A New York mayor reported to a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrong text message from her mother protesting because she was "another black person."
The couple refuse to be racist and compare the demand with an "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed condolences that the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she got to work the first day of 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA OTHER NEGRA person," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to his husband, he sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After learning of her piphya, a "comfort" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nurse who had fired, who was African-American, had done her job badly and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her day of work and then sent her home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice claims to the couple a compensation for the compensation and asks for a compensation of, approximately, 350 USD per day for work with six months' residence for which she was contracted, although there was no contract.
"I want to show you that you can't do things like that," she told the post Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the statements that they were racist at all claiming that Maurice's revenge was the most reasonable, since they were afraid they could not trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent him something that I didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist people," said the husband, Joel Plasco, at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been grilling with, even if it was wrong?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand with an "extortion," said that his wife had two months left to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue something like that?
It's not a very kind attitude," added the investor banker.
The legal case is still unsolved and the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social networks and to condemn their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify themselves with a speaker, according to a new card.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in relation to the letter, "It's hard to get to someone's place that the bed was for the first time before her publication.
It turns out very funny, now that we know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the children's book on a small hair bone, was optimistic about the rejection of the book. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "aggressive", after his death last year.
Describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and office that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptive man," he said.
"But, as Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as when your son got something: you were proud, even if it wasn't your thing.
I think that's how he considered Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always recognized Paddington's own reputation."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, they took their daughter to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that it was very serious and that they didn't expect it to get over it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I went a call from Nad and told me that I would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs they gave her to keep beating her body were consuming and getting out of her system.
He had died before he was supposed to, and that's how everything turned out.
I just had to sit down and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by relatives and more people.
I had to keep my way."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now grieving for her daughter's loss, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted from the experience that was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"He had his head cut and his tears did not stop falling.
It turns out to be hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for Nad gripper.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I wanted her so much."
Grief women pick up cards to prevent suicides at a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have killed themselves are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a galley bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, he was killed.
"I don't want no father or mother to hear what I have to hear every day," he said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, resident in Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could illuminate any room."
However, he abandoned his job before he died because he was at a very dark point.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "because people know that there are people who can go to, who can hear, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her companion for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"Never said he was not well or that he was depressed or anything like that," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we observed a change of attitude.
He played deep on Christmas day, when the children opened their gifts and he looked them in the eyes of nothing."
He said his death was supposed to be a great trauma to them, but they had to work it out: "Open a hole in the family.
It's ruining us.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is holding up for a row while the FBI is starting an investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (a research with an scope and a limited time), we could get some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be destroyed by the death point of the partners.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his partners want to republish an FBI investigation?
His repulsiveness has to do with the moment.
Only five weeks are missing for the mid-term elections on November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans do not get good results, they will be weakened when they get the man who wants to leave the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and press them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, since it was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI believes his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where, at present, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to remove the plague and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea 'cau' deserters with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un reached power seven years ago, according to a South Korea legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Southern Unity, said that 1,127 desertions had occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the price increases that people's trafficking had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Normally, most North deserters are offered the nationality of South Korea.
The sources of Seoul claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers illegal migrant deserters, instead of refugees, and often repatriates them by force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the ongoing negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-one in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to achieve a nuclear-energy free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves the first unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and is not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority of the Nancy Pelosi House said that the candidate in the Superior Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and that his temper is unable to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival, held in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted this way, they would have told her that she was a "historic," Pelosi said in relation to her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied the charges of having sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes shouting and without words while he was talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats and said that the charges against him were a "gross murder and coordinated by a character" organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's witness showed that he could not work at the Supreme Court, since he showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed repetitiveness when they asked him if he was trying to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if he confirmed it, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if you don't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, you're not only able to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where you are now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge in the District District District Appeals Tribunal in Colombia.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could take against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, since it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he asked questions as to whether he would annul certain decisions of the High Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the Court and hope to look wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their powers.
It's a justified Diatra: months and years of plenty of anger and can't take it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's a little common.
He continued, "It helped me a woman who was an executive in some place who said she was also crying when she was angry, but who developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and began to cry, telling the person she was talking to, "Perhaps you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then I went on.
It seemed brilliant to me."
The tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in a masculine majority office, where once I ended up crying with an indescribable anger, is that of a larger woman (a cold directive that had always terrorized me a little) who took me from the cliff and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they'll have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extra-matrimonial adventure in a boat called Monkey Business and he withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," he told me while he was playing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said, "Blancan and the Seven Nanny."
Since he was late in the campaign, he was late with the fundraising, so he promised he wouldn't go to the race if he didn't collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his partners, who gave $1,000 to men, were only willing to give 250 to her.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When he delivered his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of collecting money and to guide the voters, instead of doing it to delegates, and anger, and sexism) that he was left without words.
"You might have thought you had a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the press's reaction.
"They might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking: What will they put on my grave?
"Will you cry?"
How trade war between the US and China can benefit Beijing
The initial savings of the trade war between the US and China were overwhelming, and although the war does not seem to have to end quickly, a distance between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued his first warning in early this year, when he imposed taxes on China's main exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new oranges that affect products worth USD 200,000 million. These oranges assume tax on half of all goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing has been fighting in the same way every time, and recently it has raised the oranges from five to ten percent for $60,000 million in American goods.
China has committed itself to replicating the US, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will be back in the near future.
To make Washington go back is to surrender to some demands, but to bow publicly to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's President.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the witnesses had predicted," says Abigail Grace, a research associate in Asia's Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is "prepared" for returning refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouleem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people who live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mouleem claimed that the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional aid or help from the countries that financed the insurgency.
Europe's selection wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's selection has won the 2018 Ryder Cup in defeating the North American election with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European election again won the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team arrived at 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The North American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, threw the water out into the hole by 3-16, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined on all his series and became one of the four players who achieved 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Speeth was separated by 5&4 by the less qualified player of the European choice Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter, from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
He's a veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 points of career.
"I don't cry, but today I can't avoid it.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have recovered the cup.
The team is the most important... and I'm glad I was able to help," said a excited Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the link to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legend of the North American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost the four parties he had in France and now he has a career record at the 13-21-3 Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics for one of the best players that ever existed, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The North American election fought all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
The North American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after the frustrating performance of his team: "I am proud of these players, they have fought.
This morning has been a moment when we pressed the European election.
We fought.
I'll get my hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Their 12 players have played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
He's got to get his hat off.
They beat us."
