Prague Bag ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions in the ČEZ actions reached approximately half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Bag, at the beginning of Tuesday's trade, reacted immediately to the fall of Monday when it fell about 6%.
The decline of this time is due to the fall of the actions on Wall Street.
The response of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the plan of stabilization of the Secretary of the financial sector is also expressed here.
Action drop in Asia
The shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although during the day the index finally reduced part of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock index during its financial period marked nearly four per cent, although it later reduced its losses by reducing the decline by almost 2.5 per cent.
The index of Hang Seng China Enterprises following the Chinese action movements in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped by 3.8 per cent, and the markets in Shanghai were closed.
Sidney's shares lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses went down to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the Index Secretary came down to 3.6 per cent.
"The ransom actions planned in the United States are unsafe and this affects the financial market of the world," said the Head of the Hong Kong Coin Office Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, independent of the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
American legislators should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt a proposal for support to the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a threat that falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American action
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system support plan to which $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns) should be devoted.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American actions experienced a bloodbath and mainly the rate of action collected the largest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to nearly seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index came down before it was announced, but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal was not coming forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress withdraws: The U.S. government can inject 700 billion dollars in the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial assistance to the American financial system.
Your vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
American legislators broke up discussions on the adoption of the ransom plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 billion crowns).
However, it is not yet earned.
Congressors must amend some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and be voted on.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the Assembly on Monday.
He said on Sunday to the Reuters agency, Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, the "decommissioning" will be achieved through the complex mechanisms which will also achieve market aid in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We resolve our dissatisfaction opinions on how the package of measures for the stabilisation of the market should be held" said Democrat Nancy Pelosiá to Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a final form to the Government Fund.
This should buy from financial corporations unsold mortgage assets that lead financial companies to lasting losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already on it," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis has a strong impact on the fast-paced stock market.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are doing their best to ensure that the Congress will definitely approve an agreement this Sunday.
They want to calm down investors' business in front of the Asian finance market, as these are the ones that are in the first hour and where the Congress could influence Monday's trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote, and not even if they will not be stuck at the last moment with any problem.
The legislators believe that it will be adopted in the next few days.
The law, however, will suffer a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, the Congress could block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the programme did not fulfil its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last 350 billion dollars.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the President may veto this decision, but the Congress may exceed its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme was maintained that it was to earn financial resources for the purchase of bad mortgages whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to end up paying their mortgages.
"We've done everything.
The Assembly of Representatives should be prepared to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of the Saturday and that he values "the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy".
Limitation of the armoured contract
The President of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the programme money for the protection of taxpayers' taxes of their losses, a relief clause of the planned financial plan.
The new law should also limit so-called contracts for directors of the participating companies of the programme, and set up a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This should be addressed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress towards the convention that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson commented.
The plan also has to help homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments it purchases in order to lower the monthly charges on the terms of the debtors and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological assistance
The proposed plan is, according to the Economist Chief of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
"And that's why you don't know what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be bought.
This will be crucial for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week, it is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"A lot more important is that, this week, Congressors agree on their support and give you their good view of everything before it is possible.
This important and psychological agreement that comes to this approval is, at this point, the most important," Marek insisted.
Armed hand struggle: The MP3 Player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems to be clear that it's better to buy just the phone.
There are still enough reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice depends practically on the way in which it is used and the demand for the future owner.
It'll probably be hard to get the most modern toy to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album on it.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as the LP discs are no longer out, and in terms of their quality there is no objective reason to continue to understand them.
If vinyl discs with art rock, jazz or blue music are swallowed in their sheets, it is likely to be dreaming at least with this type of toys.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, i.e. compressed, simplified music - music in MP3.
And here there are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns in a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the market helmets of twenty crowns.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
Also decides the duration of the battery
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even that which doesn't even most of the mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most basic functions such as phone, texting, playing music and video, recording both, having a better or worse camera and even getting to navigate.
And when we consider the smartphone and PDAs, they'll also have a small computer in their pocket.
This is a small miracle because no fridge can make a parillade and no television can take pictures.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
How many more functions are used on the mobile before the display indicator will be lit by requesting to be recharged.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy tragedies.
Few are the mobiles that can play more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) have clearly greater performance.
Therefore, be aware that cheap phones will not reproduce for more than two hours.
In addition to this, above, they constantly call themselves, for more safety, a loader for work - this is also valid for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, as even the worst will last for at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when you write music on your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a part of the devices have the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can connect directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some unrestricted reading units can connect the small memory cards used on the mobiles.
In players, with any exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music through the computer's USB.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the interpreter, album title, gender or also according to the user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with tree structure similar to a Windows Searcher and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
The player tries to use, the mobile knows more
For the selection of a specific team interested in the strength of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its management.
If you listen, above all, the music as a background and you listen to it every day only for a moment, as in the trance, then enough with any cell phone you play.
What really gets any cell phone.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or the player plays the music.
The MP3 reproduces it all and, practically, almost all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most extensive and excepting it the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
At least include the AAC format (format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of online music.
Just through the mobile Internet visit the operator's competent pages (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could only be a weight argument to acquire a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and the majority are limited only to the successful issues of running the radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that precisely this way of selling music (either through GSM, Internet or wireless) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear a cell phone.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find the cell phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends whether you always carry earphones or at least handsfree.
If this is not the case, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile, even if at least one MP3 player.
Probably the greatest advantage for many of the music mobiles will be your price.
The cheapest costs normally less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of an entry for classic headphones.
The best, even with regard to the technical part, such as the phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - really manage them any person.
The minimum functions, their management similar to the previous current tapes or also to the tocadasks are obvious.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that, by mistake, we connect to the Internet with the mobile phone and, consequently, a giant account of data loss.
Which device should be decided upon
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of an appropriate card you will reach the two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped with only a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive ones have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and want to buy another cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to capacity (up to 2 GB) more than 1,100 crowns need not be spent.
If you consider yourself one of the most demanding lovers of free-hand music from the most specialized mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as one of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman mobiles have almost identical use as an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same price category over the four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the most commonly mentioned brand brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, here we still need something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not going to be late.
That the Czech operators are part of the most expensive of Europe, we have already written it in mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed that the Czech Telecommunications Office (CHTU) warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is among the most expensive in the Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming rates, it is likely that a paradoxical situation will arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators sending SMS from abroad will be cheaper than sending them from home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that you really want to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
That is also why the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (CTU), Pavel Dvořák, said that there is no longer room for any other operator in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that for a classic operator with its own network you no longer have too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be hard to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Exactly the virtual operator's entry into the mobile telephony market brought a significant price down at which classical operators should also react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the Britain market, voices like that were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is a place for this type of operators and that they can be successful.
Moreover, there is no need to look for examples too far away.
In February of this year we informed you about the outside of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
Only after a year and a half, this operator obtained more than 100,000 customers and became the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking, the Penta group is located which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is owned by U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is to focus on many more specific target groups.
In addition, for them to function effectively, they are enough with many less customers than a classic operator.
They do not bear relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators are usually profiled with low costs - they offer cheap SMS calls and messages that, however, often conflicts with the offer of more adjusted services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half of the cost of competition.
However, as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland, it can also be a good blow the bet for a non-trivial target group.
This operator is specifically directed to man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - is the operator that likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a concept like that of Poland could get stuck in our country.
Therefore, Vodafone spokesperson Miroslav Čepýk said: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the offer of services, it is relatively satisfied"
There is no possibility in the Czech Republic, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be any virtual operator in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too hopeful.
It is more about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region," said Jana Studnikkova, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, it ensured that current mobile telephone operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined towards this idea.
Instead, they try to do everything possible to avoid any potential competition.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator already shows the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step forward to become a real competition for Telefónica O2 in the company's customers field.
"We have a great interest in this, in order to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephone services but also mobile telephony.
And how much earlier, better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all the Czech mobile phone operators.
With some of them we have managed to move forward at the meetings," said the group spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe they're wasting better times.
It appears that, for non-official information, the first official operator would have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"We now believe that the situation is ideal for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market in comparison with others is a very specific market.
Until now no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this field," said Vlastimil Sršenj, spokesman for Telefónica O2.
The specificity of the Czech market refers to other operators.
The spokesman for T-mobile, Martina Kemrová, in accordance with the opinion of O2, adds: "To date we have not recorded any viable commercial project that can, bilaterally beneficial, continue to develop."
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this point we should already have on the table some specific contract that could be studied in such short horizons."
Vodafone directs its attention to meeting the requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepýk adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this concerns the distribution of expenditure and infrastructure.
We see this as the greatest contribution from the customers' point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on the mobile."
Offices responsible - with lean and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would increase competition which would lead to a lower price and thus to a lower profit.
Then why facilitate entry into competition?
When operators want to get something, they're able to pull out of the same rope, proof of that is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the biggest pressure on ČTU was at the time of U:fono's entry into the T-Mobile company.
This is certified by the public information available on the CTU's website.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: "In addition, it is not long since the competitive environment in the mobile telephony market was opened to a fourth operator.
With regard to the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would be subject to him and, above all, to his great requirements."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging because of the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately does not have any power to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (UOHS).
However, this expressed its typical attitude towards this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after a contract on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile telephony operator and a virtual operator is concluded.
To date, no agreement has been concluded as the offer of the potential interests rather was not sufficiently interesting for the classical operators," added Kristian Chalupa, of the Department of External Relations of the UOHS.
These statements are not surprising to operators' representatives.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, apart from that, they must note that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In the foreign country where virtual operators normally operate, we can observe that their market entry contributed to lower prices for mobile telephony services"
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and the downturn in prices does not come within the interest of the UOHS.
The dramatic shock in all of this is in the dissonant reactions resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence is offered by itself.
It is the same as with the price of petrol in the gas pipelines as it is clear that it is a work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
"The Office in this regard has not found signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore they do not have a corresponding rise in liability in their market operations.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as are telecommunications regulators," Chalupa added.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is obviously a relevant market analysis developed by the CTU that telecommunications is from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge is always necessary the agreement with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all his logic - has the monopoly of his network.
In a specific segment, therefore, it must be dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for ÚOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators are coming up in a similar way.
Current complaints from stakeholders (including GTS Novera) show that many similar obstacles occur in all negotiations with operators.
Loading responsibility in the ČTU is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications, of which UOHS washes hands in all this matter.
We've already met with him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Act for the extension of CTU's competition in the field of commercial tenders that had not taken effect has been introduced recently, even when a number of experts promised that the situation would improve.
This must be fully known by the representatives of UOHS, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one sees
At the same time, unconsciously something as well as a pseudovirtual operator continues to work that in the Czech mobile networks already exist a few.
They are companies that place their own prices on mobile telephony services that, however, are only one part public.
This is usually the case for companies dedicated to multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile telephony services.
Usually only some of these companies get the price list.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same by charging a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile telephony operators prohibit that type of return.
"If cases such as those mentioned could be found to be a breach in the terms of contract which could be translated at the end of the collaboration with the given society," answered Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity carried out by mobile telephony operators will not reach responsible people.
Exactly in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are opposed to this procedure.
With the activities of these companies, they receive no negligible profits and, at the same time, unlike the genuine virtual operators, they do not in any way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepýk warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows for a speculation of this kind, however, the services of this company are used only by a distasteful as many as a hundred customers.
These must also accept that your phone’s SIM card is not your name, so you can’t have it at all as a normal customer of the operators.”
That is exactly what should seem to the least strange ČTU.
In addition, a new question for the ÚOHS will appear.
If mobile telephony operators surround their eyes in this kind of procedure, why do they block the virtual operator's entry?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not to be desired it should not be satisfied with the operator's explanations that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive?
As already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant decline in service prices.
At the same time, in almost all countries where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators tried to protect themselves from this disruption more or less.
The arguments used by these were almost all identical - too small, a market, possibly too saturated, problems with the quality of the service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases have defended operators but their clients.
Both with formal measures or informal pressure, the first virtual operator emerged and with him began to emerge more.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body all this happens as if it were a burning key.
For our experience, we cannot let ourselves be impressed that the confusion of the attributes in these cases suits them.
But we're not going to despair.
If this information is correct between supporters and the virtual operator really reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market is probably starting to move again.
If any of the operators allows any virtual mobile phone operator to enter, it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the refusal (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Czech official celebrations introduced the new official recording of the Hemino Where, my home.
The new anthem recorded the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one male voice and one female voice, one with Coro and another instrumental.
Del canto is responsible for Katerina Kniežinková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this national Czech song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio already said before he deliberately chose the Singers for the Solos with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with the two and then, also with the Coro, which are fixed in the dictionary so that the text is well understood, so that it has consonance," he commented.
The Czech official anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home sounded for the first time in 1834 in the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetan Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
He won popularity and people made him their own.
The first strof of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, part of the official hymn.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The Prague MDD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, it is written in the history of the Prague Transportation Company the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, transit and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at this moment by almost one hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day bonus, 90-day bonus and annually (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time load it on their chip card at the info centres and stations of the transport company at the stations of the Metro, Museum, Můstek, Nadraží Holešovice, Andel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zhrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Bonuses can already be purchased online from yesterday on the transport company's pages, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the Internet as a form of trade can definitely start to forget about the ticket sales positions in the subway stations, where they had to regularly take a ticket to get out.
The bonus is purchased online, and the Opencard card recharges it in one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places the passengers have a window with prepared staff that helps interested people with the purchase of the internet and also with the recharge of the bonus purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrny.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus in the Opencard in the automatic uploading machines located in some of the subway vests.
How are these expanding machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket machine, and the travelers will probably already be placed in them at the stations of the metro of Roztyly, Budějovicka, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are in the city five but at the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrny completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just enter in it the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will only be loaded in it.
Electronic bonds since tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
In other words, on the roundabout trains and bus lines from the 300 to 499 numbers that mainly use the inhabitants of the locations of central Bohemia.
"In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague, there are auditors equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and zone of the bonus," explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization, which sets the schedules for the collective transport of Prague.
Circuit buses have their reading cards mounted in the driver's pocket.
When entering, it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonuses there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not travel on the round buses and do not remember when their bonus validity is over can be sent to the dispensing machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will see information about the validity of your document.
The South East wanted to be part of the United States in a referendum
In 1945 the German Sudettes asked that Fumaba be a part of the United States.
This is what is drawn from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, some German groups of the Sudettes addressed the president of the United States in 1945.
It results from the letters stored in a particular file that are now stored in the Collection of the Bohemian Scientific Library of the South.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask the US president in a letter that does not allow the return of the "Shumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - again to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that the American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed by a "people who carry the destiny of Shumava in their hearts".
Since the union of Czechoslovakia with the south-eastern Germans is presumed - according to this Czech national character - to be a hope only in brutality, neglect, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors pray in the letter to the American president who assumes today and forever to Shumava under protection.
"We cannot believe that, without considering the opinion of four million people, we are being handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that it is fully collaborating with the victory of the allies," the letter writes.
The reason why authors cannot sign is probably the fear of reprisals of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States suspectedly doubted this idea of the Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum on whether their inhabitants want to be part of the United States or live under their patronage.
Despite the fact that the text of the letter, with the knowledge we have today in post-war history, may sound a little childish, according to some experts the expectations of the Germans in the south-east of that time are carefully painted.
Although the Czech Germans should have minimized the fact that they were going to deal with their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate some clear form of autonomy for the Sudets.
Others thought they'd stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
This was in the war, as a German of Budějovice, surrounded by the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war the British rushed him and placed him in the prison camp of Holstein dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought when they came home, the Czech would welcome them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, knew that on the basis of the Orders of Goods would be distant from the Republic.
Don't think - pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most direct action in Czech history towards road safety.
In this way, the emotional Campaign that decided to launch the Ministry of Transport in the media on Wednesday could be characterized.
The minister's office, Aleš Rébíček, promises to deter the drivers of dangerous conduct at the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be heard on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and on brochures.
I'd have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol at the wheel.
And also to remind them that the belts are attached before they are launched.
He wants to come to the attention of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that embitter emotions.
And to that end, the "sanguinary" ad will testify to us throughout the campaign:
Don't think - pay!
The word "don't think" is written with large letters in the matrix.
And there's the word "pays" in a bloodthirsty tank.
This must symbolize that at a time of departure man can come to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to "fear" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Sonian lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be seen.
It promises that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and milk for drivers
"For drivers, the sugar and milk system is valid.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red sachet passes and so saves time.
The latigo is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says Hospital Psychologist Na Homolce, Martin Kořán.
And that is why an information campaign is needed in the press and, above all, a negative publicity, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," warned Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in return for peace
The President of Israel's provisional government, Ehud Olmert, spoke of the restoration of practically all lands occupied in 1967, namely, West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will necessarily have to return almost all lands (occupied) if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"Surely we will stay with a little bit of these lands, but we will have to give the Palestinians one percent similar (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the event of a refund, Jerusalem would also be included in this.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over their feet as he passed to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out in reference to the two July attacks in the city in which several dead and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the mountain of the Temple, a sacred and historic place" within the old city.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate into 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he insisted later.
Removal of the Highs of the Golan
Olmert also spoke of the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Highs, which from his point of view is an inherent condition for a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also entail concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not intend to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to go to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with Hizbula (China Movement), they will have to withdraw from the permanent support that causes Hamas (China Movement), Al Qaeda (Terrorist Network) and Yihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are the hits on the buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
Regarding the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near the Italian city of Padova, the question arises as to whether the passengers and passengers can move by the bus during the trip.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of azafata is opposed to the road traffic law," says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which he died last week the 20-year-old stroke was apparently caused by the truck driver only when the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place of the vehicle despite having reserved two other places.
However, the bus may have an accident or suddenly stop, and at the exact moment when the bite divides the coffee or newspapers.
Here what the role plays is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with standing places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency do not have places to walk, as confirmed by the company's director Radim Janchura, Aktuálně.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, this was withdrawn and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat," he commented.
Azafata doesn't know the law
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the azafata - no legal provision clarifys this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from carrying out any service.
The road transport law only knows the name of the vehicle auditor whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds, less teatively, spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorny, thinks that the law takes sufficient care of this problem.
"It depends whether the bus has the approval allowed to have standing places.
That's all," he says.
The buses are divided between the urban areas, where there are places to be on foot and at maximum speed, interurban with places to be on foot with a greater speed permit and long distances without places to go, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with a safety belt.
As on the plane, the expert says
The safety expert from BESIP in transport, Jaroslav Horín, does not see any major problems with the movement of the azafat on the bus.
"During the development of the journey there is not much danger, the situation can be compared with service on aircraft.
You don't even have the security here that the turbulence comes and that the stroke can be hit on your head."
"However, if the bus suddenly stops clearly the physical laws are valid.
Same as on a city bus or on the tram.
The safety of the trap must solve it by the transporter's internal rules," he says, and he also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unresolved.
Janchura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only transporter who offers the Azafatas service.
He employs two hundred.
The Director, not after the accident, considers this work risky.
"However, at the moment you have the impression that the azafata post is at risk, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, by entering.
It would even save costs," he says.
In the interest of security, it is the reason that Asiana lacks touch on her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, which runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have bites, we've been against them from the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
A Great Tragedy Happened
In the accident of the line connecting to Naples, a young man from Pilsen died who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking car blocking the pass to the bus. without using the intermittents.
His driver tried to avoid it in a fast maneuver, however, he shocked with the right front.
Janchura denies that the two places that are reserved for the rest of the azafata were sold.
"These sites can't be reserved for long distance connections, they're blocked."
The company intends to claim the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the judgment on the compensation of the girl's family, but wait for the financial costs also for the guilty party.
Reform of the law?
No, for now
The reform of the law could lead to a more accurate movement of the azafata on the bus in which for a year now 30 experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working.
"However, they have not reached any concrete conclusion.
They are not too dedicated to the buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile during the march," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the hits to be a major threat to passenger safety," said Portfolio Hanzelka, who concluded that bus security control is the competence of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf's hope is supported in Frankfurt
In the letter from the West LB Board of Directors for their collaborators, there is no shortage of words.
The merger of the Dusseldorf bank units with the DEKA bank can form a central capital market of the financial group of Sparkassen', as it says, published on Monday
The West LB bank, breaking down the ‘competence block’ with sustainable profit capacity, would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger can be a beginning for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
This is how the text comes to be understood when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in difficult times.
Because just like the West LB before, it's under enormous pressure.
Not only the part of the European Union, but also the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services recently made it clear to the Government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For a long time now, also on the part of Frankfurt, much is said about the connection between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know for their investment funds, and West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after a half year to the end of August, said he saw no sense in the bank's merger, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the DEKA Management Board, which is now composed of the regional banks and Sparkassen associations, has commissioned a joint directive to start negotiations with West LB on common commercial activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, as stated in the financial website.
This is not the first time that the name of the DEKA bank appears in the area of consolidation in Sparkassen, which, with its 3,000 employees, is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003, the situation seemed to be such that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Renania-Palatinate and with Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union failed.
Only plans were made public, the government of Hesse expressed itself against the participation of Helaba in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But lastly, Günther Merl, president of the Helaba Board of Directors, expressed his opposition to the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Independent of this seems to be more clear than the need for the union of the different banks in the field of public law.
So when the Bavarian parliament elections are going to take place, the BavarianLB union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For Helaba that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge, Helaba will miss the partners to do so.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although it has so far been much better than the financial crisis that the Stuttgart and Munich buildings have done.
On the other hand, Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, who owns 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided coexistence plans with the West LB.
In any case, only North LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form only one part.
On the other hand, it is the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, that deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband had not given any answers so far.
Finally, West LB can be decomposed, but that, of course, is not the bank's own desire.
Thus, also in the letter of the Bank Board of Directors, it is said that a complete solution would be sought for the whole bank
As the coexistence between individual parts of the bank can be combined with the DEKA, this will show time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "the weekend of Italians"
For Elena is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, Elena watched him as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a barrel of 5 litres of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows almost 200 participants in Octoberfest that low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a palm, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From there, from the parking next to the train station Porta Nuova, tonight at 23:45 three buses, `Munich direction, beer party', expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are intended especially for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking next to their flag are singing the South American, they had already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather fore and glasses with silver slippers, belongs to these buses.
For five years they have come to Octoberfest, considering that there are only three excursions this year.
At night on the road there, during the day on the beach, at 2:30 p.m. the turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made under Bavarian law of purity, sickness insurance and guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the quiet queen on the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the forces.
She goes to Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian registration take another break on the bus 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when Marco's group is scheduled to arrive at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Teresa Prado, there are already about 50 other buses across Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow hat.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to the Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "konscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the campaign shop open, that means marching!", cries Marco in the morning.
"Go!" went and occupied the rear seats in the campaign shop.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and all with yellow hats don't sit in the same bench, divided by all the space!"
A liter of beer, ruge Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Do not forget the propinium
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
Just get out of his place, he'll be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon exactly at ten and a half you have to come here!" Have you understood?
And now everyone goes to Octoberfest.
One, to mark the road, even yellow hats in trees, traffic signs and even in a poster of the elections of a great Popular Party of Bavaria.
You wish to be able to recognize the way back.
It's the second weekend of Octoberfest that is known as "the weekend of Italians"
There are no accurate data on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who travel on the Alps and are storming into the campaign stores, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend in Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Red Cross of Bavaria, which makes a statistics of the present nations, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, take the lead in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and the Austrians.
The favorite Italian campaign shop is called Hofbräzelt.
Nights without sleep for the creditors of the Real Estate Hypo
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, only the Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück stressed last week.
However, that the politician would use the word "relatively" and added that the German banking area would also be affected by critical trends.
And that's what happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich's real estate fund, which is quoted in the DAX index, receives from a consortium of German banks a loan of billions to withstand market turbulence.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well said to Reuters: credit aid amounted to EUR 35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Real Estate Hypo will use must be of interest.
Money comes from private banks also from public law.
The cause of that is the losses of the Deepfa branch.
According to one report, the state finances with the money that was provided for long-term projects financed them only for a short period of time - what is now not as much possible due to market mistrust.
In the first half of the year, the capital reserve of the cash bank has fallen by 95 per cent, EUR 2.37 million, and the equity share has also decreased slightly from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Compared to the same period last year, the continued income of financial investments and net profits of financial operations fell to zero, the debt-to-debt income and some securities securities also dropped by more than 70 per cent, by EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the high and high income of the reimbursement of the compensation costs for the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and the business organized for the companies of the consortium, the negative balance could charge a deficit of approximately 16 per cent more.
After privatization in 1990, the former state financier at first lost himself in speculation with the industrial credits for buildings, which served as a reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
As much money could not be made with the funding of state projects, the Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the area of infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private investors and as well as state (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and was diversified.
Now the Real Estate Hypo has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated loss and profit account of the group, it is said very inaccurate.
It's a fact that the dividends have cancelled.
By 2007, they had been cancelled to two thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa, the Real Estate Hypo became an important State and financial asset in the area of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which has happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans was essentially down because banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year, the Real Estate Hypo needs nearly EUR 50 billion to finance a portion of the Defa credit portfolio of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the report of the Real Estate Hypo Bank, the bank covers with credit the need for the group's financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international monetary markets that are now essentially not fit to operate"
Other sources say that this money guarantees refinancing until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, chairman of the Hypo Real Estate Board, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the monetary markets for the foreseeable period.
The German Central Bank and the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services (BaFin) are based on the fact that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group from now on is assured.
That's what the bank's shareholders and creditors have to wait for.
But because of the dynamics and impedability of the crisis, there is no consensus.
It is even imaginable that there is no need for funding in its full volume.
But the other case cannot be ruled out.
The voice was that in the last Sunday's time the bank was still almost in insolvency, so the temporary rescue cannot be at least calmed.
The price of action fell to 75 per cent, EUR 3.30.
On the contrary, loan courses are really good.
While priority debts almost do not change, the rates of loans according to the position in the property register clearly tend to be lower.
The loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are affected in particular, and the loans the maturity of which expires in 2009.
Following the significant growth in the bank crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Real Estate Hypo, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the issuer banks, governments and banks that are not affected are still ready to support the system, while pensions amortization can be started within the time limit.
Or something's going to happen, which can't be imagined - the financial crisis is going to be over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-reported news about partial stabilization, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That will be a reason, because creditors will spend the night without sleep, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
However, short-term investors can put the end point and use the transport to account for new losses for future payments of interest-reward taxes on future change.
Sylvana and the Secrets of Bent?-Box
When the first day of Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to be present at the Tachibana High School, the girls began to laugh: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges she counts Japan.
"The first day in a college in Japan.
I was nervous.
Before I went to college, I was afraid.
I live on the coast of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I go on a 40-minute train to the Tachibana High School.
I just had to find the way, I was lucky I didn't lose.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not as strict as in my home in Lower Saxony.
At eight o'clock in the morning the students come, at nine or twenty-nine a small meeting begins with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
Moreover, I am not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform, I got an old skirt from my host family's mother and a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, that's how I put it to the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week will be my birthday.
I was very happy at this moment because I had been studying this language for two years now.
All 31 girls in the class have cooked, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my Mangas.
That belongs to Japanese girls' survival vocabulary and means "Mona, beautiful"
Then I went off quickly to my place.
The girl next to her had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really upset.
Everyone talked at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions - at the same time it was very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in recreation they all pulled out their Bentos.
My family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else that boring German pieces of bread.
He had rice with herbs, small sauces, pepper salad and algae, fruit and something like meat in tofu mass.
In most cases I have no idea what it is like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of marined surgeons in the salt, buff!
In Japanese schools sales are not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a very artistic well for a boy and gives it to him in the hope of getting to know him better during a recreation.
That's what I read in my Manga Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always answered:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
Finally for years I have preferred to read Mangas.
In order to understand comics and culture better, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me, it was absolutely certain that one day I was going to travel there.
Also because I have a bottle of tradition and customs.
Here they have a great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, a country that is severe, disciplined and traditional.
As everything is well organized, I still haven't felt lost here, although Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a shark feeling the danger is running away, why is he also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, a neurology scientist, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you control whether they, acting in a manner similar to us, feel the same?
For many years the contributions of famous scientists have been published in an Internet magazine called "Edge".
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else could prove it so far, even though we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown area because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as the other animals: it is killed, fled or attacked.
People behave in a similar way, some scientists conclude on comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to contaminate our subjective experience with animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the frontal lobe of the brain cortex (due to their participation in the short memory and the executive functions that lead to conduct).
This vast part is much more developed in the case of people than that of other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the frontal lobe of the brain cortex, including knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man is different from the other primates.
Another particularity lies in man's linguistic nature: As most of his experience is connected to language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case animals may be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created anyway, in many cases would differ from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, does not be measured because it has the special hardware, nor does it be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during the short memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential thing goes rather to the neutral correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of brain cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what's the result of that for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain that is responsible for it is activated, the same as with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupys a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
Given this point of view, the sensations are very fixed by the brain cortex, which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of the linguistic nature, there are still classifications of the fine feeling because we can differentiate and classify the states with the help of words and grammar to describe the states of others by pair of ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the other hand, thinks that the sensations are derived from simple activities of the parts of the brain cortex responsible for the body's feelings and the brain's trunk, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the brain's trunk.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can absolutely refer to different types and feelings.
For theoretical reasons, I can't go against it, but I don't think it's possible.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like fear, perhaps that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control whether rats and men acting in a similar way feel the same way?
Seeing the danger a cockroach flees, can you be afraid?
I believe that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That is true, the neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, the sharks on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain trunk responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also the sharks (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their feelings are supposedly fundamentally distinguished from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress is expected in the field of neurology while measuring the same of rats and men.
As I don't investigate the language and the conscience of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
It can be said that I don't see beyond my noses, but I prefer to make progress than to work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Ivan Wasjunik, the Deputy Prime Minister, said that preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as proof of Ukraine's confidence in the ability to organize the European Championship together with Poland," Vasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is much to be done in both countries."
The time for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in host countries is short.
The number of stages is likely to be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do work at great speed," said the president of a Ukrainian association Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA won't take our eyes off."
A more radical step was taken in Poland.
After many scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish PZPN association and replaced the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN is unable to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many first-division clubs were condemned because of down-handling to the lower category, finally the division council also had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid counterattack angry
She wanted to promote a new film, talk about private life in an interview and have problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood Meg Ryan's star named her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He's angry and he's fighting.
The late war of the two roses in the former couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for revealing private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story about the failure of a marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his appointment as an unfaithful husband was clear: "This is "unheard how many times Meg tells the story of our relationship in another version," said 54-year-old man to "New York Daily News".
Among other things, it's very "poor" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again "will remember in public the pain and changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is newly married and recently is a twin's dad.
And so it ends with his statements, highlighting: "As my life continues.
I'm happy because I have a wonderful family that's okay."
Flight and hotel ticket prices are dropping
In the first half of 2008, airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, air tickets in Germany were made cheap even up to 50 percent.
Flight tickets and overnight stays at hotels were made cheap again - this is the result of a study by the travel service provider and the financial services provider of American Express.
The company has analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter has found a major change in the second half.
After many years the prices on the hotel market continued to increase, overnight stays in many places were made cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased by 6.9 percent on average.
From April to June prices have already dropped to 3.6 per cent compared last year.
The trends were more perceived in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the reason that "the interests of U.S. tourists in travel have decreased."
The decrease in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger.
In the city of Norway, hotel prices increased to 26.3 per cent and thus hit a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, air ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Due to the increase in prices of kerosene, the travelers of the Economy class had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-distance flights even became more expensive until 29.2 per cent.
From April to June the prices of the airline tickets in the Economy class, compared with the previous quarter, went down by an average of 12.5 percent, but the price changes for Business Class and FirstClass were small.
In Germany, price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9 in the second half to 23.6 per cent.
According to one study, prices for national flights in Germany even decreased by half.
The cause of price change is partly the increase in the fleet economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the travel market with the aircraft, demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies Treaty which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of flights of non-profit distances in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared in failure - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia still does not go out to make the decimal goal.
Kristoff Klein presented very well the forced landing of the player of the national selection Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed by making a goal.
All I wanted to say was by reacting to what happened, you could read it clearly from your lips.
I just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," savage Hermann Rieger at the entrance of the stadium in Hamburg.
Nothing special happened in the catacubs, the rest time ended and most of the guests were back in their seats.
Rieger was almost three decades of physical therapy of HSV, enjoying a very large reputation as one of those who formed part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach sat with his head and raised his fingers in sign of consent.
Cornelius is Martin Jol's brother, the chief coach in Hamburg.
His order was the same: Go, the second goal!
But that wasn't done.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," Marcel Jansen added.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have it "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) for its head impact; and also for the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol summarily.
This Monday, the SV in Hamburg is going to be 121 years old.
The Saturday will be the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stage and the table change on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," said Marcel Jansen.
It provides that the partial qualifications of the table correspond more to the velvety of the league than to the domination of its HSV.
The cock with its players forced late like Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Petric baller as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to join, but the cock can still not shine with his successes.
"We need more than feeling and dribbling," Jol says.
After the defeat of the vote
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the bank's rescue package left the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the loss of the biggest points during one day in your history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
About 20:30 one of the most important stock exchange barometers in the world rated a 5 per cent deficit in 10,579 units.
Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained in 1548 points.
At this point, the biggest loser in the Dow Jones were American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
The shares of the Goldmann Sachs bank lost almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, a big investor Warren Buffet had participated financially in the company.
The rescue plan plans to make available resources to buy so-called "podrid" mortgage actions.
But the sum will be paid by strike but step by step.
As a compensation for this, the state has to receive the receipts of options for actions for financial partnerships that may be charged during the course development to reduce the financial burden of the state cash register.
Action courses in Europe and the USA continue to decline
The aid of billion for banks in Europe and the US does not calm investors.
The course of the actions of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate is low and negatively influenced by Dax.
Despite the rescue of the state-designed financial market, the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the projected actions of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank resulted in the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the rescue actions of the federal government and private banks, Munich's property finance has lost two thirds of its value over 20 per cent, and the Commercial Bank has lost more than two thirds of its value.
The Dax clearly fell below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and contributed a deficit of 3.7 per cent in 5,839 units.
Financial markets have fallen worldwide.
The opening of Wall Street's day in New York began with remarkable losses.
Investors fear that the 700 billion-dollar rescue package of the US government is not enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent until it remained at 10,809,25 points.
The House of Representatives of the United States wanted to vote on the draft of salvation, the vote in the Senate may be the first of October.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: at the beginning the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the main Japanese index of Nikkei after profits fell to 1.26 per cent in 11,743,61 units.
In Hong Kong the Hang-Seng index fell to 2.1 percent until it remained at 18,286,90 points.

Following the announcement of capital expansion, Arcandor's shares were lost in MDax.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the trade and tourism consortium announced that the participation in the Thoms Cook company will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the path of space probes
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused the dissatisfaction of researchers: the Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the manoeuvre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Relativity Theory cannot be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threatening you a death in the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the manoeuvre, causing confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a manoeuvre of the orbit of space probes as they gain acceleration using the energy of the planet's gravitational field, such as Earth.
This allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Sun Ulysses probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: The missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravity.
Better frequency is irregularity of speed.
Suddenly the probes have a higher or lower speed.
The physicists could not explain this effect until now.
It was called anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the manoeuvre.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the General Theory of Albert Einstein's Relativity that describes the force of attraction of the matter by the curve of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, now believes solemnly as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in which the astronomers remained in the universe.
"The reason for anomaly can be the Dark Matter that can also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The researchers of the universe have known the existence of the Dark Matter for only ten years.
It is supposed to possess the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible which means that it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists, the Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed, after ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The kidnappers of the Sudan had demanded millions of ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom have already begun.
Germans always fall back to the point of attention of kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper tells us about the most important cases.
Because European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are free.
The same information is provided by the Egyptian State TV, the Arabic Al-Arab TV broadcaster and the Italian media.
After news of the release in Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, Italian Foreign Minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
"Now we control your health status," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and a sister as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and are in security, inform the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants in the expedition in the desert are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible is the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue," the guard said.
It was only about "reception of the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and two of them detained in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded that Germany save up to six million euros; the money had to deliver the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that liberation was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their security.
According to the report, kidnappers intend to release female hostages after receiving the rescue.
The men had to be arrested until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The Embassy of Germany in Cairo refused to take a stand on this report.
Patriarch abuse "carried to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse for her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Treise, 57 years old from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight counts of innocent assaults.
The Royal Truro Court, through an indagatory study, knew that he had regularly attached his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a paper of confession: "I feel responsible for your death."
The court knew that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her house in Mutley in Plymouth on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Treise used to grab her and sell her eyes before carrying out her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Treise returned to Cornwall.
His daughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Mrs. Randle, who spent most of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had suffered twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said about her, which after being a great surfist and cyclist, now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "refused to life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, found the woman dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that concludes by saying, "I used to grab her and open her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for his victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim leaving his own life.
More clearly, if she had not done so, the question would probably not have ended in the courts."
And he added: "I have noticed the effect that, according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother, abuse was on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that an official of the Cabinet who forgot some secret documents on the train in June would be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on his way to work by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is certainly the least serious burden under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention to commit a crime.
The BBC correspondent for the Frank Gardner Defense said that the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the protection of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official should be accused by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Secret Service Committee.
Forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the capacity of security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then transferred from his house to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of over 80,000 pounds after the rescue/saving of the Bradford and Bingley bank.
The Government, in fact, provided 14 billion pounds of sterling to protect the bank's 2.6 million savings.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies using savings, including 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Building Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers that the companies and their members must pay "humillant"
In any event, the 14 trillion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley's mortgages have been redeemed.
However, the interests that become in the interior are assumed to be charged annually to the 700 financial corporations that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies were included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that acted with caution ... are called on to pay today the price of the institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each company had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and the mediation companies had to pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will rise to 450 thousand pounds in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover 81,000 pounds in order to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Commercial Association of Building Societies, told the BBC that this situation was unfair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that acted prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent."
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the next few weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members against what might be a relevant price," Mr Cole added.
The interest gained in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of required interests, which may be almost twice as much.
As mutual-organization construction companies and without shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interests in their savings.
The price of milk goes up by five pence per litre
The inhabitants of the Jersey road will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra five cents a litre since next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and following investigations carried out by a consulting company.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had increased before February was in 2002.
Renouncing freedom under bail to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladesh court has rejected the request for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be led to prison when she returns to her country.
His advocates said that the court did not grant freedom under bail by accusing him of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various charges of corruption against you.
His long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released under bail early this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's military-supported government grant her full freedom first.
The correspondents say that while he was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is now not clear what the terms of his release are or if he will be able to remain free when he returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers said they would appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request for freedom under bail for Sheikh Hasina, claiming that it could not obtain freedom under bail because it was already being treated abroad under parole," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall bring an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
His advocates argued that she needed freedom under bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after October 17, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provisional government, supported by the army, took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all the charges they are charged with.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan – says the UN – have not been able to take advantage of a recent anti-polyomyelitis vaccination campaign due to the violence of the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that children could not reach Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
One UN spokesman said that despite the promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or blocked thousands of officials while carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge in ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competence Commission after the decision that forced the company to reduce its participation in the rival ITV broadcast.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Appeal that it will have to reduce its participation in ITV below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously said that BSkyB's interests hampered competition and allowed its disloyal influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its package of actions in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, when buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopolis Office reported that the acquisition of ITV participation by BSkyB raised doubts about ITV independence, and encouraged the Competence Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin's boss, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, noted that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was not reasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, said BSkyB, it would have delivered its voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of American lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of the administration officials.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the legislators and the former producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officers questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Great allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from office by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision, suggesting that the lawyers had been dismissed for low performance.
But later it was assumed that lawyers had not been judged worse than other colleagues, and many observers concluded that the dismissals would be justified for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the persecution of Republicans, high profile Congress members, while others had refused to investigate electoral fraud complaints against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government
and can be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under the pressure of the discharges, resigned from his position.
A number of other officials from the Department of Justice did the same.
The General Prosecutor's report is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and underlines how he had a "primarily responsibility" for the dismissed, who "abdicated" his leadership position and was "notably non-cooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former Bush collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Epica de Meat Loaf de honora
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for its epic hero Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special award next week at the ceremony that will take place in London, said that getting this recognition would be "an honor."
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf won in 1977.
The Coldplay group is running the awards for this year's prizes and making the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that exceed time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity such as that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrument section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and became number 15 in the classification.
However, Bat Out Of Hell from Meat Loaf remained in the classifications for about nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later he came up that he had a chest in his vocal string.
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others just serving.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-term local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends to the North of the First Street – before I found the Second Street – between the Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This street, more than 30 feet wide and 120 long, resembles a dusty street more than an active road.
There are no signs.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there's Avalon Bay, the company that recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
who wants to revamp Extra Place and create a clean walk to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the old-date neighbors who commented that they were delighted with the trolled carriage simply because it is one of the last remains of the past of the block before the fitting of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Conservation and Development of the city, which has street control, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Community Committee on the Victims of Land Use this month, representatives of the Avalon Agency drew up a proposal to buy the street.
However, the Committee, preferring the street to stay in the city, asked for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the Community District Manager, said 3.
"The city is very few spaces owned today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," she said.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some for use as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street emerged for the first time during this month's meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it did not necessarily want to own it.
"The primary concern of Avalon Bay is the renewal of this abandoned street and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission was the development of property rather than its management.
Compared to its most colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a trail in history.
Some believe that he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate estate was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opens in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment coming out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"He was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the conquest of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the public goods, even modest ones, must remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, practically without changes, a king of the city that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Complaints: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk about the city's history about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little narrow and unexited street, also dark by the day and marked by doors of an oxidized iron warehouse and counter-ventan, with old weekly newspapers blown along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stood near the door used to enter the CBGB and now receives a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and a bottle of empty beer of about 22-oz were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested that a cleaning could be given.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its present state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet and dry places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in English
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in studies about California and director of Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling the Spanish voters effectively is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "Afro-Americans and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
In order to combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, inter alia, "bilingual transition education" for English students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers instruction in languages other than English, is effective in canceling the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern region of the Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low income:
Over a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are learning English.
However, an incredible 100 per cent of the fourth year students, has been positively evaluated in the 2008 mathematics review
and almost an equally amazing 93 per cent has dominated the English language test and art.
This incredible success has been achieved by using a different ingredient that Mr. Obama favored.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes the review and practice, the constant assessment of competences, and does not tolerate an apology attitude.
In addition, and here is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the headmaster of the Sixth Street, the school's approach to English education for students is in the "total immersion".
Inmersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "We have had extraordinary success with students like this one who has come from Mexico and that, if you entered the classroom 12 months later, you would not be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we believe it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate for other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of its party on the issue of education (the Associations for National Education have long been advocates of bilingual education) and its own constant support for bilingual education obscures Mr. Obama's prediction of the answer.
Although immigrants must learn English, Mr Obama has recently trivialized the issue by leaving people to stop worrying about the legislation that is written only in English.
and instead, he said, "You must make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than ignoring them or trivializing them.
The price of oil falls suddenly after renewed economic fears
The price of oil was drastically reduced this Monday because of the concern that the American ransom plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
The share of crude oil decreased from 7 per cent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning negotiations in New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped from more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had dropped to nearly $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before returning again because of the huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety took over from investors, once again, on Monday, despite the Congress leaders who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that took place in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will purchase the bank operations of the Wachovia Corporation, as the government said this Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the Fortis European financial conglomerate.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, in the frenzy of the weekend, the negotiations leading to the rescue agreement "seem to have been unable to reactivate the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for basic products, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The prospects for global equity, interest rate and exchange will be increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that basic products cannot escape this contamination.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is whether the American virus will spread worldwide and specifically to China. "
The bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, such as low oil consumption due to the economic growth crisis and the forecast for a reduction in the price of oil and gas is 20 per cent by 2009.
Second crazy room: team sets record
After having spent the last eight seasons more than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw things develop in the second room this Sunday, when the Jets turned a party without notation into a disinflation game.
"I've never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
The second room began after the Jets and the Cardinals had played with pear under the shadows of the clouds.
At this time it happened that the quarterback Brett Favre met Laveranus Coles by achieving a target of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect presage for an afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between the players had a great leap forward.
Favre met Coles for two more goals in the room, one of them when one cornererback fell and the other arrived with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," said Favre of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He is a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, no matter what people may think."
While Favre and Cole were in custody, the Cardinals' defense was being abused by Kurt Warner's quarterback.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a moving shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss Warner.
In the last tournament, Bowens' faults could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a final 34-0.
It's the bigger points the Jets never made in a room.
To the team coach, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, he said, "The second room or the third room?"
When both of them were answered - the Jets allowed 21 points without answer in the third room - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second room much more than the third.
They have won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Gebrselasia Rested Head of His World Record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has demonstrated because many consider her the greatest runner in history, surpassing her own world record in Berlin's marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person able to race 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the comfortable race in wool at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has destroyed for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in a race of impressive length and has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the counter-clock race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarming, in retrospect - that air pollution would exacerbate its problems with asthma.
Instead, he set out to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using medium term shorts 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that she had been in trouble two weeks before and that she had lost a week of training.
Clearly, the suspension left him fresh, unoxidated.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told the journalists.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything was fine."
The athlete has been subjected to some criticisms - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Afro-East rival - for the style of orchestrating too much of his careers, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on marks as if it were a race track, and putting records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not decrease the size of Gebrselassie's skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half of the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after his markings decreased.
But just three miles from the target, Gebrselassie took a last impulse to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi arrived in the third place at 2:07:48.
In the women's career, Irina Mikitenko, native to Kazakhstan, but now German citizen, completed a notable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain owns the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also didn't take part in Beijing Games so it was described as a back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and establish her best record in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculation career, leaving a quarter of Kenyan and Ethiopian corridors made of head and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia won second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop from Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and proof of color life
Hidden from the expansion of the park on the theme of the Great Orlando, just a few kilometres from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet village, where pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first completely inhabited by blacks incorporated in the country and place of Zora Neale Hurston's childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 color men, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – also making it a tourist stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the years ‘30, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and doesn't know what's going on."
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to starting a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in the face of foreigners.
"We are very cautious about the way our history is told," said Jones Hortense, 59 years old, a resident of all life and a member of the oldest church in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a triumph and struggle paradox.
At the same time, it is a historical model of black claims and a community of nearly 2,400 people living below a double level of poverty of the national average.
It is a literary centre, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the Black South - sometimes neglected, other praised - that was born of slavery in America.
It's not strange if the residents here are proud and reserved at the same time.
And the concern about Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls you Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the centre of Florida often forgotten to go inside the story of the blacks and the human drama.
Having a face of cement in both life and literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store of property of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road to the left," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well maintained gardens and playgrounds, care for Howard Miller, as he can only read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of widow Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transient rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston puts in relation to Eatonville with the autonomous government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this motherfucker didn't do it.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the girls Johnson who immortalized Mrs. Hurston by quoting men who were singing colourless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77 years old, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did it without prior notice in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts of wearing with dignity.
Most of the residents were fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while many laughed sarcasticly.
"People always rejoiced to see Zora," continues Mr. Franklin.
But she adds, balancing in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabalia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although it was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman in the Barnard College in the '20s, it was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no large commemorative ceremonies, no large public readings.
"I don't think his contribution to the world or his heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
The Orange County officials wanted to put a five-carrying road across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-carrying street of the working community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, inter alia, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mix led to hatred for the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys went through the city pulling oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next to them," said Mr. Franklin.
"They also killed a girl once.
They threw him against a car sandwich."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston wrote the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education, "I insulted instead of honoring my race."
R Residents today say that the disengagement of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of their young people.
"The black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural gap there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped to create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who went through the prejudices, just like she did, with booze, trust and lines like: "How can one deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous grave and began to struggle to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, Mrs. Hurston's famous biography by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookstores, reintroducing it in the American cannons.
The road project came just when Eatonville's most famous daughter was again under the reflectors.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its proposal for a road.
"The resurrected idea of the road five ways, would have been to put in what you would call a bending speed, a true civic pride," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd simply said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the same city.
People from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church from here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new library (with the name Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, about a refurbished and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, you can sometimes feel like on a street of the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 per cent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come looking for the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
An advance permission is necessary to do most of the interviews, and some things - like the walls in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has weakness for the bright red, still fears that her island community may be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, there has also been a higher level of Christmas pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, no better, no worse, and also other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, worker, dumb and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of 18-year-old Mr. Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins in Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, if they dare to go this far, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at your history, it's a very nice city."
This way, in New York, everyone is talking about finances.
On the surface, nothing's changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and giant television screens in Times Square, they would not be aware of being in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass façade of the bee-rooms above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York face daily with the worst "bad day of the office" since 1929.
Boys for delivery to home continue to resonate their metal carts for tea through the edges and carry muffins trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin men continue to drag between buildings of loaded apartments, as well as human mules, with 50 eccentric stamp shirts hanging to a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in queue for their food to be taken from the morning, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
Employees are still waiting for their luggage to be brought to the sellers' carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon in the days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic predictions that exist, I have decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time necessary for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw your cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their cheques, tourists are looking for instructions to go to Macy's big stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "personal trust banker", and they were in charge for the same reason I did.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places where they had switched them, places such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Staten Island.
They had taken their money out of so-called savings associations (a little like a construction company), credit unions and savings boxes from their hometown, whose whites only work within the state of their property, and who say to treat customers as their family.
During the past year, 15 of these banks have failed silently.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion assets, broke in, and as the New Yorkers went to their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was going to seek a ransom buyer.
The workers of the offices and shops that stood before me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe refuge, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Regular people in New York have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her Executive Director, Dick Full, who was concerned about the matter as if they were complaining about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, 50 and something in uniform from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping at the tender.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "now I have all my savings in funds from the monetary market.
Switch is done, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim graves profaned at the time when Austria is approaching the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the extreme right party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgian, affiliated to the extreme right party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities Against Islamization" in Amberes on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signals that represent the mixtures with a red line that passes through.
Police are blaming extreme right-wing extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that the political parties of the right-wing extreme made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in Traun's cemetery, near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, in which the police believe it was an organized action.
The criminals have carved Jewish symbols, such as David's Star on some of the graves, but researchers believe this may have happened in an attempt to hide the real motives of the extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the profanation, which came to the Muslims when Ramadan was about to end.
In the meantime, Austria is preparing for an introspection round after the turn to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties, which accounted for almost 30 per cent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on the anti-immigration campaign and some of its slogans were considered xenophobias by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 per cent of the vote, campaigned against headsets and burkas, and also expressed his opposition to the foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prohibit the construction of mosque and mining, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamic policy in Austria and Europe.
Studies and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Prohibition of travel abroad for Gary Glitter
The courts have forbidden Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, to travel to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the supervisory authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent ' s police made the ban on travelling abroad last Thursday after the judges had produced evidence of previous Glitter convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, a real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Court of Magistrates in Kent, but was represented by counsel Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Judicial Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September, in Ashford's Court of Magistrates in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad such as that of France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad by meeting under the registration of sexual offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to communicate to the police the scheduled date with seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent's police said that they wouldn't discuss the individual case or the possible place to stop Glitter in the county.
One Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do all they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
One Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do all they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the United Kingdom because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks in a more effective way.
"Protecting the people of Kent is the main concern of the Kent police and we work in close collaboration to monitor the behaviour of sexual offenders registered in the county and minimize any risk that may exist for the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied his entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he returned to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Court of Magistrates, in West London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 by possession of images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of Interior reported that Jacques Smith, the Minister of Interior, calmed down and rejoiced to know that they had forbidden Glitter to travel to France and Spain.
"I understand the teacher outside the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No caps, no flyers, no outer garments.
The essence of the great teachers of the flamenco, stripped of the concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, at such moments outside the public, when you find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressity of a hand, neglected because they're not going to go out on stage.
German Günther Bauer alternate in "Flemenco-people" theatricality of some scenes with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of the flamenco from different areas.
Included in the programme of the Flamenca Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of the Flamenco, mostly every day", explains the creator, who explains that "Flemenco-people" "may be anyone but, when you see the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of conveying on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivated by the public.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos from the scene.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to grasp with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With the taste of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer started a long journey in 1,997 to portray the singers, guitarists or dancers with a boardroom.
These are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, remember the classic photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classic base of the image, confirming its modernity, which reflects how Bauer himself understands the flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the action of the dance, song or touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that protects with his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with the essential, with the dune that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the El Fotomata gallery.
Known figures of the flamenco such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, set up this selection of nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits shown in the sample.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Veteran Sports Portraits" ("SportARTProject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flemenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to enter a moment in their life, whether a long or short moment.
I think within the photograph the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself or face people, characters, that sometimes you don't know, or that leave you only a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flemenco-people", is shown in the Gallery El Fotomata, located on the 20th of the street of Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where it can be visited until the next 16th of October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a fear"
It is located in places that still do not know and verse about unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to moving forward the new project in which he works, a novel he has as a protagonist to Roger Casamant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite to the Nobel Prize for Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project he is dealing with "is a fear" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If it were sensible, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I'm hoping to finish it once," he concluded in his intervention at the Festival of Exchange of Thoughts, Thoughts and Words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of Acueducto.
The author of "City and Dogs" was one of the outstanding figures of the third edition of the festival of the word and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award because he was the most voted writer by the participants - an ancient edition of "Our mutual friend", by Dickens-, filled the audience of the theater Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before himself a public who was given a very short time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "placer to read" and "live more than what he lived"; how he wrote of "disciplined manner" to supplement his "inspiration flaw" with an intense documentation work, correcting and repeating much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are supported.
Hispano-American novelist recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more incompatible", so he asked the writers "not to give up on the frivolity" and "to assume responsibility" his vocation.
Climatology marks the Pozoblanco fair, which also remains unrestricted
The festival of districts closing the fee of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended in the morning of yesterday, after checking the announced districts that the square floor was not in the best condition.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Beautiful de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
Meteorological inclusions have ended with this fair, as at last two of their three parties have not been able to celebrate.
The Saturday was the rain that prevented the second scheduled bull race.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a closure of Castilblanco
So, only Friday was a party.
In him, the triumph was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out with his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That very evening, Alejandro Talavante came out with his two ass with greetings and an ear, which gave the tendons more than his tore.
That is, worse still was July, which passed through the thing of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his second bull, after a wave of relief, the bronze of a large part of the audience was won.

His load, more than two tons of hachis, was not like to stop.
The officers pursued and arrested one of the two occupying officers, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., as reported in a communiqué by the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and counterfeiting of a public document.
The incident was recorded when several staff members of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control in N-1, in their passage through the municipal term of Arminón.
They were available to stop a van for their inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, speeded up and control jumped.
The agents began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometres later in the arcene, when their two occupants stopped to flee to the race for a forested area.
The ertzains finally reached one of them and seized the 2.178 kilograms of hachis they carried and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hooky loads, so they moved to police units for a thorough and heavy drug inspection.
In addition, officials verified that the registration had been "doubled" since it did not coincide with the collection in the vehicle documentation, which is why a crime of falsification of public document has also been charged to the detainee.
The Ertzaintza continues with the investigation into the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape the race as mentioned, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The detainee, A. A. J., aged 28, was transferred to police units to carry out the related proceedings and will be brought to court within the next few hours.
Stop the actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effects of any medicine
The actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medicine.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her parking in Montecito, according to the People magazine, a spokesperson for the California road patrol.
The witness has explained that at 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was treading down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to pull the car from the parking forward and back, and going back several times passed over its sunglasses".
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress in the beginning, saw that Locklear stopped at a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned emergency services because "he was concerned about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"He seemed disoriented," so the agents took him to the specialized drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "as the officers observed at first sight, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medicine".
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of any substance that had not been specified and entered the local prison over 19:00, although he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left a treatment clinic in Arizona where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Calls on the Andalusian U.S. Federation to assume its powers in the Silva case
The U.S. Secretary-General and United Left MEP Gaspar Llamazares today assured that it would be the regional federation of training that must take a decision on the case of the former Council of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of conducting family-friendly treatment.
"I am a very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its powers," Callazars said about the action the party must adopt with which it has so far been conceding in the Civilian Consistency.
However, the U.S. leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations on the irregularities that Silva might have done: "IU has always defended that this type of matter has the highest degree of transparency".
In the same line, he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'May Blood', Garci's epic bet
Inspiring at the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci relives the famous rise of the Spaniards against the French in May's blood, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros in the budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried "to illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría in front of a wide list of interpreters.
May blood, with a meter above two and a half hours, is stretched this Friday in the cinema rooms, to become a future ministry for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci assures that he has fulfilled this round "a child's dream", which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who, since the Madrid Community three years ago commissioned him to spin a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2, Madrid, which he accepted at all times and when the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budgets which the Community of Madrid has made in its entirety constitute a "one-stop-shop" for Garci to be able to accommodate with the appropriate decorations and clothing the portrait of "an atolled Spain which was wrong to be the leader for which to fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII" has pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had a funding like that of Alatriste or Los ghosts de Goya - more than twice that of the blood of May - so he has not been able to round some scenes in a script signed by Horacio Valcarcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost all his career.
Therefore, the director of Return to begin, has fallen into what is his usual form of work, the stage with the actors, with which he usually tries before starting the round and with those who don't casting, because he seems "humid" and considers that "part of the director's office is staying at the theatre and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters who match in May's Blood repeat before their camera, as is the case with Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranñaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate to the Oscar on four occasions - of which he won one - Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the blood of May itself, the seven tables of French billing and the finally selected, the blind giraffes, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one to be introduced," he said.
With this movie Garci doesn't expect awards.
"In the beginning you think you're working for dessert, then you realize that you're only working for prosperity, and now you agree to make another movie," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional travel.
Isabel Bayon recovers the essence of the Sevilla dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevilla dancer will honor a Sevilla dancer as well.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Father Catalán (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Mother Andaluza (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and when she was three years old moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in Oriental dances.
He had a passionate life, a pioneer of the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented the free women's movement.
The life of this woman, who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe from between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to count their lives but to collect their spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested to me flamenco sticks.
So, "the dance of the bat" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my dance is also in this aesthetic," he says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: the one by Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he did in the one by "The Open Door"; and with Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with who was his student.
"Matilde makes Tortola great, the character of maturity.
I am happy because I have accepted to act in my work and I feel very honored for that."
The assembly also includes the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who makes the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divine in all their extension, and who always walk in love with them".
The work also includes in some ways the life of this woman, which was developed in such distant places, especially for the time being, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, since she was normally living in London.
"I wanted to remind you because I think it's those women who have a huge influence at a certain time and now no one knows and much less values their work," says Bayón.
The show will begin today at 20.30 a.m. in the Lope theatre in Vega.
The publication of "The Journal of a newly married poet" also closes the Trienio
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Dario de Uni Reincasada Poeta" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Board of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trinio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Literacy Prize and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the House of the Nobel Prize and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That light spot", which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the various Andalusian provinces, is scheduled to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
The Board of Andalusian Culture Council has also acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Dario de Una Reincasado Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "A no-goodness", and gives the idea of the absence of American cinema, and of all America, in front of the impressive idea that Newman has gone.
Look, it cost him an Oscar.
And I've been retired since 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
It's still been a apple for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend," lamented Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
No one was afraid to make a joke or exaggerate.
A father of film and country had died at a particularly dark moment, with fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When it's so hard time and without the power of men and very few beings that admire you, there's no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
I was incarnating for all an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and gained causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his firstborn dead by overdoses to his domestic and organic food brand.
All a gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a suicide food culture.
The expansive wave of the admiration would reach Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that he didn't kill a man but an era.
Another English director, Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing more than the top of his career.
The bad guy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left us a very high list for all," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping the requirement of probability high and having a serious and private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who is trying, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but then was married to Joanne Woodward for 50 years, whom he was faithful when he was probably left with opportunities not to be.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger out of the house, if I have a file inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven, you see the pride that your daughters in the earth match with their fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, single grandfather and dedicated philanthropy," they say.
The imperfect career of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that there are Olympics in Madrid and, after the fall of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race called it, and in my opinion it's been the worst race I've ever been in.
A top of proposals that, from then on, if they took it into account as an evaluation and I would consider, would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go to parts and from the beginning.
Disposals begin with the collection of the backbone, which makes you have to go first.
Which doesn't look bad to me, but if they're already making you go get everything (including the chip to avoid tails in the race).
Not at all.
Here you were just going to pick up your back (first disposit, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only 'S' size for the shirt (second disposit, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Or is it that because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small shirts with less curtains and cheaper?
Well, things like these are a small compared to those of the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the tail is 15 minutes away and, in addition, you have to leave the bag.
It took more than 35 minutes to wait, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as it was to be expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was joined by connotations of popular rebellion and assaulted the tape.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they won't even show up with the right time in the classification, because of the chip they told me that, I imagine, I didn't notice the exit correctly.
Since then, if I was asked about the perfect race, this would not enter my mind.
So I think we'll keep dreaming with a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search recipient (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference Microsoft has shown an advance of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence without much intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move through the company's campus) by listening to what he hears in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a facial recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are doing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group those present according to the groups of conversations.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
Ask him if he's there to visit someone and he tells him he'll take care of him soon.
Everything without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
The company now has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week much has been talked about over a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of commercial garbage shipments, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it's already going to be less.
All a find, considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extract" to Windows.
The change of direction is grateful.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, as well as software.
When Google Chrome went out of the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the hardware and software to be understood.
Do the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but we need to think about the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer has said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People increasingly pay less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer only starts to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half of the applications that come on the system for?
It's less than that.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a little example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft's employees' restrooms in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
In the refreshing machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by default, was also confirmed a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end of 2010, rather than at the end of 2010.
In Microsoft you will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is increasingly computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, is going to pass bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried her on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Capri lit one in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'El Pacino' and is part of the gay muscular parish uniform.
And if we're going to list star appearances, we can go up to the image of that punctured bitumen force that lifted weights in an ambulatory circuit.
In essence, it is no more than the typical male shirt in cotton, ash and without sleeves.
The 'tank', which call the speaking angles, but the Fabulux Marcel de Bruxelles gives way to all the others.
First, because of its reputation - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with the sport because it receives its name, according to legend, by the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'The Marcel' highlights above others by its excellent cotton, by its unisex cut, by its distinctive shield and by the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its tank tops.
Also includes college sweatshirts, back boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Take thought for the comfort underwear.
Although it's a shame to leave them as inner clothes.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mom; I don't care about the candidate"
His enormous appearance with his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is often but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who bear their name.
It has been in Paris in the promotion that Mango is making at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Hot and shy, earns in short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have invented for Mango in this new autumn and winter season, as well as attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honour of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day, but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
My sister and I both love the movie from the 1950s and 1960s; from there we draw many references.
Then, I like to miss a city and watch women dress, combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Ballarina, actress and designer, you're a very polyfacetic woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything is connected and has many links in common.
From childhood I liked my clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to pee in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, from the dancer, I always tried to take care of my dress.
You know that dancers like to make us style for classes and tests, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the dress is when you really find the character.
So everything goes together, that's it, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You haven't been through much since the 30s, have you been in crisis?
What's going on?
I feel better than ever, I like the 30s.
I find that woman is made, has experience and tastes life with less mistakes.
To me, the biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you're a mother or not?
Since then, I know that I'm going to be a mother because I'm asking for it and, in addition, I want to be a young mother; I don't want to lose it.
As for the candidate, I don't care.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with love.
As for the movie, you're hanging out on a number of strangers that you circled last year.
That's what I want them to see the light.
I, who am a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and anxious, all I want for now and of course, can't be.
I want them to stretch out 'The Last Hour' and 'Searching for the tomb of Christ'.
To see what they look like...
A few days ago you started on a pass with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to go on a walker to make a model.
She simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a beneficial show for her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes that we display - I pulled two pieces from our collection for Mango - she was reluctant to raise money for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
They say so many things about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I stay with that part so good that she gets involved.
He asked me to show off for such a noble cause, but if I get to ask for the pin, so too.
For the benefit of women in the third world, what is needed.
Alcoholic reinfectors must install the 'alcohol'
Inside the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcoholism, he must install a system in his vehicle that prevents the start of the brewing vehicle, or if he does not blow up.
The initiative has already been announced last June and is now included in the annual memory of the State Attorney General's Office, which states that it is a pilot project that will last a year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver, so he will also receive a course of road reeducation.
In addition to the Road Safety Directorate General, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for the Safety of Vehicles (FITSA) will participate in the experience.
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of the motorists reported more than once driving drunks takes the car again.
The alcohol would avoid it because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow the abates; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than permitted.
Its cost is more than EUR 1,000 and would run for the penalty.
In this regard, a study carried out in the EU in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce offences by up to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 people every year.
The measure is subject to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address these behaviours before they arise in criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, as legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the necessary reform by criminal means requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial manner, although it has already been experimentally installed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
It is precisely tomorrow that the Congress of Members will vote tomorrow on an initiative by the OSCE which proposes to install this system on school buses, as has been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 17.40 p.m., the time set out in the programme, at the Presidential Hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de Mexico DF landed the Spanish air force aircraft in which the Asturias princes traveled.
The sun was retreating, but its rays were still forced to use the hand as a visa to see the real couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier, I had asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, then you can't go to the airport to load that time... she's from here or so...
- No, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting for the hangar of the airport stuck in the red carpet and a military valley formed by 27 Marine soldiers who interpret the saving of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the Princess, wind-melen, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had told her that in the DF he threatened storm.
They give a smile and a listening ear to the photographers before going to the room where the official committee is waiting.
At the hotel door where they are staying, one of the four majors of the city, a Mexican TV reporter awaits them.
The Best Fashion Award
Perhaps there is no place in the world most appropriate to present a fashion award, that Paris and probably no live designer more exquisite and good live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of the new fashion talents.
It is equipped with a prize of EUR 300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs on Mango's escape in the 54th edition of the Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and almost wept about the emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the signature in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one is in London.
So many events, coupled with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury, made us end up in a luxury dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
Near the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Nati, with his heart broken and making a heart of three, due to his brother's recent death, put on a suit from the house and a few addresses from ELAH, who cut the breath, and his son Luis's arm - a cannon of nearly two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the chairmanship of his honorary dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is such a gentleman that he ended up with Rotchil baron, without a jacket, because they had been lent to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the shop with his pants and shirt - of his own design - and for dinner she turned into a long black sexy dress, was excited when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet test room and she, remembering other times, got caught up in one of the bars and made a hide of 'large floor'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for a walk through the palace, but he taught us pictures on his son's mobile phone.
The next morning, we were able to enjoy the sight with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another cannon that moves by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously requested, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there's life.
1001, the number of anti-stresses
There are no 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frenzy of everyday life.
And if it is small, they are all gathered in a book that will bring relief to the bookstores on September 30th.
The awakener almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 o'clock in the morning, but it's even worse to imagine being wrapped in the agitated rhythm that imposes the present life.
The office is called tension and the back pain computer.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection with the working world.
No, the number goes up, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a book all a 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each one.
The work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone thinks it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denouncing such a belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the sofa, disconnect the mind and concentrate on reading.
Speaking of sleeping
Some children talk at night.
I don't mean these people who wake up very slowly telling us something that's happened the other day, but children who talk are sleeping.
The first time that happens to the best you take a breath, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a benign change in the dream that's called dreaming.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one has been told that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadicly (once in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the child remembers nothing the next day.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They often relate to other changes in the sleep as often as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (to sleep on floor) or sonambulism, but it doesn't have to be that way.
As we have mentioned earlier, you can also go to very high fever frames, stress situations, or overexcitement.
Anyway, it's a little bit of a studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
You may speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a whisper or everything else (grunts, lightnings, long speeches...).
In cases where the event is very intense, it is appropriate to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check whether there is any question that is causing much anxiety and gives him a way out.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, so it has no treatment, except that it is associated with another alteration of the dream that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress table).
What you can do is take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that are afraid or a little violent.
With very nervous children and which costs them a lot to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will help the child to have a quieter dream.
Once the dreams appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day you won't remember anything about what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not conscious, and you'll break his dream.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you show a lot of anxiety during several episodes, you should consult or find out what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what you say (which is not the most common), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate you for information.
You won't get anything, because when you're asleep, you're not aware of how to organize your thoughts.
Moreover, you will hear what you say, but you do not know what you are dreaming to say that, with which much care in how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
You never tell the kid that you can ask him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That creates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
They're going to end up!
The football club, Illhaeusen, finally found the way to victory in his field after a long period of poverty.
Without having made a good match, the team created many goals and was able to make a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very constant during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to tear the squad with a shot away, Illhaeusern quaasi was going to take the "power" and for the Fonderflick turn away, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we didn't let the downtown camper pass and left only Riahi in the attack position.
The principle of the second time was crucial, first with two times of goal of Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhausiens with the goal of Marais, well located to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt of Diebold (53 ').
But Illhausiens can't enjoy their happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the warehouses a dozen minutes later and leave their teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven illhausiens who went back a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after an important fart, the balloon passed very close to the transversal field.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before departing to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will run around Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance by fishermen who had been deeply disturbed last Monday by the entry of several British and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère last Tuesday to meet his representatives there.
They promised to receive it " with a constructive spirit " and hope that " it will come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general board of the " crisis committee " established by British fishermen in order to achieve measures against the increase in oil prices, which marks a record when reaching EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the spokesman for Elíseo David Martinon, the president " will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to be competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and pay for sailors " .
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand firm.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to improve the movement in Morbihan and Calvados, which have resulted in seizures of almost 10 km.
The sport port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
" A filter barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors had already shown their determination on Monday by burning, at dawn the alba, pneumatics and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks in the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and of the Mancha, as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the boats remained in the port, or in Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of trade ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loira-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the major Donges total refinery.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until this Wednesday's meeting, which will take place in the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " fishermen did not leave " and " do not want to move to Paris " , for example, announced Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on petrol, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance of a ship can be reached only with a gas oil at a price of less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two men and a destiny " has died of cancer at 83 years of age at home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also greeted the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian airline company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite threats of recession in the world economy.
The world's fourth aeronautical builder, Embraer, maintains his delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 equipment delivered, Embraer's president, Fredrico Fleury Curado, confirmed.
During the first half, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer trusts a lot in the Chinese market particularly to sell the planes that go from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 appliances to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would like to sell more than 15 % of its assets
The American International Group, which has been taken away from the US monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15 per cent of its assets in order to repay its loan of $85 billion, according to the Financial Times Sunday.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and its retirement insurance in the United States, which is specified in this journal.
The Board of Directors of AIG met last Sunday afternoon to consider possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to be separated include its Air Leasing Branch, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer, as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been taken on these sales, prosecute the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly implement liquidity to repay its loan of 85 billion granted by the Federal Reserve to the US authorities to take 80 % of its capital, diluting it with the appropriate proportion of the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Bag
The New York Stock Exchange charged a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives had rejected the Paulson plan to save banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 per cent, or a loss seen in the Stock Exchange of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq lost 9.14 per cent.
The industrial index Dow Jones fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, or the day when the exchange began again after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, a technologically dominant, returned 1,983,73 points to 1,983,73 points and the enlarging index (extended) Standard & Poor's 500 to 8,81% (i.e. 106,85 points), to 1,106,55 points, according to the final figures of the closure.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed a little stability to be recovered in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied the Secretary of the United States Treasury Henry Paulson the means he was asking for.
About two Republicans of each three rejected their plan.
" That is not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of the FTN Financial.
"This shows to what extent the market was counting on this plan," added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would come "too late".
"If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take the lead (the US central bank, the N. of the Network) in managing the crisis, which would make credit conditions more difficult," warned Brian Bethune, Head of Economics and Finance of the Global Insight.
And stressing the sense of urgency, " every day that passes is announced the fall of a financial institution " in the United States, Mrs. Piegza stressed.
After the collapse of Washington Mutual last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, resulting in emergency interventions in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing "not only a crisis in the US but a global crisis", the Financial FTN analyst added.
The compulsory market went up dramatically.
10-year-old treasure bonus returns 3,632 per cent, against 3,827 per cent on Friday afternoon, and 30-year-old bonus 4,161 per cent, against 4,357 per cent on Tuesday.
Obama, winner during the first duel
At the first discussion of Friday between the two candidates in the White House, another event took place to find out who had won between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
No surprise, the republican and democratic generals proclaimed their own victory on this television duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "bright enough" to allow him to stop his downfall in the polls for five weeks of presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday, awards five points of advantage for Obama (49% versus 44% for McCain), judges that it is the democrat who went well.
Among the undecided voters, who count, Obama won 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them won McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his own candidate, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
" It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He's got good instincts, but I'm preventing Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, highlighting the "ingenuity" of his opponent on these issues that were in the heart of this first miscarriage.
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... he accused several times.
" I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president " , he also assured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertising.
Obama stressed that it represented the future.
Unconcerned, it became clear and accurate.
He highlighted his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so, " this weekend, a democratic television advertising that reproached the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on the United States " .
" During the nine minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama reported yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for a North Carolina election meeting under a rainy rain.
He did not pronounce the words "media class" or "workers". "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most capable of saving the economy that is on the edge of the precipitation.
"The next week could be a decisive episode," he estimated, yesterday, the influential and democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's " good economic instincts " to Bill Clinton's during the financial crisis in 1998.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the end result of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain " .
Reaffirming that it would come despite all the reduction in US taxes of 95 per cent despite Wall Street's surpluses, the Illinois senator also noted that the realization of any energy independence in the country through the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a 45 power park from here in 2030.
Prudentes, the two candidates made a mistake on the financial savings plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) adopted yesterday afternoon by the Congress and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents protested last Sunday afternoon in the main square of Belarusian capital in order to anticipate the results of the legislators.
Hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon from the closing of the electoral centres in central square Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to protest against President Alexandre Loukachenko's power: "the dictator, he must resign."
Some admit that they have not voted: "Why, because they will do what they want with my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has put foreign observers in a good position in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean for observers.
They didn't follow the opposition.
" We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the vote count " , Iouri Potemkine, the spokesperson of the Union of Democratic Forces, regretted a heterogeneous regroup of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change, underscores Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house is the executive power.
If some Members of the opposition enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
" But your entrance to parliament can mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. "
The opposition must therefore become a political issue because "the dialogue with the European Union needs to start.
Because if our economy, which has many debts against Russia, is in crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectionist of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the participation figures appeared to be too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) promoted manipulations.
" Have you noticed the elections? Ask the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be up to five Members of the opposition to Parliament, who are better suited to power. "
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday its 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained the public's confidence that he had been seriously tainted by the scandal of blood contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer occur.
While Judge Krever was delaying his relationship, certain provinces then set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this mission.
As a result of the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, nearly 38 per cent of the people still trusted in the blood system in Quebec, Décary recalled.
The situation was discouraging.
After much effort has been made to improve the safety of blood products and much work during the years that followed, we have regained public confidence ", he says before proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that " confidence is extremely fragile " .
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we attended in Europe the birth of many cases of the human variant of the loca cow's disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, says Decary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we support one of the main recommendations of Krever and Gélineau's reports, according to which when we do not know it and when a serious illness can emanate from it, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of those who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But a few years ago, it has been shown beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nuclear acid tests that allow donors to directly detect the presence of the virus and not the presence of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
Nuclear acid tests have allowed the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period for less than a week.
We have thus substantially reduced the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one person every 12 million is at risk of receiving blood contaminated by HIV.
"This means that you will have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected by HIV.
Thus, since Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, more than 24 years will pass before a case of HIV transmission occurs for a blood product.
I think it is possible to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion today to recover health without concern," says Hema-Quebec's head of management.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
It's never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, for example, the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies before it is stressed that, in addition to a safe supply, it must be constantly vigilant ", Dr. Decary.
" The needs increase because the population is ageing.
Since more aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often require injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors that, on average, regroup only 3 per cent of Quebecis eligible for blood donation. "
All persons with good health, aged 18 and who meet the eligibility criteria may, however, give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel in a country where malaria is ruled, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we have managed to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Poverty is very rare.
But there is a need to renew the members of this donor network as they age and cannot give their blood any more.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to hold them and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since the present life is very unbridled, we rarely find time to spend an hour to give his blood," laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone inerts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that are almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was previously considered as biomedical waste is full of a rich blood of mother cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
" We celebrated a few weeks ago, placing it in the bank of our thousandth blood sample of the umbilical cord and is expected to extract more than a thousand of these per year.
We should begin to propose it for injections at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Decary, who describes this blood supply program as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this " since Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact on semifinals
The Montreal Impact was qualified for semi-finals of the elimination series of the first USL division, thanks to a win of 3-1 (4-3 in summary) at the coast of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive party of the final series, at the Saputo Stadium.
Centrist Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a goal on either side, Central Camper David Texto and Rocco Plancentino created many times a goal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who kicked Matt Jordan off by the Sounders.
We remember that during the first round of the series of games, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the Seattle suburb.
The impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in semi-final.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, Thunder lost 3-1 in the back game to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless entered the semifinals for 5-4.
The impact should be faced by the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
Soon – The victorious goal of Kovalev
The third number of Canadians is ready to start the season.
Alex Kovalev, Thomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn's compound unit animated the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win on the free-shooting barrier against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star in the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the Tricolor room in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal.
"I am still not ready, I prevent the Russian.
"I need another party to feel comfortable."
He tried to play the most in the first time, notes Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation."
Charest is occupied by the North
The prime minister does not exclude the holding of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general advice of the Liberal Party is completed, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected during today's partial election.
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern border ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while staying on the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric embassies, mining, of Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means such as during the election period.
The Prime Minister thinks that the elections will take place this autumn, although he made it clear that his time was very full.
The " North Plan " is the fourth side of a " vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, the " new economic space " , which includes an agreement on the hand of work with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, was limited to explaining why the North was " a jewel to the immense potential " but did not give a term, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
What could be more developed above all are: in particular hydroelectricity, forest, but above all the mining sector, affected by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, five, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond " , according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as large as France " is our home, it is in Quebec.
It's not just our home, but it's in us," he insisted, as to show that he was asking for a national founder myth.
Quebec was built thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the laugh towards gold in Abitib, the Quebec engineering, the Bay of James.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added, after having taken a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line in which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion is presented, I repeat that position by the government ", he indicated.
In addition, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the north-west passage, which will be opened every year due to the operation of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former member of the Quebec Party of Ungava), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, where Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role started some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting where " a common vision " will be given.
The development of the North would be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concerted, ordered and respectful of the environment " , he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is continuing with that of the first liberal ministers who preceded him.
" Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring topics at the end of the week, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival in the party's power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rebuild the Central Beauharnois in Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
" From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage, who made the revolution quiet and nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Burrassa, who made the Bay of James our party supposed to build the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he called on another reference, that conservative, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the theme of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric embalming project, Mr. Charest stressed that his deployment was scheduled for 2012.
"This is between us, but I intend to be there," he confided to his militants, raising applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and no doubt not in 2009, did not reject the possibility of putting a vote this autumn, which the law allows.
It underlines that its schedule is nevertheless full, particularly due to a mission of the Federation Council in China and a summit of Quebec-New York.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problems accepting: the Quebec Liberal Party in particular called for recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wished that Quebec should name members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and that they had a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcome the great lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
The leader of the Quebec Party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the development policy in the North of Quebec that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, reaching power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If I had, "we would have made progress today," said Mrs. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote today), Françoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what you wish, is that this is not just a show," said leader Sebastian Proulx, in substitution for Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonest Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (ironity!) in Harper's office, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "honor" for Canada.
To shame this woman who has taken an incessant struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration for what she says about the relationship of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national that is locked in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not in any way take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that he was recruited occurred.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and lets a child-soldier live in inhuman conditions.
The only person who has a false justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
We recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to benefit from an equitable process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exacerbations.
We still do not realize that, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and which has no meaning.
The time has come for no morals to exist: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprisonment a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far as he wants to (what will happen after October 14 ?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtud, the Law and the Order: it does not see that this government gave up what was doing the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews' shame is caused by this resignation and by nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In his edition of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President and Director of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest aurifer company in the world attempted a six million-euro defamation process against three authors and a small editorial house in order to provoke a " transparent public debate " .
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation persecution, but the law.
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the dispute is of little importance, the authors and editor of the book Noir Canada should spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defence and fight, with very uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the nearly bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, often consist of ruining the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will stifle the opposition as well as frighten anyone to re-examine the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in a number of countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually conducted by change of ideas and not by strokes.
It was enough, therefore, for the mine to open its books, records and establish a real debate through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and reject requests and supporting letters for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr Garver possibly explain how he can ask for a "public" debate by ignoring his views?
According to the Vice-President, this word seems to designate only highly paid lawyers and not all Canadians; it represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and the editors of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal way of the mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but having as a basis civilized change of arguments, and not in the context of what many people perceive as a persecution-mortality (following the " public debate " , Barrick Gold has just filed a requirement regarding the authors of Noir Canada urging them to no longer use this word).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university and truth, essential by all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations, which represent the basis for intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under the threat of many persecution, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long been able to manage the debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's unbiased persecution clearly shows that, contrary to his wishes, he does not want to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for Governments to place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agreed
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, at the same time Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic saving plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$ 700 billion plan, which aims to halt the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months, still needs to be confirmed by both Congress Chambers.
It provides, in particular, for better control by the electors of their implementation, for new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the invested public money, for new provisions to contain the number of houses in charge of the lack of payment, as well as for a duty to monitor the salaries paid to the directors of the companies in question.
The US Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
" We have made great progress with a view to an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
" Everything has been done to cover the ordinary economy and Americans in front of the current Wall Street crisis," the Democrats explained.
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, trauma, chaos and disturbances on the daily life of the Americans will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they were afraid of the effect that would lead to a new failure in the mood of investors.
The last time they set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the US presidential elections, who have joined the negotiations late, were more favourable to the agreement, but did not forget to express their discontent about being forced to reach this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has been entrusted with certain provisions to reach agreement, in particular which would allow owners to keep their home and the salary of the heads of the State-survivor companies.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibleness of some, there is no need to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, asked another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
"The important points I have read [show] that it is something we will have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
He said that the option of not doing anything is not acceptable."
The 700 billion-dollar plan aims to buy, with the taxpayers' money, suspicious debts, assets to the risks and incompensables of the US financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the sinking of risk mortgages before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (CCAA) and causing a freezing of liquidity and a discharge from banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republican electors who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have left the detention since the Democrats agreed that certain "toxic" assets of the companies in difficulty are only guaranteed by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to clear the aspirations for everyone at Congress, we also added a provision that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which 100 million other million can be added if the President seems to be needed.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by the Congress.
In exchange for your help, Washington will get participation in the relief companies that will be divided in case of profits and that will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the embargo procedures concerning housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The plan's architects would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives since today and to the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, it is not yet certain that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest against this project yesterday, both by Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the chamber finance commission, told his voters that "with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand."
" We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not what it is to benefit the taxpayers " .
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is encouraging a small group at Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
" Four hundred professors of economics, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to say: we ask Congress not to hurry and carefully examine the path to be taken," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas indicated that it had refused to buy its competitor in failure since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) during the crisis of real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
Instead, we regain a voting right in the bank and influence.
It's just something that the saviors and the families will appreciate now that the times are uncertain."
During this time, on the other hand, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would be responsible for all outstanding loans in the Bradford and Bringley bank and more than EUR 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
Did the American actor with a lovely smile ever get rid of her narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
Their smile, their sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have removed him from the register of power that have the true sacred monsters.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at 83 years old, because of lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the latest American cinema icons of the past few years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, who seemed much and was long considered a rival in the film, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of the freedom and exploding of the dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes magnificent children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
One of these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No unscrupulous ego, last quality brand.
Because in it was projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the combatant of the Pacific war, wounded in battle, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, television and soon in the film.
This man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who was classified in second place at the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a six symbol, although a model couple member formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward.
It also disappears with him the secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the world of the show that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman caused the vertigo to the filmmakers this weekend, while their big roles were intertwined on the black screen of the memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual shift shows through it.
Many memories come back to memory as the cow-boy with the charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Cata on the adapted zinc roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we appeal to your sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone to film history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, a criminal, tortured, violent, unforgivable at Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, repeated after his death, who actually launched Newman in 1956.
This cute eater in the beautiful film The Sting (El Ballpe), Oscar at the best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billing player in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), will repeat the character in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, who valued his only Oscar among nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
The times change during your career.
Young people know him especially thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a hockey team on little orthodox ice.
His fans saw him again in 1994 at the Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a last role as patron of the Irish mafia in the Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the rice was removed.
Contrary to several film legends that left the race quite soon, Newman stayed much in the world of the movie, denouncing Hollywood, his gold, his fasts and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge that lives in " underplaying " and that judges his performances too well supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he less often interpreted the role of young gallan than marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, cabrons or desperate, whose features reflected rebellions.
As a performer, Newman later revealed his true pudic sensitivity not very well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the main role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott due to overdoses dedicated his movie Harry and Son in 1984, a work of laughter and sadness.
" Among the many tributes that were set up yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former weapon partner Robert Redford (they had worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, deeply grieved: " My life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other hand, on the other hand, his legendary career is also hidden a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protest against Hollywood's excesses.
We'll have seen a lot of his face reign over the bottles of vinegar sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, though it started as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to your Childhood Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than satisfy his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
In summary, a model citizen.
What were they producing in the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on 8 October, the criminal trial against János Zuschlag and his colleagues will begin.
He accused the politician and his colleagues of committing significant damage, in a business manner, continuously and in an organized manner, in addition to other crimes, including the counterfeiting of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, funds obtained in public tenders were used for their own purposes, justifying, on many occasions, the performance of tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and the city councils - in total about 65 million HUF - stopped in part in the treasury of the Fiatal Balldal organization and in part in the pocket of individuals.
The method, which was also known by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different associations never fulfilled their commitments.
According to the charge, most invoices were false.
To this end they obtained the talonaries in the Józsefvaros district market and the circular stamps were manufactured in the city of Kisunalas.
And the question of which company the counterfeit bill was to be made on behalf of was decided amongst others on that tour by the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent to István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he should choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for invoices for their consumption and they served as a model for the invoices that were presented to each other in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the Capital City.
These invoices were signed in most of them by István Lados and his colleague András Õri, who, according to our information, wrote the reports needed to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his "studies" later he chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his colleagues, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the manager of the center - many people do not belong at the same time in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb JövŞért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évesredert - was full of formal and contextual errors.
As a hostel in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however in the bill there were a hundred and thirty people.
But manufacturers of big fantasy invoices also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. Because in the possession of books of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor - there were no documents on behalf of Job Jöv·ért and of Hoppá.
The company's manager, Gygz, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor and showed him the invoices, he knew it was fake documents.
"In the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that hundreds of people were accommodated according to the bill, as they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people are included.
In addition, food was also included in the bill, while the restaurant has long been out of operation.
Enthusiast invoice manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency elected in Budapest organizes exclusively travel abroad, so that in the cash bill they pointed out as service a trip within Hungary, which did not coincide with the agency's billing practice.
In addition, as was known during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, although travel outside the territory of the European Union was exempt from taxes.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jöv·ért Foundation, since the services of that company were not charged with 25 but only 15 per cent of VAT, and the hotel employees only extended invoices made to the machine, however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "sendors" made other errors as well, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as a road transport activity, which is known during the investigations of the prosecution, does not conduct the company established as an investment consultant.
Equally by formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp is supposed to be the invoices sent to Együtt to Harmadik Évesredért Alapítvány, to XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and to Biztos Pont.
Just as in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehert Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue such invoices.
The falsifiers also failed to note that when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation process, that is why the liquidator - according to our information - refused to have issued such a document.
The invoices were sent out consciously
Another group of fake invoice manufacturers is made up of those who were aware that they should send fictional invoices.
The Esély Budapest Alapitván Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Balldal - Ifju Socialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évesredert.
Collab Kft manager. - According to the charge, one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, convinced him to send fictional invoices.
Similarly, he collaborated with Zuschlag and his colleagues the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 provided invoices of about five million HUF to the Job Jöv ért Alapitvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenny â Egyesület Association, without real economic activity behind.
There was no movement of capital either, as they then cancelled the invoices prepared but forgot to make a statement in their documents to this entity.
The following group of false invoice manufacturers includes those who have any connection with the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with a fictitious headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices for a value of approximately 18 million HUF in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of IT.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kisunalas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also sent documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the company for the Atlas, for the Hoppa and for Együtt to Harmadik Évesredert Alapitvány by charging the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian Albanians at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because, according to the accused, they did not receive employment.
But he took advantage of these companies, as at the request of his colleague, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of companies for the Zuschlag-related organizations: for the Atlas and for the Y-Generation.
Kubatov, on behalf of the Cash Investment, the Delta Trió, the Fa-Bani Jos, the Jos Investment and the Linaxtrade, gave a total of 15 invoices to various entities for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The Prosecutor considered Kubatov to receive VAT and 10% of the amount of invoices.
This man even took advantage of Szi-Beri's company to send fictional invoices used in the Biztos Pont competition.
The Y-Generation and Sövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in January 2006 to Tancsics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the competition.
To prevent this from being discovered, they presented to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Kft Works Team.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office held by Arpád Kemcsei at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the accused will probably report in court - as they did in the Prosecutor's Office - the course of falsification of invoices.
The most interesting thing can be the confession of the chief accused János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
As his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so far.
The question is: What interest does it have?, because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - 50 million HUF - the Socialists have reached an agreement with him so that Zusi will assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could be offended, since in order to relieve his prison conditions, he applied for house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous authors of very high-value economic crimes, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least wait in their own home, he has no chance of that.
Psychology of overlaps: Why do we spend more money?
Participants in auctions are willing to spend more money and overestimate the product.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York discovered the neurological bases - economics of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in Science magazine, people don't want to lose out on competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists have tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental substations.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in a auction, and while it was being examined through the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI) the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games the participants could earn money, but during the auctions, where it is essential to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called strata located below the brain cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "auto prize" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention against causing an intense reaction to the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups have bet against one person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members were betting.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more prize.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly 15 dollars before the auction, but in the event of the loss of the auction, the members of the group lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, checking the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group playing "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be deducted from any previously existing economic theory.
Because those so far explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that we now come to a third explanation" - established Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York Economics.
Hepatitis: When should you go to your doctor?
In the world some 50 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated to be 100 000, but only seven thousand are treated because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by the virus.
Symptoms appear to be very much; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogen agent, are spread through two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g., contaminated water or food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body humour (sperm, vaginal humour, saliva).
It is recommended that travellers be protected by a vaccine against the A and B virus, no vaccine against the C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after eating the infected food, it is manifested by a general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this appear in the skin and in the white of the eyes the jaundice, the excrement becomes clear, the urine of dark color and the healing can last even for two to three weeks.
Each year one million people die from cancer in the world and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that, according to the calculations, only one in ten infected people receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most contaminants do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys the liver cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Early recognition, systematic medical control, is therefore very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
There are currently some 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can also be detected with routine laboratory control, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease has healing if it is detected in time, it is possible to eradicate the virus from the body, so it can eliminate the infection and prevent cancer.
On 30 September, it was the World Day of Hepatitis, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and to the importance of their early recognition.
Does it hurt less those who believe in God?
According to a recent study, religious faith has a calming effect that also alleviated the death of martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed how religious belief influences human pain - reported the British Telegraph newspaper.
As part of this unique experiment, electrical shock was applied to 12 Catholic believers and to the same number of atheists, while everyone was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scan technique, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the various departments of the University also participate alongside academics.
The analysis took place the following way; they set up a spraying instrument at the left hand of the patient, which applied the electrical shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at it in two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of the 17th century Sassoferrat and the Lady of the armion of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the Virgin Mary's show would produce a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while choosing Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a calming effect.
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electrical shocks in four successive parts during that period while observing the painting of a religious theme or the other.
Catholics claimed that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt "security" as "protected" people, "satisfying themselves, and in their hearts peace reigned."
When observing the religious theme, they felt 12 per cent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such impressive image you can achieve a similar effect with the atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person who feels very positive, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases should really change our personality" - added Wright.
After these terrible results, there remains one question: What effect would it have on the pain control if the Lady of Leonardo or another painter of her size were shown to the faithful?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary throw even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
In its tenth birthday Google can claim: you can find it both in the people's pocket, and in the sky above their head; you know where their vacations were, what doctors visit and what they care about.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is not yet enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel to the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to gather as many personal data as possible on its users, and this is necessary to be able to meet the original goals of Google founders: "We gather in a system all the information of the world!".
According to Google’s leader, the company even after ten years of work that returned to the World is still in the initial phase of the effort to process all the information.
To the question that is going to happen within five years Schmidt answered like this: would you like Google to be able to answer questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the best work I would like to do?" - however, software will not be able to answer questions that seem so simple while there is not enough information for users.
Not all netizens are aware that, during their online browsing, the search keywords, IP addresses and pages are accurately stored when the search was completed.
For example, thanks to Personalized Search that started two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-examine what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic the Recommendations will be based on which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are worried about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases the potential represented by the company is what can be fearsome and not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already confirmed that they not only retain, but in justified cases also give third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information of its website, called Orkut, to identify the pedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens concerned about the rights of individuals were relieved in May when the company together with the EFF, an organization for the protection of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated to the court that was right in its dispute with the FBI: according to the judgment, Google cannot be forced, through any of the points of the constitution, to provide any kind of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has achieved its pretext to strengthen the child protection law adopted years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and some thousand search phrases, but without getting the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords for the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory to the opinion on Google: those who fear to supply their personal data are criticised because they think that their privacy, their private lives are being damaged by the use of Google services, and they are rebelling against it as against multinational companies of conservative imagery.
Meanwhile, the North American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, come to them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not so to their rival, the Microsoft, catalogued by their Windows as the world conqueror, for so long that both fight for the same goal.
This may happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free software package, constantly updated and seems to be younger, more collaborator than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because the geeks accurately see the very problematic relationship between the rights of people and the Internet that has just been produced by one of the key words mentioned in recent years: the Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving targeted traces behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: show us ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on many collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and even can join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then they can include them in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also have a blog, where the latest photo galleries that are stored in Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
We can know a number of cases of those who appear that, for example, the girl, when she sees the flow of photos of the next morning of the common friends, she agrees with who happened the night before her cheating boyfriend or can dismiss the employee of a company because she writes her honest opinion on her blog about the direction of the company: one thing is safe, the definition of private life has been fully revalued.
The life "on line" of a person is what she shows herself - this is the definition that is hidden behind the conduct of our youth.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least wants to mask Google's monopoly, can do it (starting with, for example, the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but does not leave any traces).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from finding them, but you can replace Google's "on line" applications, from text editing software to image and read news applications with alternative versions that do not connect with giant servers or prepare the perfect profile on us.
Public opinion expects almost openly the day Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM $140 billion), Intel $124 billion or Coca-Cola $110 billion, AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while services that are becoming more and more rapidly cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
Critical observers, however, will also find alarming contradictions: for example, the senior management roundly rejected employee protests after duplicated the company's child care price, considered too much towards the unlimited number of employees' food, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google surrendered to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company, according to the agreement, filtered any information that violates the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but that only when it was already ready to work, what if it is certain that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to go back to the world: while some believe that the Google Book and Magazine project will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be quoted by the United States Supreme Court, others fear its health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with prior analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database can provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, a novel of Cory Doctorow's popular, describes that future in an orwelian way, in which only a man of Google's data can be described alarmly well.
Two minors helped wipe the marks on the author of the double murder in the city of Ozd.
The police interrogated two minors about the double murder of Ozd who, according to reasonable suspicion, helped wipe out the traces of the crime - said on Tuesday the spokesman of the General Public Order Commission of the province of Borsod.
The young people recognized the crime they were charged with, and they are currently accused of crimes.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency - are two girls - can defend themselves in freedom.
Because of the complexity you can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The defendant of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - has been in preventive detention since Sunday.
He was accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he quoted his creditor at the headquarters of a company in Ozd, where he killed him and then also killed his 9-year-old daughter.
According to the ILO, the young man was prepared to commit the crime long before, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden in the scene of the crime.
The police examine with an expert the weapons and the circumstances of their use.
The Warsaw Bag presented an offer to buy the Prague Bag
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - per cent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwick Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish, although the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Bag is in the hands of the state.
99 per cent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State which within a few months wishes to sell 60 per cent of the shares.
The Czech economic journal E15 reported that the Polish offer has been the highest among those offered by interested parties by the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far been offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange last week stated that among those interested the newest owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that, in the future, the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts calculate the value of the Prague Bag in about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders agreement, about 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a participation of approximately 25 per cent, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday's comments on the increasingly deep international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 September".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the US president - he believes that the Republic of Rome - the president has not been able to achieve the support of his own party for the bill made hastily, whose aim is to provide a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new Pearl Habor, spoken of by the multimillionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11".
According to part of the Madrid press, Washington is the expatriate key.
In the view of El World, the error of the political direction of the United States was what led to the world economy on the edge of the abyss.
More and more the danger of demolishing the US monetary system and then this will affect the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congress' vote there was a danger that Washington would not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the major transformations in the history of capitalism is being carried out.
You cannot ignore this threat - points out the Tags-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still take out a life belt to the tax institutions, thus saving them from the collapse with the taxpayers' money.
But if as dominoes disembark even more bank, then they will no longer be sufficient neither the new funds nor the new improvisations.
It is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to abandon their nationalist selfishness and centralise control over fragmented financial markets in the long term.
The financial institutions in crisis received only more than EUR 100 billion on Monday - remembers the Vienna Der Standard, adding that there are increasingly real concerns that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers should also pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not taken seriously the crisis that is taking place as a hostage by the Old Continent .
The "savers" will not have to present at once hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use the funds of the taxpayers to avoid a worse one?
The Smart Car Imitates the Flight of the Abyss
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of existing obstacles sensors in nature?
For example, that of the Aborigines.
In a surprising project presented in Japan's CEATEC, the abbots gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic driving system of the nature-imitating type BR23C cars, to which the characteristics of the aliens were given, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can exacerbate all collisions.
During the flight, each abeyorro creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our protective safety capsule - explained in the Kazuhhiro Doi exhibition, the technology director of RP and development and research.
They play an important role in the composite eyes of the abrasives that are able to see in all directions at an angle above 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eyes, engineers used the length measurement system for laser beams.
This identifies the obstacles to the BR23C within a distance of 2 metres, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle microprocessor which is immediately transformed into a manoeuvre to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds, the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle robot imitating the movements of the aviaries, altering the direction turning the wheels to the necessary extent.
Unlike any existing system at present, this manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
"If not, the vehicle robot could not react quickly enough as to cover the obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the protective safety capsule, within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what makes an aberration to mislead other aberrations.
This process should be carried out in an open and close-eye process.
However, unlike the abrasives, the movement cannot be directed upward, downward or diagonal, but can only be bidimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for apostates to mislead other apostates, here they used only as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotating movement and the acceleration as well as the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and greater its energy density, which means they have a longer life than lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, nor much less the storage capacity.
This device must only process some input signals in each second and react as appropriate.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers, so use only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
No gigabytes or megabytes are needed.
This is the first step to develop the technology to remove the obstacles immediately, which, according to Nissan's calculations, can be incorporated into the models made in series within ten years.
Another possibility for your application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, depriving the existing obstacles in his path.
She already has a name for this lovely child.
The written version of the Financial Rescue Package Act has been prepared of $700 billion that will be applied in several phases in order to buy bad bank credits.
In the first phase half of the money will be spent.
According to Eastern Coast time during the new consultations that lasted until midnight on Saturday, congress leaders reached an agreement on the financial savings package of $700 billion in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the North American Congress, saying that there is only a need to formalise the agreement in a document.
The commitment made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance, speaking of the outcome of the commitment, said: this programme will work and will be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about returning it to the economy car.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before the 8th of the night, according to Washington time (or before two in the morning of Monday, according to Central Europe time), without causing a spectacular leap in the bags.
On the draft law called emergency law for the economic stabilization of 2008, the North American Congress will vote on Monday first and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush consulted Pelosi on Saturday night and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesperson of the White House.
The programme is different from the original Bush administration proposal to spend all 700 billion dollars to buy bad-quality credit fund securities.
Only $700 billion can now be spent, using $250 billion immediately after the Congress vote, probably Monday, of this amount the Ministry of Finance will purchase credit fund securities, bad grades and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the decision of the President.
This programme will be controlled by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion could be spent after a new decision by the Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined approach: it can buy at the same time bad credit, mortgages and credit fund securities, as well as other "venous" type credits.
The purchase can be made either directly or in bribery - they informed competent persons of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in a insurance programme where the portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson said: The law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can reach even 700 billion dollars in order to meet the urgent needs of the US financial system, it is the purchase of bad financial means, its insurance or the prevention of risks that could lead to the demobilization of some major financial institutions.
We do all we can to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks that are in trouble and are waiting for State aid may have the official limitation of their compensations, which the US Argot simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, in addition to the limitations depends on the form of assistance from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry purchases in the framework of a auction, an extra charge will be imposed for gold parachutes, unless the failed head of the bank is retired.
By buying bad credit directly, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the bosses' compensation is not excessive.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in North America's history that will be in force a legal limitation on the income of the Directors-General - Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Congress commission, commented on this measure, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from participating banks in the programme, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can ultimately even obtain profits from the transaction as long as the economy is recovered and the bank is with it.
According to the bill, in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal on how to return the losses of the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their reservations regarding the project.
This is not what the US citizens have ordered, i.e. they are not protecting the taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican congressman in California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague, Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: the measures urged him the same who were responsible for the demobilization of the Wall Street.

The highest price level of basic plastic and chemical materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical production branch (1.6 per cent).
A decrease in prices in the petrochemical sector, (1.4 per cent), in the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the processing sectors of wood (0.1 per cent).
They did not change the prices of paper production, editorials and prints.
In the rest of the processing industry, there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.

Will next year no longer need visa to go to the United States?
Kinginga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the US-Hungarian agreement on visa-exoneration to enter into force on 12 January - the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke of this in Chicago, in front of the Hungarians living there.
In his opinion, "the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic is virtually dependent on the construction in time."
At the same time, he warned that in the new system, the entrance premium would disappear, but tourists should be registered before leaving the country of origin.
From now on, the head of the Hungarian diplomacy holds talks in Washington.
He will be interviewed with the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by delivering the Median Cross with the Star of the Merit Order of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international political advisers of the candidates to the presidency, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the bank's financial rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the chairmanship of the two major American parties, assured on Sunday that they supported the $700 million bank assistance programme, but there were politicians demanding the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The representatives of the Congress and the administration, following several marathon days negotiations, announced on Sunday morning: a principle agreement was reached on the bank's financial rescue package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and decoupling the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, when economic issues were first taken into account, Obama regained some advantage and disappeared the advantage of McCain that he had gained after the Republicans ' convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy to the Vice-President.
In a half of Detroit's campaign, held last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal included those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) the employment is in danger, the saving of you, as well as entire industries and the stability of the whole economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not take advantage of the opportunity to qualify as obsolete the economic concepts of McCain.
In an interview given to ABC McCain explained that "we'll all take this to hard sentences (...) but doing nothing is simply not a viable way."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a control committee for the Prime Minister and the limitation of executive compensation, he insisted.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had played no important role in the consultations, but he consulted the minister daily.
Congress President Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that Congressors will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press release of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group became the most conscious voters - says Der Spiegel about the weak electoral outcome of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a royal coalition.
The mirror (speel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Revolution of Bavaria devours its parents" analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polythologist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad two Beckstein-Huber had assumed his office.
Social Christians had been developing Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are the ones who give them their back.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as is Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that had been foreseen for almost ten years: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU reached 47.7 per cent, for the first time below 50 per cent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernisation of the CSU in the devouring province of its breeders .
The sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the pace they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of the education and settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases opportunities and has political implications.
The right-wing group is intact, only within its own group became the most conscious, more critical and more tested voters.
It is surprising that, in recent weeks, the conventional groups of citizens have been the ones who have gone beyond the CSU; the autonomouss, the small industrials, the ones who have bachelors and the diplomats.
Thus, less than 40 per cent of CSU support was refused.
The Press (depresse.com)
The conservative daily of Vienna: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved on coalition issues" - it deals with the confused situation of internal policy after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The OEF prohibits SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is shown to be open in all directions to negotiate, the greens instead do not yet wish to consult on the coalition.
Elections were already held, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the public television debate, the party leaders just let some of their barricades see.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wished to negotiate with the ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman put forward the question that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the ÖVP, at the post of vice-canceller.
He claimed that in any case they rejected the Schüssel-Molter era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Multiterer responded cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to intervene in the internal affairs of the EDP.
It is still open in the party if they choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must undoubtedly be discussed within the OEF itself.
The president of BZÖ, Jörg Haider, was shown open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to assume the responsibility of the government" - Haider said.
Jaróka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, its host is France that this year is also President of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party by Fidesz, in his message addressed to the full, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, called attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that afflict Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights protection organizations attended the meeting.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of Members in the European Parliament - warned that, in addition to discrimination in employment, the Roma remain outside the labour market first because of their low level of education.
"Most of the young Roma have not completed secondary education and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a minor part can obtain university degree."
Jároka further stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a crucial role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Euro MP, there is a need to raise these issues widely between both the Roma and the non-Gitanians.
As early as the school starts, a gypsum student will have more opportunities to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gitanians, as citizens of the European Union, must guarantee them the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the European Parliament, the European Union's objective and active unity is necessary to speed up the process of school dropout, which is essential for the proper implementation of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"There is a need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, to offer Roma children the opportunity to guarantee democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full-right citizens," Járóka demanded.
The objective of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities organised annually since last year's Berlin meeting, which was held in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a single forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision will be taken at the end of October on the fate of the failed two Huber-Beckstein
Despite the severe electoral defeat, no heads have yet been cut at the summits of the Bavarian CSU, the debate on personal matters has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party president and Günther Beckstein, Prime Minister of the province still remains in his position, but it is not known how long grace will last.
The luck of the two, which suffered a 17 per cent catastrophic electoral defeat, will be decided at the party's extraordinary congress to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the two criticised left the interview: they did not get so attached to their posts.
This was intended to calm the angry members of their parliamentary group and of their basic organization, who one day after the "tsunami bávaro" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the social Christian union reached 60.7 per cent, instead of now, a year after the attack on Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 per cent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria, which gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the South Province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to prevail, in the future, they must undoubtedly coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's potential successors, also has a seat in the small intelligence group that opens negotiations with the Liberal FDP and with the Right-Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about the fate is that in the list of the Free Elections, that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was taken to beat the two Huber-Beckstein and then brutally removed from the scene to the ambitious local policy.
The top leaders of the CSU are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition you will also receive an active role Stoiber has so far been moving the lines in the background, the former head of provincial government and former president of the CSU qualified on 28 September as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and for Angela Merkel himself as well.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel cannot be cancelled unless they are able to highlight together the CSU which played a transcendental role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel that he could hardly hide his disappointment for failure, CSU's losses would not have a negative impact on the great Berlin coalition.
What is, of course, relative: it will not be easier to deal with the injured CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After Sunday's elections, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian parliament.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability it guarantees in the country of Alexandr Lukashenko, in exchange for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral outcome.
Although the country's legislature of 10 million inhabitants, consisting of one hundred and ten Members, has not opposed more than a decade ago, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections, would "allow" the entry of some Members of the opposition to parliament as a result of the amendment of the Constitution.
Thus ODSZ removed the boycott that he originally wanted to do.
In the light of the expectations of the opposition, Belarus, which is increasingly dependent on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the imports of natural gas to Russia and which contributed to the sale of Belarus, the owner of the pipeline passing through the country - wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which did not allow Lukashenko and the other high-level politicians to enter because of having an anti-democracy political regime.
It was a sign of distance when the OSCE, in evaluating the electoral campaign, placed emphasis on positive phenomena rather than on errors - such as the ban on the participation of a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's primary Monday report criticised even its own campaign - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not be present in the vote count.
However, in the opinion of the opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is in a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has already considered the two regions to be independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has been initiated - said our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the candidate for the opposition of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime fears that even an opponent will be allowed to enter that Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not plan to organize protest protests when it sees the results, rather trying to get voters to deliver their message on the need to make economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities make difficulties in front of their distribution, but even so I see that there are more and more people who support the change among older people as well - Milinkevich said, arguing that the Lukashenko regime, who believes that its main outcome is the creation of social security, does not consider it appropriate or even the pensioners, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the debt of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the decomposition of social security that "seems to be the silence of the cemetery" - said Milinkevich.
The Russian observers, contrary to the opposition policy, described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing but testimony of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on there is breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the History of Palacio Chigi that they set up automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
but from today it starts with this measure against who's chipped and then goes to the bar to take a coffee on working hours.
This novelty has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services" the minister says.
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency is open.
This is Reformism," Brunetta stressed again.
With Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There has been no resistance on the part of employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It has been a change shared by the workers and there has been collaboration on the part of them".
Finally, they no longer breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and lunches.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good capuchin at 7 in the morning is a holy hand."
During a convention at the School of Public Administration
from Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absence of public employees' diseases has been reduced by 50%, meaning 60,000 more people at work in one year".
And it adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more effective
Italian, "which wage dynamics – the minister explains – in the last 8-10 years have been double in relation to the private sector and well above the inflation rate".
For now, millions of public employees have joined in opposing the rules of the Brunetta decree by complying with the Codacons-supported petition.
"While the Minister of the Public Service shows the numbers, the lowest absence of work due to disease – writes consumer association – the people of the 'empty workers' are growing .
In Italy, there are millions of employees of the right and productive public administration who have joined in declaring war on the illegal rules of the decree."
In particular, the Tar calls for the exclusion of aggregated economic treatments due to disease due to service; the extension of the time-frames in which the medical check visits of the sick employee are carried out; and other aspects contained in the new provisions sought by the Minister.
Work accidents, Napolitano: "Creative Prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deaths in respect of murders.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today, Anmil celebrates the 58th National Day of the Victims of Work Accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association mutilated and invalid for work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses his "great appreciation for the continued partnership effort in the prevention of work, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"It has been manifested, a 'suffering', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies which, by their dimensions, provoke the cry of the media and the participation of the public opinion, instead of the everyday reality offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is no doubt a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives promoted in the school field are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislation.
For its part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber has stressed " how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which violates the conscience of each of us and imposes a determined effort on all institutions to put an end to it urgently."
"The data on accidents at work seems to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We really don't want this "tender to decrease" to be translated into less attention, because it's just when attention decreases that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level there is still too little to compare the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
We need, at our discretion - Mercandelli has highlighted - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world."
"It serves a further effort - it has added - as regards the communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers regarding a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection provided for the victims of work" and "the assistance derivation to which the system is being directed in recent years".
"The aim is to restore the worker's insurance guarantee - he added - because the luck of the person who gets the accident does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator every time."
Mp3 readers in charge, put the hearing at risk
Listening to high volume music for a long time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent injury to the hearing.
It is the European Commission, which, in a communiqué published in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risk (Csseri) of the Ue, published today.
"From this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – it arises that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour per day having the high volume device risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who often use portable musical devices and high-level cellular phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific evidence – follow the responsibility Ue – there is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What counts is to raise awareness of consumers and to deliver this public domain information.
We need to review, in addition to the control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and take a step towards new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise it caused.
"Scientists - the executive Ue concludes - confirm that this is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and stakeholders that measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable and similar musical devices."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concerns increase as the auditory damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damage by using solutions such as reducing levels and noise exposure time.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee Ue points out that the users of portable musical devices listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limit for maximum noise permitted at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for longer periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that 5-10% of users of such devices are affected and the number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the Ue.
Rome, Germany sends it to the Commission for the future of capital
Today, the accounts will be closed in March.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Terms of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the municipal council will evaluate analysis and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bubble" of the Municipality and its intentional Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to stress German – it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council can then be evaluated.
There is no role left, only the will to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June – announces the intention – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that its opinions are not binding, Germany answers: "Everything depends on the work which will be able to carry out the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Politics is almost always aggrieved in regular management and in times of emergency that are once again manifested.
On the contrary, we want to look more there and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
Rome's intention is further to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost Roman citizens a euro and it will serve to make the best minds express the capital".
For Germany, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or mobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which we have an absolute need, thinking in a unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, according to Rome's intention, would not only be limited to the present municipal borders but would look beyond it" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must develop as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first president of anti-American.
He wrote an American political note that interests him to pass independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks against Obama are increasing as the date of the elections approaches.
a woman from Miami wrote on a Web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great stone face: he believes he wins the highest position of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!".
In fact, they are attacks that don't say much; they are obviously attacks of racial nature and they don't answer the voters' question: will it be a good president? And are the probes; they all say Obama wins and has a good advantage.
Also in this case there is one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A daily in Mississippi, in the inner courtyards of the south of the United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote, we will know who will vote for the American patriot.
It comes out one side of the United States mindset covered up to the last.
"Tell them what they want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama comes to win, we'll leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent her home to kicks in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to make the bags.
Also, Iraq for the majority has been Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes over George W's position will have a huge duty to develop.
Use, economic collapse is also made for journalists: in newspapers it is time to cut. Many blame the Internet, "kill" of the printed paper.
Fifty American journalists have been questioned by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
But today journalists are almost all pessimists about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared themselves less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a ruined economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where editors work to carry out the newspaper is a major problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if traditional journalism does not want to be substantially reduced as the majority of the public understands it.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the U.S. journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Print against issue.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The largest editorial houses open a crack on the Internet, for many views as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" warned journalists have increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are covering technology in the hope "that it does something good" for journalism.
Today's biggest break in American journalism is between who runs the newspapers – or the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56 per cent of executives at the national level are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage is down to 23 per cent.
For some, this has to do with the "security of work".
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
For the periodic staff, 30%.
The "safe job" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a nation such as the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of "getting or leaving".
Directors receive almost always good wages, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, but retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to arrive at 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, "hell" followed during the year.
It's just a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: THE TRIBUNAL OF ROME, DANILO COPOPOLA IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinadu, has decided to reject the real estate court Danilo Coppola who had requested to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is indicted by bankruptcy in the field of counter-agreement investigation on the Unipol-Bnl scale.
In the course of the arrest process, last week, he obtained his release home, transforming it into a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate may use the city's route to a capital room.
According to the court, these travels (for which the PM has voted otherwise) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence they accuse him of.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already emerged a few days ago with the vote of the chamber of representatives against the saving plan of $7 billion launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this was, rather interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times gives us a confirmation yesterday, informing us that the current crisis is disarming the Republican party, which is increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, in return, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, strong especially in the states of the Centre and the South.
The soul, in fact, has become prepotent with the vote of the one who was speaking at the beginning.
This is just quoted as an example of the mutations, of the major mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not just here.
Both in the United States and in Europe for a long time, the crisis seems to act as an accelerated incubator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate are solidified and coming out of the light.
The first of these phenomena is the re update, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual category of state-sovereignity in relation to a type of re nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is, in fact, a crisis of banking institutions - which, if they have strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all, the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more committed.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for those who rule it is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and of those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically worldwide but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of play, or they don't have much to say: the crucial proof is the European Union that is always divided as between the different interests and the different state strategies does not reach a decision on any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and, above all, the grant of funds: from the time it comes to the court, it is only the state that owns the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of uncalculated value, values in certain circumstances in which no market is likely and no organization can ever have the same measure.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-of-the-nation is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance provided that the new development of the economy tends to attribute a very related factor to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already intended to dominate the world, we realized that our future would have to make the accounts more and more with the little immaterial things such as water, crops and oil.
All things that can be carried from one place to another from the earth but are also absolutely united in a confined space, a territory.
So he who is a sovereign has certainly many more letters in respect of him who is not, and he who has the shame of living in a position without crops, without oil, and without water.
I come to the second novelty that but presupposes a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Policy and Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective consciousness of the need for leadership, the request of anyone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leadership, of a marked economic nature inadequate with many dark areas.
And together, something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the Western countries in an increasing number.
It seems always to advance more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far up and down, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the understanding exception of the term, having made their own time and being more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in few words, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the leading classes and traditional political structures, which are reflected in an electoral "revelita" or sudden changes in collective humors of recent times, from the conservative exit to the collapse of the Social-Democratic Consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and also covered with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do with it).
It is felt that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their journals, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say anything, make it increasingly difficult to understand and then to represent, what since today is taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and acts potentially in dismeasurement.
In front of all this talking about a "mass revolution" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue to walk on the walls
To overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in a future walk on the walls like the spider man.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has approached a lot.
With an adhesion of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to have stuck a body of 100 kilos on a vertical wall.
EL STUDIO – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, of Akron, of Georgia Institute of Technology and of the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of the existing ones that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a waste of spaghettis" explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of gecos, covered by microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflon and alloy paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time "is easily removed from the walls" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
JOIN FOR PAREDES? -"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through the walls exactly like the spider man? Layers, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are drivers of heat and electricity.
Other applications might have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes for the moment.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - The University of Berkeley, in California, is also dedicated to the search for a new adherent.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California researchers have presented an adhesive made of micro fibers like hair that are self-cleaned from dust during the movement on a surface to maintain a perfect adherence.
Pharmaceuticals: never with fruit juice
Attention to the apple juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken concomitantly with some drugs, their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing, as appropriate, the efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packed that freshly associated with the absorption of some medicinal products David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, which since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in progress sends a new alarm to Philadelphia: enough a glass of apple juice, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some drugs, canceling the beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
The apple juice was already under charge because it was held responsible for increasing some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, ansolitic, antihistamine and neurological medicinal products at toxic levels.
PHARMACLES TO RISGES – The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a two-year newsletter alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink in the case is taking a drug such as Diasepam or methadone.
NOT ONLY THE POMELO – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active principles inhibited by apple and other games.
From here the call for Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan: "These discoveries are generally pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually try to change their information notes.
That is why we must always read the illustrative leaflets of the medications that are being taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us be impressed, ask clearly to the doctor or pharmacist» the expert of the Ansa agency stressed.
The New Economy in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman by his studies, his business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Keynesian neo who teaches at Princeton University and is a New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the 11 September 2001 attack, in those days he broke Enron, Krugman had planned in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years has come reproached the economy, but that has now been revealed exactly.
"I am surprised and a little upset by how the memory of the scandal of Enron and Worldcom collapse has quickly disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a publisher with a "very aggressive" style, particularly critical against the excessive liberalism of Bush administration.
Open Office, here's the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source of personal productivity suite that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year by volunteers, whose back is monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with a number of news: on the welcome screen and the less gross magazine interface, add other more consistent, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version ISO.
Attention is also given to multi-function with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via email, or the possibility to import the PDF file into the graphics processing module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
On this front, hybrid PDF documents can always be created, which accumulate the typical graphics of Adobe format with elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
The Collaboration is an element that has received various improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet you can intervene in a number of users, avoiding conflicts of changes in the drafting of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition at the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some of the functions of OpenOffice to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usually the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The CD installation at home or at work may also be sent on request.
And if the free theme can be a connection to the distribution in the homes, it is in business that Open Office will test the suite, try the big bet, and can already count on a number of projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And there is no lack of even the realities that provide an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the calculation sheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint presentation; Dbase, eating in the case of known Access is the program that allows you to work on the base date; and finally Draw the graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand so far, with the release of the new version is likely to exceed the expected figure.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case in the tour of France: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, third grader and winner of the best remere of the climber.
To give the news is the site of the L'Equipe newspaper.
Kohl, 26 years old is the fourth positive runner to the third generation era, after the Italians Ricardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also those of Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples is among those conducted in the last few weeks in the Losanna laboratory and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the evidence confirms that it is positive, the Austrian will lose third position on the Tour and go against the two years of canonical decalization.
To confirm Kohl's positive doping news in the third generation Epo is the head of the French antidoping agency, Pierre Bordy, who has declared to the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has been placed on the podium at the back of Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, awarding the best climber's memory.
INSTRUCTIONS: NEW YORK TIMES ARE QUESTIONED, ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy from an immigrant country has only recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" received with hostility.
This is turning the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is asking a long article that has devoted itself to the debate on the issue of racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso murdered last month in Milan for stealing a cookie box.
This case illustrates what the New York Times defines as the "north paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are recorded, but also the highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support of the North League".
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation, which the Law called for, also supports the ban on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines, is cited as a paradigm for climate change in Italy.
The tendency is marked by the Pope who by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano finding Benedict XVI at Congress has asked the State and the Church to work together to combat racism."
Students who are victims of cheap rent, up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for universities does not know the crisis.
According to Sunia's latest survey, the rental union, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already taken on very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people at the highest cost that the family would have to bear – explains the head of Sunia's study office, Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong demand has completely distorted the market to such a point of triggering a process of generalized increase for residents."
Apart from the fact that in most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, without canon limit, under bonded rentals.
For Sweden, extraordinary interventions are necessary which, through the revision of the tax burden, can regulate prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, by a bed in the Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; by an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere zone) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students focus on areas near the University, they serve €250/280 per bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 per individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) they ask you about 600 euros for an individual room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It is only economical if the peripheral area is changed: EUR 300 per bed and 450 per individual room in Prenestina, Centocelle area and surroundings.
In Naples, you have 300/450 euros for a bed, a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed, you have 250/350 euros, at least 350 for an individual.
in the youngest cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a higher weight in the economy of the city.
In the cities like Perugia, where the renting of students and extra-Communitys is more common, a further anomaly is reported: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradise, the cities cancel the historic halls
Historical cinematographic rooms close favoring the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic rooms in a blind city is like a face without eyes."
The image offered by Director Giuseppe Tornatore photographes effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticians in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono-rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory," it is as if a friend died, a well-known person with whom a piece of place and so much emotion was shared," observes the director of the new film Paradise, the film that was twenty years ago won the first Oscar and the grand jury award to Cannes, who counted the poetry of a movie room in the province and the nostalgia in the way of living the film that was lost perhaps forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of traders, are clear: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and to pay most are mainly the rooms of the main cities: 10 minus in Florence, 9 minus in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 minus in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures are the first, Emilia-Romana with 82 smaller cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for his disappearance is the adventure of multiplex, these three Italian regions themselves that have recorded the largest number of new methic cinemas: 195 screens but in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romema.
“Italian exercise has been irrationally developed” notes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, “it would be useful for new structures to be built but it would be necessary to ensure that those already existing exist, because when a city hall closes, not all its members are willing to transfer to the mechanics.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the previous debt of the state is approximately EUR 10 million.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To support the sector, between EUR 16 and 18 million per year would be used."
Interestingly to the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned by the closures, decided to repair itself with the signature of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and protect the film mono room either in the historical center or in the periphery.
The proposed rules include means of tax facilitation in favour of managers and advantages to the public in terms of mobility: viewers can enter the restricted area of traffic and have special parking rates.
"It is an initiative that I like" notes Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures.
It is true that in contrast to the extra power of mechanics, traditional rooms need to improve the quality of sound and image because today the public is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the movies in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to carry out the "New Paradise cinema", which I had been thinking about for 10 years now.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I move forward to the Rialto or the National Road Quirinale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the dusty posters, I turn to the other side.”
The link between politics and 'andrangetta, has been arrested by the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the elections of the Municipality for those interested in the Pyromalli cosca."
The allegations made by the magistrates of the Antimaphic Directorate of Calabria are serious to the intent and vice-sponsor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the intent of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafia association.
Also arrested is Gioacchino Piromelli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his lawyer granddaughter, homonymous of the boss, already convicted of mafia criminal association and compensationing 10 million euros.
"Despite any legal and moral standards, and in good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay counsel Piromalli.
"It would have been allowed to the Mafia family - the judges write - to officially enter the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the regional committee called Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agazio Loiero's agreements between organized evil life are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'andrangetta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
The arresters this morning add to those of last July after the police had announced the court of the Mafia Piromelli family.
Since the end of the past April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had dissolved, in 1991 and always because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been given the responsibility to administer the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, a member of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the May 2006 ballout, had been elected head of a right-wing coalition.
A scandal explodes when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call in question the vice-minister of the interior who was Marco Minniti at that time, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piromelli had even come to ask for the variation of the draft road A3.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, a representative of a very close group to the Piromelli clan, uniforming the public administration's elections on the interests of Mafios families".
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones go down to the stage
It is an extreme deposit that occupys more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now discovering it, the major global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones look like Chevron.
The possibility of energy recovery of the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil was low in 1980, the idea of using marine energy was separated, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the wave movement of the sea.
This amount would be the double of the currently produced nuclear power plants.
And there would be currents and tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has signed an agreement to build an implant in Northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced, it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are always more and among these companies who have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – he has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the American oil mill in the Wall Street Journal – and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a very important sign, if it is considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to make new drillings.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey follow the road of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about a technology yet at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now, the impacts such as those of Portuguese or Scottish are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good unity between them.
The force of the waves, which causes the good to move upwards and downwards, becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside of them.
Pressure turns a turbine that feeds a generator in turn.
Electricity is shipped to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four such implants on the development path, pending the federal approval, by energy, could serve as a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a commercial centre and for a parking lot, using submarine turbines in the East New York River.
The water movement when there are tides, turns the turbines' pallets, creating a rotating motion that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the Development of Electricity, is now worth the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is above all about the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coast, have invested $7 million in 2008 and an investment of 35 million for 2009.
