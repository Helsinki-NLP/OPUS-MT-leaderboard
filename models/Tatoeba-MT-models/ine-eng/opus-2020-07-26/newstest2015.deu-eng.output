The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has met with his first important foreign visit since his election in May to discuss economic and security policy relations with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the third largest economic nation in the world.
Plans for enhanced nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes for a defence cooperation agreement between the two nations.
Police of Karatha arrested 20 years after fast motorcycle chase
A motorcycle was taken after the driver drove it with 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbao.
Transport politicians in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle tomorrow after watching it leave a tanker on the Bathdate Road with 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on the Burgess Road before he went down to the bush country where the officers lost it out of sight.
The motorcycle and a person who corresponded to the driver's description were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The police of Karatha accuse a 20-year-old man of not observing a stop sign and reckless driving.
He was to appear in Karatha on September 23rd in court.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster for Hotel Violations in Naim and Pitlochry
A man stands before the court for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was charged with a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of rapeing a woman at a hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she "was unconscious, slept, and could not signal an agreement."
Webster is also proposed to have raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae appointed the negotiating term for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Returning to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressional Agents Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.
"As trade unions die, so do middle class jobs," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and deputy president of the Progressive Caucus at the Congress.
I am therefore proud to present with the Ombudsman John Lewis the law on employee authorization.
This railway law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination due to the organisation of trade unions as for other forms of discrimination - and thus stops pre-traded forces.
The addition of the national labour law to create an opportunity for discriminated workers to organise a trade union representation in order to appeal before a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - otherwise not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill is to connect back to a very American idea.
Despite the backlogs that the trade unions have suffered in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries all over the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, extend and respect labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in a spirit.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militaryized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that workers and their trade unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the workers' rights to union and joint negotiations and actions are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff forced the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers would have to organize themselves and should raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations to ensure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and every profession or profession.
Agreements which restrict or aim to narrow it are null and void; measures aimed at it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency over the International Commission on Human Rights, by which the General Declaration of Human Rights was designed, as it was adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join unions to protect his interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic assumptions that labour rights are human rights.
When this country discusses how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to establish a trade union - and that this trade union should then be allowed to participate in collective negotiations as an equal partner with companies and government bodies.
After these rights have been exercised in America, it is in fact very wise to re-examine the American ideal, so that the working population must have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the worker movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has created a wonderful market for industry and raised the whole nation at unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story preserves them.
History reminds us, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - is far too difficult.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and have replaced the promise of democracy.
The judge stops the temporary law that could force all withdrawal clinics in Louisiana to close
On Sunday, a U.S. attorney temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, from which the lawyer said that it was likely to lead to the closure of all five decommissioning clinics in the state.
This measure, which was raised by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and is due to enter into force on 1 September, would require doctors to perform the removals to require a patient admission right in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal deductions temporarily while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while they are trying to achieve these rights," Federal Justice John deGravelles wrote in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing shall be held for the judge to make a more permanent decision for the law.
The decision-makers welcomed the latest in a number of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors spent so much time in order to obtain hospital rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana withdraw a withholding law that wants them to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and president of the Center for Reproduction Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not directly clear whether the judgment had also been extended to the doctors from the two clinics which did not join the complaint and had also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
The key points of a law in Texas, which most of the clinics left in the state, were closed by a federal judge on Friday.
Advocacy advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that the right of admission of doctors requires unnecessary restrictions.
Anti-depressants are opposed to the fact that measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who carries out trials in Louisiana has patient information rights, the centre for reproductive rights was informed.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced to stop doing decommissioning, this doctor would, in fear of his safety, no longer perform the operation, the group said.
In its argument against the judgment, the representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the conduct of abortions, while their applications would still be subject to patient rights.
Late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher rates of death by eggstock cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video hommage for their mother, who died of eggstock cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from eggstock cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, in which ovaries were detected in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after the diagnosis.
The research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Small study: New medicines could slow lung and egg cancers
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of egg cancer, existing pre-existing diseases, and the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancers had already progressed at the time of diagnosis, survival rates were the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city died with a higher probability of eggstock cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a late diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and they are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services in order to counter the removals, it proposed, as a possible remedy, to strengthen the service of qualified doctors in order to enable specialists to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographical status, provided a poor long-term survival rate for women in egg cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and care strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is currently published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of eggstock cancer.
Garden centres regret falling number of households
The decline, together with an increased decline in the number of household owners under 35 years, could result in tens of thousands of pounds per year being lost by garden centres when the young consumers of today's HTA study, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "Cernal Group for Garden Products".
The report says that tenants spend on average 55 percent of the amount spent on people with their own home for their garden.
The rise of people living in high urbanised areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting advances for parking purposes and the declining garden sizes are other factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated 5 billion £ per year is implemented in sales.
In the large area of London, where the proportion of households aged 61 to 43 per cent has fallen over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure for garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that homes for rent or small gardens do not mean that people can't plant.
Guy Barter, CEO of the RHS said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants in a transport."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail trade due to increasing household ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year because of better weather according to unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement led by opposition politician Imran Khan and spiritual Tahirul Qadri continues in Pakistan.
In the capital of Islamabad, some 1,000 protesters have stormed the state television PTV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protestors back out of PTV buildings.
The transmitter introduced its operation for about 40 minutes, but is now resending.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometer away, they supplied with pieces and stones equipped with security forces.
The police put in trengengas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he denied it.
The army of the country therefore calls for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and using no violence".
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday night, the military announced: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already played more often.
The opposition politician Imran Khan proposes that Prime Minister Sharif be elected in the elections last May.
The protests were staged at the weekend, after Khan and Qadri had called their supporters to force Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed at the time.
Turkey orders US diplomat for espionage reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has commissioned the country's oldest diplomats to report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the businessmen of the US Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine The Mirror and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that also had the most important secret service of Germany Ankara in the visa, provided for significantly worse reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning: Drivers threaten with consequences for pendler
On Monday evening, the federal warning route of the driver could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The situation announced for between 18 and 21 hours concerns all transport companies in the Federal Republic of Germany, including remote, regional and S-road transport,
The main focus of the alert is freight.

said the district president of the German Locomotivführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We're counting on major accidents.
There are no regional priorities.
The main focus of the alert is the transport of goods.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where they want to strike, so it is difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Police chief of Magalup of Corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence to the State Prosecutor's Office of Mallorca for repression by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià.
The chief of the police of Calvià on the island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Commissioner-in-Office José Antonio Navarro was arrested on charges of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the road in which most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the Mallorca Diario Online Daypaper, the prosecutors presented evidence of repression by policemen and employees of the city of Calvià to the State Prosecutor's Office for Corruption Combating Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local politicians were arrested by the Spanish Guard Civil in connection with the corruption proposals and are questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish National Daily ABC reported that the angry night club owners said that the government's parenting economy had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our base of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
In this summer, Magaluf made international battle lines due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who completed 24 men during a trip to Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the orderly behaviour of alcoholic holidayers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the announced alcohol-restricted taps.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatia event took place, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and the Kneipentour organizer Carnage together have to pay a fine of 55,000 € ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular for young British holidayers, is also known for several accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "balconing", when people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The frühling has protected South Australia a winter surprise, with strong spectators and strong wind, which affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21:00, another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6,6mm, which had already gone down the night to Sunday.
The last blow was the result of a series of short, stormy spectators, including a goose that started just 20 hours ago and provided almost 4mm of impact in about 10 minutes.
After the last week of winter had taken care of an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8°C.
The gentle weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft would have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but it was hit by a sharp wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to continue.
Windstorms reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to start on a second landing trip and finally set up approximately 20.40.
The delay led to the delay of some other flights, including an emirate flight from Dubai and a quantum flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible spectators.
Matthews means: Maximum time to big network
In view of the elusive technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech terminals, our columnist Bernd Matthias is confident with a highly trusted electronic access.
While I'm writing this here, I look at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, "Boah, how retro is that?"
But there's a thought behind it: if the cable wasn't, in the shortest time, all the listeners would fly around the house in vain, and that would be much more retro.
Does this apply to the electron (electronic) anyway?
No, error tip: electronic) sector the rule that the world's newness of today's electric shock of tomorrow is bought - obsolete.
And for example, who still has a tube TV in the living room today, who just says that he basically rejects television.
Why these considerations?
Because the drag of the ifa at the funkturm this week brings back our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The Laie, who was once blind ruler of the washing machine and CD-player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread with unmatched iltimised expert speech before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press station.
Yeah, is that it?
What are you going to talk to people who are obviously volunteering to spread such a Quark?
In fact, it has been going on for about 20 years, above all, that we are supposed to connect our house.
In order for the Joghurt to order himself to inform us on the holidays on the Maldives that it is burning in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we were from the office from the air conditioning on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, but this presupposes an air conditioner.
But a dream will soon come true: We lift our wristwatch, they say, "Sweet!" - and the vacuum robot goes home.
Irre.
Everything goes on to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are floating," says a industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report, and the data flash shows how long pizza in the oven still needs, but it's useless because we're in the mood.
From daily practice, we also know: If a new-mode device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed empty.
What's another reason that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after spending the summer in airspace, while rocket and mortar shootings on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the fights.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities drawn from rocket fires in southern Israel, but the signs of the struggles are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the Pashosh child park, which was hit by a rocket, before the students found grenades from the walls and sliding walls.
"We're a bit afraid, but they're excited," said Ronit Bart, resident of the Kibbutz Seed and English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it feels "a little funny" to go back to school all of a sudden.
"It was difficult times, and we didn't go out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border to Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire last week, thousands of inhabitants of the border communities like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and to escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a community near the border to Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Your children were temporarily placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which is heavily affected by the Palestinian siege.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fight; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as the demand for Hamas after the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the airports and seaports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and for the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battles.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel contests these data and estimates that at least half of the victims are combatants, however, there was no concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during the fights in Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were built into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and fights, the education authorities moved last week to the beginning of the school year.
"I hope that the school will soon be reopened so that we can continue to learn, just as the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
By choice in Sachsen: CDU-Vize Strobl submits NPD-prohibiting procedures
In view of the loss of vote of the NPD in Sachsen, CDU-Bundesvise Thomas Strobl addressed himself to the Federal Constitutional Court for an end to the ongoing NPD-prohibiting procedure.
Berlin - According to the CDU-Bundesvise Thomas Strobl, the ongoing bans against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is cutting worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also head of CDU in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a joyful development in the right direction and a development that will lead me rather to the result that we are politically fighting the NPD rather than in front of the Constitutional Court.
At the vote on Sunday, the NPD was almost at the fifth-per-per-cent rate.
A first call for a ban on the right-wing party was made in 2003 because the constitutional protection was also available in the NPD department at the time.
In December 2013, after long preparation, the Federal Council introduced a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Federal Day do not agree.
Harburg: Tents for New Refugees
In the new country, refugees are now being held in tents.
The central recording for refugees in Harburg is taking place from all quarters.
Now the internal authority has set up three tents of the red cross.
The district politicians were briefed just before - they are not excited.
"These Hauruck actions continue to undermine the reservations of the citizens and do not allow the policymakers to contribute constructively to the human accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, a group president of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Your Party requests that the Harburg district administration provide unused houses for accommodation at present.
96 Refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overcoming the first take-up are the storm of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide adequate places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter growth in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, so the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research manager of RP Data, Tim Lawless, informed that Sydney and Melbourne were operating a two-part market.
The figures of RP data show that house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 per cent last year, in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices on average increase by five and six percent.
On the other hand, Canberra is located at the end of the scale, which was hit hard by the cuts in government expenditure and where prices rise only by 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr Lawless further said that with the early spring now, there would be an increase in the properties for sale that would be subject to "a real test" in the market for the next few months.
"When considering the constant high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the constant low interest rate, it is likely that the domestic prices will continue to increase over the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the new press, he contradicts the statements of Managing Director Peer Medau and certifies this to "put on a fielder."
The style of the university is not this, it's in the notice.
Thus, the Medau family has already been informed "Mitte Juni orally about the meaning of the university.
The statement that the plans were known only in July is definitely wrong," Pötzl said.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "preventions or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle is also less dramatic than the Medaus.
It was from a nine-metre wide road and it's not the talk.
It is about 5,50 meters, which is a meter wider than it has been", Pötzl explains.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school parking spaces in the future will then only be used by students of the university, Pötzl does not want to apply.
Parking is not available at all because it can be managed intelligently, as in other public parking spaces.
Think of the Residents
The children's hips of mountain fever, which is located on the ground and would lead to access to the park deck in front of their door, are to be "no harm" according to the President of the High School.
He says, "This is not only about the children's hips, but also about the residents at the installation on Friedrich-Strieb Street and the 800 students of the neighbouring Real School.
Thus, it is much more than the particular interests of the Medau," Pötzl said.
Whether the criticism of the parental counsel of children's hips, the expansion of the road would be justified by a "lost of the few natural spots of Coburg" and "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Building Bamberg, will inform the cities of the construction of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new resolution".
Last week, Peer Medau informed the parents of the children's hips about the plans of the university.
Therefore, the access to the new parking deck is not intended to lead, as has been done so far, through the campus and the Friedrich strike street, but through the Medau mountain.
This meant that the narrow road had to be two-legged for about a mile long.
According to the Medus calculations, traffic in Hohenfels Castle Park would be spread.
Of about 2000 vehicles every day, the talk is.
On the side of the city, they did not wish to express themselves to the project until now.
Glandorf returns from Handball National Team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Federalist SG Flensburg-Handewitt introduced health problems for this decision.
The decision is not easy for me, it has been taken over several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the National Team," the World Championship of 2007 told on his Facebook page.
It is therefore going with a balance sheet of 167 country games and 576 towers for Germany in international peace.
Because the fire-fighting space player for the Flensburg Champions League winner wants to go to Torejagd for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the island, which announces its box on Tuesday for the country games against Switzerland, Glenorf led a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me just as they will inspire my long-standing companions and my followers.
But for my club I would also like to be healthy in the next few years, for which longer regeneration breaks are necessary which do not allow the current double load.
The left hand had to fear his career after a Fersen infection in 2012.
Because of Achilles’ problems, he had been treated by teammates of the German Handball Association (DHB) with a cortisone syringe that later triggered a severe inflammation.
One notoperation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf announced a complaint against the team doctor that the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team careers don't go through a body without trace.
I have some health facilities that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infectious foot operations that took place in 2012 in short steps, I never got my blood pressure right in the grip.
In this regard, a number of other complaints were raised.
Already at the beginning of the year, I noticed that I was driving my head, but my body can't fool," Glandorf explained in the interview the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comeback he would only be available in the absolute emergency.
"When all the strikes go, I'm always ready to talk," explained the two-time family father to the trade magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years I can play handball.
I also have to say that after my long stay in the hospital in 2012 I have also become quite humble with regard to my health.
After my career, at least I want to be able to go a little straight.
In addition to the 2007 WM title and the win of the 2014 Champions League, he won the 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) the EHF Pokal.
In 2012, Flensburg also secured itself with the Pokalsiger's European Cup.
German economy in the spring by 0.2% collapsed
The crises around the globe have stopped the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product fell by 0.2% from April to the end of June 2014.
This was shared by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed provisional calculations.
Only consumption survived the economy in the spring, while the investments decreased.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual growth for the first half of the year, a total GDP plus 0.8 per cent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led the city of Burgmann for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion on Sunday by Dutch "Fietzenehrer".
The largest sports association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "Münsterland-Mooiste".
This is the largest bike tour through Münster, the bike paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1,000 participants thanked Jos ter Hurene for organizing this tour through Münsterland.
Published in various journals, this tour was offered to interested people.
We come from Den Helder and are traveling overnight to take part in this tour.
We also want to get to know the country in this way once more," the bikers were happy about the route through the districts Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the Association of the Schutzbroderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the Wall, where it also started.
Furthermore, the route, which was written for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 meters of height, 120 kilometres with 1475 meters of height and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of height, the riders proved their good condition.
They were buried on their way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Chief organizer Jos ter Hurene and Mayor of Heinz Lölfing were very happy about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all the participants.
The organization died without problems and there were no negative events," Heinz Lölfing takes a positive turn for this event.
Unfortunately, not so many participants, as the organizer had hoped, arrived, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see ourselves again in 2015 in a hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the bikers promised to return to the country of Münster and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Constantin Weckers Unscrupulous Honest Memories
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Constantin Wecker, singer, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, brought to paper on 287 pages in "Monch and Warriors".
Not chronologically, but more thoughts for thoughts, the Munichn born on June 1, 1947, wrote down his memoirs, each chapter started with a suitable song text.
And he's not honest about it: From Onania as a gymnasium to shoplifting and drug use, he doesn't allow human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Wider space also includes abstract but so much more important terms: love, soul, ego, being now, spirituality - all of which he tries to go on the ground, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social critique, his political commitment - and also, as he not only expressed his music (the opera lover became the soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
Finally, Lebemann Konstantin Wecker also brought closer to the ascetic monk, who is created "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary".
Among all the high-spirited views, however, there are also short anecdotes to the earth: for example, about beatings in a local area frequented by GIS or a waving car, where he suggested a tree frontal.
He's not honest here, too.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and his relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is concerned about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to meet him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: "Listen to the strength.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to look at Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had grown up when I was a child - went with him to the button and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket blow.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a pipeline in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's time, he gained an insight into how life would have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, contaminated, deep sticky labyrinths with flames and smoke and lots of rust.
My father just walked into the bathtub before, and then he could hear him slowly, as he began to sing, because he was able to wash the toilet.
When I got around there, it became clear to me that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my attention to him grew.
However, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' expressions of love.
My father never hugged me, he didn't say "I love you."
Only when my mother had a bad time against the end of her life will we start to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you"
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with the "I love you" thing?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He's still friends with French, with whom he's been married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This led to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I pulled through this fitness and I also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's hard.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career shift may show up in his elegant, short-cut bar.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been taken from the theatre.
It followed the comedy of mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his working life.
He was only 16 years old when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the middle of the 1970s. "I was the only black Imitator/Comedian on TV for a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also learned from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke counting machine, while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage law at the Black and White Minstrel Show, an easy entertainment program in which people "black painting", Henry led his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it would never happen, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a despicable, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects with and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "yearly priced light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
Through the introduction of figures that ridiculed the British black culture as well as celebrated, Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went to the station in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among others as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedy series Chief!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles were his next decade, but after his BBC series Lenny Henry.tv in 2008 he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it's all that you feel, that you just bring the time to room or get a little in place?"
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first consequence was Shakespeare.
I was regular allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and kept him mostly for a domain of the middle class, white in pantyhose and a coal head in front.
So I was very afraid of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it once.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry made 20 lines out of Othello's last speech for the documentary film and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally set my head right.
"That's why it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he came into the comedy of the mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctive that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to break through 10 minutes now while they're repairing the computer."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the presentation continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from stage to stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a theater piece, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the teeth.
That too was good, so it's like a great sign of the gods who say to me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a WOMAN's voice.
So I stay here.
I really love that.
I love being in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has gone through humourful outbursts, while he constantly imitates people.
I have decided not to make stand-up comedy, because I find this kind of immediate satisfaction from a room full of strangers to be dangerous somehow.
If you're looking for it all, you're driving it to a wall.
I sometimes get alive in the Apollo when I like it, but I don't have as much as I used to.
I'm asking him if he'll make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I want to give it up again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between the Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi followers had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a speaker from the Huthi party said "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports of a traffic crash in the capital.
According to the online edition of the "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened the sheet with a further escalation of the conflict, but his demands should not be met.
The Shiite Huthis fight for more independence from the Sunnily-ruled Yemen and call for the return of the government.
The people's tribe of Huthi has occupied the capital of Yemen for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the major access routes of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area, there is always bloody fighting with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officers to protect "spirited"
Kenya has thus begun to biometrically register all state officials to delete "spirit workers" from the government's tax lists.
Employees who were not registered in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, said a government notice.
The government expects thousands of people to receive payments even after they have been released from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised at his entry into office in 2013, to fight corruption in the public service.
In an examination at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (700,000) per month of payments for "spirit workers" and other abuses of financial practices were lost.
The government assumes that fees will continue to be paid on accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports to the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must now appear in identification centres in the next two weeks in order to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, a government message has been communicated.
All those who would not do this without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the communication continued.
"This process will contribute significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also adjusting the balance sheet at both levels of government - thus eliminating the "spirited" employees," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal about the Kunstsberate Helge Achenbach will be dealt with for the first time on 11 November in court.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, in a civil process at the Düsseldorf Landgericht require 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings.
This was shared by a court-martial on Monday.
In the complaint it is said that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and old-timers and Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than the actual purchase price paid.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach has purchased for 121 million euros worth of Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years old in school, 23 of them as head of school.
From this time on, Manfred Richter knows many standing Petershauser and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always worn by his efforts to see people in school.
The snowdrop is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today Trutnov.
At age 14, he was interested in higher education after four years.
A year later, the Germans were opposed.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bayern - in the freight car.
That's how it turned the judge into an overfrequent lower village.
The training took place in Bamberg.
Manfred Richter had to go six times a week to the next train station with the train to Bamberg, there three kilometers across the city to go to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleeping opportunity in a red cross house in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a bedroom.
In 1951 he made the first and three years after 1954 the second state exam.
Since Oberfranken had no free education for him, he went to Oberbayern and attended the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Fraulein room" was his first "service" in the school house.
In 1958 he applied for a three-room service in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was purchased by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Peterhausen-Kollbach School Association and in Peterhausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were compiled in Peterhausen in today's Council.
When Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in place.
In order to get back to the lower school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Peterhausen grew up, and so the children and their teachers were able to relate to today's construction, which was extended to retirement from Justice in 1997.
Manfred Richter commends the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who also built a workshop at community expense and during the extension of 1997 Keller spaces, although it was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Citizen Master Götz was very school-friendly," the judge recalled gratefully.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the contribution of a government representative who had responded to a report from a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter asked what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two kinds: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to find out, "It doesn't always work." Whether he's just his students or his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Justices Tun was sometimes unconventional.
When the students were amazed, they did not get a criminal job from him, nor were they condemned to stay behind.
At the expense of the community, judges had two pair of boxing gloves set up and had the two opponents come up against each other, even if there should be a fork.
For the sake of the school, judges maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the partial judge after his retirement to apply in 1996 at least as the last on the CSU list for the municipality.
However, the judge was elected in six places and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 riders put in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Shoten intermediate stop
If Radler makes his tour in Bad Salzhhausen or Shotten Rast, it's nothing special to himself.
On Friday alone, however, the number of the Rastings impressed: The 700 participants of the h4-radtour as well as the accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower resort of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the free sky in the Scottish Alteburg park.
Under the motto "Radeling and celebrating on newly discovered routes between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and there lived a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was serious: The bikers took the first step, the 60 kilometres across the city to Bad Salzhausen and further to Shotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started the bike in Bad Vilbel, were welcomed by the owner of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of the body and spirit, all kinds of good things have been prepared: the rural women from Ranstadt and Lower-Mockstadt had 85 pale apple, Swiss, strawberry and cheese cakes, which were wonderfully served by the hummingbirds.
"Such cooks can only cook farmers," praised one participant from Aulendiebach, while he ordered another piece.
Cold refreshments could be created at the drinking state of the tournament gies-Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" hosted visitors with well-known melodies from operas and musicals and excited applause.
The beautiful environment of the park seemed relaxing.
In addition, a gentleman enjoys a head massage by his partner: "He earned it, finally he has re-assembled already run-down bicycle chains today."
Because of this, the mayor and the company manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the fountain in front of the drink shop by Reporter Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to shop in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
He also had a lot to do with on-the-spot technology since the first h4-Rad Tour 2004 as a tour guide.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated via three phones and a radio device with his employees and the 15-chop motorcycle staff of the Hessen police, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhein-Main area," he said, "but also from Gieße or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from many cities in Westfalen bikers are driven.
The number of participants depends on the accommodation capacities available.
In Category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II in collection accommodation.
From the resort, the bikers had a good impression when they broke up after a half hour: "Hello!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhhausen!" they won the divorce.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the bikers were required in the idyllic Alteburg park.
Under the management of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive environment and, of course, had prepared delicious cuisine, such as flaming cakes with well-cooled spring whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS CEO Markus Hoßfeld and MSC-Chairperson Wolfgang Wagner-Sach, in his capacity as member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen board, welcomed the visitors.
The three appeared to be pleased with the "many operations in bulkheads".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance scene.
The opportunity to move freely under free sky was used in spite of the sporty activity on the bike.
Among the guests were increasingly mixed with citizens, who had been made of the good spirit as well as the great scarcity of the bikers.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wättersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenk Forests - were on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of Radellns, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Thousands of Turkish police officers arrested for "swearing" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of "defence against the government", local media agencies reported.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the detainees are 14 high-ranking policemen, reports Hurriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested because they reportedly established an organised criminal association and had engaged in telephone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time the Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities of the Islamic spiritual Fethulla Gullen against him and others in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1st) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jasenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told the waiting journalists that not all schools had opened up again, but that he decided to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere in Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of school in Slavjansk, visited Jazenyk's daughter, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their next life.
The first day of school's new year is traditionally celebrated, where the children carry stolen shirts, hold balloons in their hands and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud fun scene from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Its career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., which changed it to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearsons' media.
She was president of the Financial Times for seven years and returned when Pearson's senior post went to a younger male colleague.
Its discovery was estimated to amount to nearly £1 million.
Her political ranking is solid, too.
She was recommended by David Cameron of Lord Browne, the former president of BP, when she sought out more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became a advisor to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
Already in May, I described the President's task with a poisoned Kelch.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust has a two-way effect: within the first garden of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This ensures a nearly unsustainable duopol that requires a comprehensive reform.
But what new incoming president would risk it, get in touch with everything, and deal with an institution that is as complex as a Chinese Dynasty, while he may be involved in his own business.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status overrun.
While competition is getting closer and new technologies are threatening old, comfortable security, the forthcoming negotiation of licensing fees for the BBC is linked to special risks.
For the modest sum of 145,50 £ per year, the British public is definitely the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pence per day.
And the BBC seems to rise again on the popularity scale: 53 percent now supports it, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone today and see missing programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very loved and attentive institution.
She needs a respected president - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that the substitute tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, included a derogatory comment on the democratic district attorney, who is at the centre of a criminal charge against him because of the abuse of official violence.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry's user account, which detracts from the previous one.
A tweet from my account was sent directly, which was not authorized by me.
"I don't buy the tweet and I deleted it," said the later message.
Employees from Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perry's official user account were out, it was not clear who actually was serving the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unfavourable picture of the district attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to tax in April 2013.
Perry introduced a veto against the financial support of her office when she refused to go back to what might be a charge against Perry - who might be a presidential candidate in 2016 - led this month in Austin before a Grand Jury.
The text of the Tweet reads: "I don't always go drunk with the triple-lethal alcohol level ... but when I do, I complain to Governor Perry when he explodes."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehberg's office was not entrusted with the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special state attorney from San Antonio, who was elected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the prosecution a political trick.
His high-ranking team of legal personnel asked the case judge to dismiss the charge and argued that the law, which was passed against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas, was unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state money at the State's Public Integrity Unit - which is located in Travis County and found in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to return.
This veto provided a public complaint from a left-wing Watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he had completed his fiveth presidential candidacy at the elections in Iowa during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry went on speculations that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself at Joggen near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley again explains the apartment market for "normal"
One of London's most prominent construction companies pointed out that the apartment market in the south-east of England was again "turned back" to normal level.
Homes in the capital were hot and the subject of huge price increases, which caused the Bank of England, due to the widespread fear of a credit blast, to set up in June upper limits on mortgage credits.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of Berkeley's high-class construction company, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal levels of transaction since the peak in 2013" and added that this offers a "sustainable business environment".
The real estate market in London was well established during the collapse, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the Kasteramt, prices in the city area alone rose by 18.5 percent last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales overall.
The average sales prices at Berkeley's private, price and student offers increased by about one fifth last year and were at the end of April by about £423,000.
However, a stronger foundation has made less attractive property ownership in London for foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "vilence tax" in front of the general elections in the coming May.
In the last week, the London real estate manufacturer Foxton warned that the mortgage market report for April, which presented more stringent credit arrangements, would lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in the sale of real estate and in the price.
New data from the Bank of England show a decline in mortgage authorisation in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, adjusted its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on a already weakening domestic price consciousness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now fallen by a quarter a year, says the manufacturer WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the wish for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amount for scheduled sales is more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result the sales of the term remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new own homes in the year until the end of April - almost one third more than at the highest level in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax profit increased by 40 per cent annually to £ 280 million, the turnover by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pidgey said that the revenues for Berkeley would be expected to meet current market expectations over the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to £450 million.
Berkeley shares stood at £23.96 on the afternoon in London trade.
Photo by Jennifer Lawrence published by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence attends the 85th Oscar award.
The Oscar Prize winner Jennifer Lawrence was released online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tributes of Panama" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and appealed to the hacker for "exclasting violation of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the photo-share page 4chan were reportedly obtained by a gap in the online storage system iCloud of Apple. The alleged "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not certain how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who see photos that my husband and I took in the private environment of our house years ago - I hope you're so satisfied with yourself," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, however, from the Nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and "Victorious" argues that there are pictures of her acting and tweeting "These so-called head pictures of me are GEEFELSCHT, people.
Let's fight the beginnings right now. *Word game is intended*.
Buzzfeed reported on the late Sunday that a speaker of Popstar Ariana Grande detracts the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly inspired new novel about love and the letter "J".
They collapsed, so you could best describe it, they slowly split up like a cardboard that was left in the rain.
At times, a woman told him that he was too serious, demanding, intense, distant and perhaps a bit fragile.
And then he shot his hand.
He knew Kratzbürst.
He was as stable as in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stiffness was a just beginning affair, which was more promising for a smoothing of his life's lonely life than any other, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailin Solomons was a brightly delicate beauty with unsaturated hair and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more distant and rough than the port of Reuben.
She had come with an older companion to the south, who held the cavern for her aunt, and who had inherited a piece of land in a damp but paradise valley named Paradise Valley.
For several years no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaky, in the baths were still spins, the nails had left their traces on all the windows and believed, they belonged to them all, and the garden was overgrown with uncooked, which looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house of a baby girl, both threatening and captivating, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced in the coming week.
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailin on the broken benches in the high grass and had enjoyed an unusually hot spring afternoon. Both had turned their minds away from the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and disturbing news, when the sight of its cross-breeded legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer who his father had listened to in closed rolls in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their pure aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not prohibited - Nothing was so forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolescenced, as the word obsolescence.
The general taste created what adoption and regulations had never done, and how people in books choose the Vom-Tellerwasher-to-Millionary Memories, Cook Books and Love novels, they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and sat large feet in a rough-combined series of Ailins.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"It was a famous song by a jazz pianist named Fat Waller," he told her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told me.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a Penny.
It was not a very funny game at the time, and it was not very funny even now.
He knew what was expected of him, that's all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Aininn had never heard of anyone.
Jazz was not played, even though he was not directly banned.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "when" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
Just like the mind.
His inescapability made the people nervous.
And Jazz was musically expressive.
Although he was 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from the half secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailin that Fat Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn’t remember a time when the pop singer was not black.
Again, no laws or obligations.
A consistent society meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of group surrender - grateful as those who were left behind by fate.
People with afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports by means of temperament and body construction, so sing and perform.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent, and cared for the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks destroyed Teller.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country as quickly as they did, were afraid to be accused of firefighting, even afraid that the flames would consume them as the next - had opened Labneh and Shisha-Pfeifen Restaurants, were concerned and were depressed.
Each one according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailin to understand how the hurtful words that the cavers had just spoken to her could be imagined.
Music was an expression of love.
"They are not really damaging," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never hurt anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the sad feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the dampening of the huge carbonic leaves.
Ailinn still doesn't understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was something unique.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She misdirected her head and blocked Kevern's sight.
There was nothing else to see around the world than her unscrupulous black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say so," she says without any conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're ahead of me.
They seemed to be really worried.
Are my feet too big?
He saw it again.
Your feet aren't like that.
Maybe your bone, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my bones are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick bones are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a bit of a pervert.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often encountered difficulties, because like his father, he did not have the soothing charm that one needed to describe the grayness inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailin Solomon was red and rose up out of her bedside, and the console was thrown down, and poured out the wine which they had drunk.
Holunderflower wine, so trimming was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, they seemed to scatter like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your dick is exactly why I feel perverse about you," she said.
Except I'm not.
She grieved him, both because of the unnecessary indifference of his words and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she leaned on him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern Archipelago where she was raised, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke down here on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and sadder than they had been as smugglers and beach robbers, were always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or lied to them.
Dickkopf?
They'd have shown her a fat faust if she hadn't been careful!
She first knotted - knotted was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the unsaid loveballads from the console - they first knotted and then beat.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the Knutsche itself was already an act of violence.
Ailin Solomon gave him a sign through her body.
He got up from the chair like an old man.
She also felt like staying, but she was surprised at the alertness of her grief.
That wasn't the end of the world.
You barely knew each other.
She looked at him as he was away - as from a room on the top floor her companion was watching him - a man, grieved by something that he himself had complained about.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bowed his back, humiliated, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was it an opportunity that she seemed to know, if she could not remember the only time she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailin Solomon looked at her feet.
A few years before the events just mentioned, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public opinion, worked on a short lecture on the continued violence at the low and middle level in exactly the parts where their reduction, if not expected, would have been in view of the money and energy invested in the eradication of that violence.
"It has already been done much, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to discourage the innate aggression of a people who have led thousands of wars and have won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically seen in spite of the high-question church towers between the hedges.
But some properties appear to be irrevocable.
The higher the church tower, the less the passion he continues to awaken.
The population weeps at the hearing of sentimental ballads, relies on stories about overcrowded difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of hierate and family life, yet not only does the former silence hold the rural communities as well as our urban garments stuck in the hand, but there are also evidence of the emergence of a new and sustained struggle at home, at the workplace, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to overindulgence," she said to the mentor when he had read the entire report.
I suggest you read less Romans.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme replied nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again Esme relied on her right to privacy and to refuse the statement.
Feminist?
Keep quiet.
"I don't ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a job without prejudice.
We serve a society without prejudice.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and commendable, may occasionally distort the results you have presented.
Obviously, they themselves have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "contained" and "roh", could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to focus on what it is like, if it happened, yesterday, it means taking the country's essential life.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED pen in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Onnow had given to the country in the last quarter of a century or longer.
Smile at her neighbor, appreciate her partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use her phone, talk to her, explain, listen to, agree to, apologize.
Speech is better than silence, the singing word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want out of it," Esme Nussbaum replied with a calm voice, when she was sure that her supervisor had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not as effective as we are ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may be able to find ourselves repeating the mistakes that only led to you when you did it.
This time, however, it is not the others we let go of our anger and our suspicions.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To show an English patience.
"They go too far," he said, "if you describe actions as "errors", which our grandparents may or may not have done.
They also go too far when you say that they would have given out their "wrath" and their "mistrust" to "other".
In fact, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past as in protecting the present, we do not speak of "us" and "other".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From the one, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme warned, "no part of society can claim to behave well.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what happened happened has happened.
That was then.
There's no need to say anything about it - we agree.
And just as there is no need to be blamed, there is no need to blame if such an arrangement is appropriate and there is a way to blame it.
But what is the past if we do not learn from it?
The past is that we forget them.
If I can say anything about it -
Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramids fall together.
"I'll think about her report," he said and let her go.
The next day, as she used to go to work, she was taken over by a motorcyclist, who, as passengers described, had gone on foot in a kind of "brutal anger".
There's a chance.
Lesotho-Military Member says that no state line is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho argued that they had planned a state strike against the government and said that they were going against policemen who were being targeted by political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and reported that the army of the country had surrounded its official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family into the neighbouring South Africa after reporting threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is no de facto state line, but the military reacts to the threat by "political fanatics", whose weaponry was managed by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defence forces acted after receiving several secret service reports that some elements were acting within the police, which actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were in the process of causing devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a revolution.
"Even if no one has claimed to have destroyed the government by violence, all reports agree that the activities of the Lesotho defence forces have so far shown signs of a state strike," he said.
Speakers of Lesotho's military told them on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating in their barracks and the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over governance during the absence of the Taliban.
Thabane said that he believed that he had become the target disco for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there have been great tensions since June, after Thabane's parliamentary meetings due to clashes in his unit government.
He said that his actions would not have been indefinite by the government, otherwise sounding charges of spite.
Production in the Eurozone at a depth of 13 months
The increase in production in the Eurozone slowed down in August at the lowest point of the last 13 months, as a study observed.
The final market purchase manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, at a rate of 51.8 in July.
An indication over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced outbreaks in a time of growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures shall be entered before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets are expected by the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a slow recovery of the eurozone and for threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that during this week, the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information on whether he is considering quantitative simplification for the Eurozone, according to those made by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become more evident," said Rob Dobson, the leading economic scientist at the market.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, the second largest economic nation of the bloc, France, fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as is the rise in Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism of Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer available, are also not reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to affect the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where SMEs increased to 57.3 at the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, CEO at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the sales manager index of the manufacturing industry in the Eurozone of August is that the sector continues to grow after that."
He added: "Producers in the Eurozone are obviously finding life quite difficult at present, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to result in some contracts being delayed or even cancelled, in particular major contracts.
He said that it would "always be more likely" that the ECB would finally have to introduce a type of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people from Czech militias were taken to a school in Beslan in southern Sweden.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that the world shocked.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had died in the classroom during the crash.
Just a decade after the sexual siege of the school of Beslan, where 334 people died, including 186 children, warned the heroic survivors last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatic Islamist terrorists children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new school year, caught and killed, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united the West and the East into Abscheu, and then suddenly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who died at the funeral in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will be persecuted forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that now visits Ukraine - and in the children as they die - will end now.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to get back into the broken school hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov, when she only tried to climb back into her underwear after a mine exploded.
Aida was completely confused about her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were kept dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me I was going to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at the time.
My legs were bleeding.
I stood up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a number of operations, she was completely healed, but yesterday she said, "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I have to operate again.
Some grenades are still in my knee.
Your goal now is to become a dentist to help people, as you were helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says belligerently.
"That's happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remind myself of those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my study and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the storage will always remain a part of her, although the memory of each year becomes somewhat weaker.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I look online at the photo of myself, as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time understand our disaster and contribute to that something doesn't happen again.
The boy who fled through the bullet hole, in the opinion, his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mommy told me to lay down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearful, she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a crying little child, grabbed it by the hand and ran through a ballhole.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son out in the arms, said, "Damir told me his mother died.
He said: I was not able to save her.
In fact, Tamara was locked outside and injured in the hospital, on her part, in the assumption that her son had died.
After her reunification she said: "I cry for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the recently dissolved News of the World) to receive the title of a Bernardo's Children's Championship by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to blow up in my memory.
I still know that I threw away all my toy guns right after.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these kids I played in court with, and they didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they're staying in the gym.
I remember very well on my trip to London, especially on the toy shop, where I was able to choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffer.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer under the horrors," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the Academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were just no children who could call and walk, and this silence lasted for months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London cried when I told our story.
I understand how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how Damir and I have helped.
I still remember what Damir wanted to eat Borshtsch and call all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with Kellerners in a restaurant. Damir shot his water gun at them and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I think many children have been killed and still killed.
They're just like our children.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they're tired or busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
Damir has grown up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he's not looking for Rache, he's not overwhelmed by the past horrors.
I know he doesn't like to remember that, but he has six close friends from the class and they sometimes go to the gym and burn candles there.
When he was younger, he put himself under it - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, the face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he left all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than I am, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I've been so sure for a few hours that he's dead and I'd never see him again.
When I woke up after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked at me, and saw the hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived in this hell.
"I remember coming to him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georgia Ilyn, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of Beslan's Greuel
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgi Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, right a picture of Georgi today
His blood flowed face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life while Czech terrorists shot down his class cameras.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbaria of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had left him for his first day of school before she left to go to school to bring her older son Vladimir.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not quite alone, there was an entire family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer you get to this date, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day on which we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's long ago, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are chasing me all over.
No one will ever forget that I promise you.
Invasive: The image of Georgi (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was perpetuated as a statue (right).
I remember that George wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to hug his teachers.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even this statue of crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like the picture, and it's hidden at home in the bookstore.
I understand that, but I also believe that people in all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgi says today: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they're investigating the collapse of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused him?
This world is going to be something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because when you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does it happen?
For ten years, there's nothing like that.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It's attacked my health, and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had some albums because of the siege, but then it got better.
Later in 2004, I went back to school and was afraid every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when the 1st of September gets closer.
I want to give my old childhood friend a tributa.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I won't let myself in.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and visited a medical school in Vladikawkaz.
I'll be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
Georgia Faniow, 20
The boy who survived, although he was caught at the foot of a murdererous terrorist
One wonder: During the siege, Georgi Faniev was caught at the feet of a murdering terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the spatula and sat next to the bomb that was stuck at the foot of a murdering terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel as if it had been yesterday," says Georgi, who wanted to go to FSB as a secret service officer, but this could not be done because of his health damage due to the storage.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I am older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that is not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and then actually felt something better, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time that I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I'll never go back there again and don't ask me to show you where I've been sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Faniow today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is unbearable and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I'm fine physically.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run right now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB's Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted to.
I have sent my documents, also the doctors, and they have answered that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to chickens".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know anything about it, and of course they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the day of the year gets closer.
I'm going to the celebrations to remember.
I know Georgia won't go.
It must be much stronger for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me. Here in Beslan are all drawn from it.
It stays in us.
Georgia is now an adult, but this horror is still in it.
It's hard to accept that if something like this violates the case.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He's been operated several times, he can run, but he can't drive any sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror by 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and this only strengthens my pain.
I lost a lot of people that I knew well and were more precious to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart weeps for the slain.
I know about families where new children were born, but also widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could grab and throw out all these rebels - as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was so attacked by a special application command in safety
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is being brought to safety by a Russian special deployment command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelty at all
The world began to breathe in 2004, when the baby Aljona was carried into the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty they kept their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back in the school gym.
Makhar, then three years old, disappeared, but Aljon's mother and sister died in the murdering twin.
Her father Ruslan has married again and with his new wife Svetlana a little girl he named Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and is raised to an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
They'll understand why.
Man accused of having overstep girls on foot in Fife
A 78-year-old man is standing before a three-year-old girl on a walkway in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of having attacked a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The charge states that Mr. Steward has managed his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and has violated the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, disputes the charge against the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC set up the procedure for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both have for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery case and other cases are closed close.
Place your camera on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have stage and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the damp underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many won't hit.
Point-and-shoot cameras do not normally have an LCD with which to compose images.
Even if you have an LCD, it's hard to see this under water, and the right picture setting is a lucky thing.
So you're doing a lot of footage.
If your camera has a row mode to make a series of recordings with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will be dramatically worse, as you continue to get away from the surface.
If possible, stay close to the surface when you make recordings in a pool, lake or sea.
This allows you to also bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is so much more important under water because of bad light conditions.
It is especially important if you work with an action camera: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changed things, even in a giant organization like the NHS.
As a consultant anaesthesiologist, he devoted his career to saving the sick, both the agony of the disease and the quality of the treatment.
Among his patients, as his wife remembers, he was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors were important in the diagnosis and disease, while the doctors were mostly dealing with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who started the path of suffering.
"I didn't feel it," he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble getting up.
While fighting with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was making his wife Juliet impatiently.
"I want everything better now than later," he remarked.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite uncomfortable and without reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct a X-ray examination of his chest.
It was only two weeks ago that he was skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray investigation was positive.
He looks at Mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest, which is the skin of the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is often difficult to determine.
While, for example, some smokers have had lung cancer, not all lung cancers have been former smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which once thought to be "wonder" but was now recognised as deadly.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is an illness that can be easily ignored.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos was no longer used in Britain since the 1960s when industry volunteered to stop using it.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - Klempner, construction workers, room workers and advertising workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, he seems hardly to be concerned today.
But this self-satisfaction is unacceptable.
Britain, as it seems, is now experiencing the height of a mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999 all types of asbestos were banned), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the geese of Mesotheliom is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
So Mesotheliom doesn't know any class boundaries, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bases, from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools, are no protection space.
Parliament's buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, we have already been created as the starting pastor of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a cop, either.
In fact, he found it difficult to imagine where he might have come in contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks as if in the tunnels at the Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years, there was a lot of asbestos." he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and pharmacists - use the tunnel.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer at least partially this question.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at the Guy's Hospital and who were sick at Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one who is still alive."
How many of us are still getting sick?
In Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long time of survival.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliocomb diseases die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us are still sick?"
The leading British expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Great Britain is expected to come to an end, a total of 90,000 of the disease will be affected.
Most of them still have no idea that they will die like this.

A brief view of the records of the courts, which are often applied to the persons concerned due to claims for damages, shows how far the mesothelimus hives are already spread.
In June this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, admitted to having been exposed to asbestos by Janice Allen.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagshipstores in Oxford Street.
Ms. Allen was only 18 years old when she began her work at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twins.
"Before this thing," she says, "I've never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought I'd be concerned.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers, not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today at far the most common asbestos found in buildings.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less deadly than other asbestos forms, yet it is considered by the EU and the WHO as a "high health risk" with possible consequences of death.
However, the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "it is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesotheliomers."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alami at the flagshipstore in Oxford Street, London, asbest
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
He presented a study of the subjects showing that "a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas without known exposure by work or at home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like nobody can get out of it to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government could have been unmistakably exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service cabinets and pipelines were contaminated behind Parliament's committees with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be picked up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace has received a "pure health certificate", it is unquestionable that 1 billion £ of work has to be put in place over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that, after the general elections in 2015, the MPs will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the Green Banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not maintained in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never accurately determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old abortion suspected that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places where you have worked and the data.
What he remembers is the day beginning December 2009, on which he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he was conducting an operation in the late evening.
Suddenly, I had a gunfight.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd make the ride home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pains of the chest, the skin around his lungs, were overwhelming.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors performed X-ray recordings of his breast and used Pleurakathether to extract fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sports activity and strong breath.
In 2011, a patient with similar symptoms came into practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now the relationship doesn't end with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened and his house doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, just two years after abortion had felt sick for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the ripple and the chest.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going on," he says.
To be honest, I didn't have to worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year's: "I was told that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had dates with Macmillan's nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (such as Graham Abbott often did), came in contact with the toxic substances with the highest probability.
Over several decades after the war, hospitals for the patients may have been life-saving but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still getting away today.
Students put their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and city halls because of its fabulous insulating and flame retarding properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have placed their bass burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently referred to on websites.
And for that reason, as innocent items have been included in our houses, such as floorboards or ceiling roofs, as standard asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in much of our properties," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact of a affected woman was the abbreviation of a garden spa in the 1970s.
So be careful how to wrap up your garden cups.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
The biggest difficulty was the change in perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was from all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very hard to take everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor "how long do I have?"
And I got about 12 months left.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas party.
That was then."
Mesotheliom is particularly domestic, because it is our life-saving mechanism - the breath itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is absorbed and the fibers are inhaled, they can be found in the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who changed to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.
That's exactly the hospital, which Andrew Lawson assumes it's exposed to asbestos, is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says Treasure, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well at Mesotheliom.
The effectiveness of an operation is, for example, highly controversial.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure won't.
"You can't cut out the chest," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Because cancer "does not speak very well of chemotherapy," the "effect shows", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there is a long-term survival," says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After he had contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consulting office four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he presented himself happily when he called.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott was offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months and likely extend his life for only one month.
"I was disappointed," he says.
I wanted to quit.
Lawson, however, managed to make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart specialist at the Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be referred, I just called and got a date," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the authorisation of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma diseases in order to experience the best available therapies.
But if these treatments are not necessarily failed, many people are concerned with another financial care - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in hope of forgiveness.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that a very low burden was also a health risk.
And here the company's legacy began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally contributed to their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full pardon", since Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesotheliom was due to an asbestos contact with the Guy.
After examining his death, however, a Guy's speaker confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the cellar area concerned in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesothelioma diseases that are trying to compensate for the fatal asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance claims may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the contenders.
As a response this year, there were significant new legislation that makes it easier for Mesotheliom-affected people to appeal for compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has set up a fund of £350 million for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012 and can prove contact, but cannot complain to anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 per cent of what a court could have referred to them in a normal compensation process - about £120,000.
Some 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesothelioma victims that £350 million represented a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not passed and mesothelioma diseases would find the companies and they could complain normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pension, added that the law was "not perfect".
But both penning and Morgan added that in view of seven deaths a rapid action is necessary every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December last year.
At that time Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect, contrary to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which long lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course with the most important," said Abbott.
That's what you always see in patients.
There's something that's gonna keep you going.
If you give up, it'll get worse.
Graham Abbott was involved in the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Post-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then in March 2014, I had a scan.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's life-ending.
Once again, Abbott studied six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumor is visible.
But the process is very physically and mentally demanding.
You have to think about practical things - about money, if I'm not anymore, for example, or show my wife how the boile line setting works.
If you get bad news, you'll be negative.
You have to look forward to it.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents, it's hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease that I wouldn't get old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very friendly and rude.
She told her friends about it and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was a detainee.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to do.
But for mesotheliomarks, such conversations are not through hope, not from a trace of hope to survival.
The disease (as well as finally for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a terrible safety.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China rejects Hong Kong Right to Government Election, Protesters swear compensation
On Sunday the Chinese Parliament decided, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong Election.
This action is likely to be accompanied by the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists led the planning and mobilization to this in less hours after the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders, in principle, to reject all non-peing faithful candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it does make us angry," said Legal expert Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The inhabitants of Hong Kong are angels.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, as Britain returned control over Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants to elect the government presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong's citizens have a direct right of choice, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership retains the process of a tight nomination committee controlled by Beijing.
After a new clause, only candidates "with love to the country and love to Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most effective protests in Hong Kong have taken place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shoot off the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine general right to vote.
On Sunday evening, within less hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy-Central followers gathered in the rain before the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement reached a new level of civil disobedience and they planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers announced that the movement "the establishment of the Central District has only been considered as the last means, an action to take only if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret having to say that today all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and the establishment of the Central District will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days and there were increased security measures, including police forces and barricades, on Sunday before the government building.
The unrest is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their city.
The growth of people from the mainland strengthens competition for products and services.
In addition, the fear that Hong Kong's values such as democracy and freedom of speech will start to crack under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central Movement, as it threatened the business - the Hong Kong liver.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they will last," said Legal expert Regina Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We don't want to worry that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investments.
The state-controlled Chinese media also reported recently on the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral rights involving 780,000 people - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school closures in the United States will now be transferred to universities where fresh appearances are offered with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this request and to offer the first luxury travel service in the United Kingdom for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a safety component.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to cut off their weaknesses in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
One company speaker said that there are no new bookings yet, since the service was just introduced, however, added that "Students would book the service in the coming weeks".
The company also informed that despite the study fees of £9,000 per year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do that.
The National Student Union, however, criticised the service as suspended.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the NUS for higher education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start this month with the study are facing a life-saving crisis, as the available financial assistance in the form of credits and scholarships does not take a step with the very increasing calculations for the simplest living bases before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving in the student home.
Feminists criticise race and police behavior according to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed in the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they were waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
After their experience, white feminist commentators place the gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Middle West increased and were observed throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned 100% around the race.
Compared to the responses, black women shortly after the shootings of August 9th came the personal essays with titles such as "Thinking about Ferguson by a white woman" and "Feminism not only turns around to suppress women" relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in feminism who are about the white and who speak privileged in such a high-class manner," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they must express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but are not considered as "women's themes" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," Mitchell said.
If I post something about how paints in their own country are being stored, the silence of ears is disgusting.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender problems.
For them black women have not had the luxury to separate the themes clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine the themes of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the murder of Lynch.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's right to vote, such as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for the right to vote could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to use women's right to vote, and the right to vote for black should come later," Hattery said.
When you remember such things, one with power will realize why white women do not trust.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it lasted for a decade until white women were organized against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flow of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a reflection of the time when white feminists played "fence" with the problems with which black women have been intertwining for generations.
"Would it not be great if activists who have the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to receive control?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who have built up their careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to preventative means now try to understand what this means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown was shot and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist of the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason for understanding one of the inherent dangers to the body - and opinions on the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will be introduced to the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectoral feminism, in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on racial issues in America are still surprising.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men, "are much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson are contrary to their earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police relationship to the black community is not the only problem that pushes into the background of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police attacked almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the south-west border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform is also back to the surface - this time as a woman theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-view of the topic as an essential woman theme they had to publish only the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of the labour visa goes to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a nest in women's organizations," she said.
"Sweine-House" in Ipswich stands for sale
The picture of a house standing for sale was removed from real estate makers, when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The free house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig that had prayed his head on a sofa.
Real estate maker Connells said that the pig on the photo was the pet of the owner.
"The photo, however, was mispublished and was removed in the meantime," said a spokesperson of the company.
In the exhibition of the house, Connells described the earlier assembly house as a "one-family single house with a bedroom."
Although the broker removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house in the social media was of interest, as some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW-City of Harvey houses a new millionaire after lottery winning
A Harvey lottery player this month
The search for a new millionaire in the south-west of Perth continues, with a happy winner who receives nearly $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday.
For the second time in five years, a newspaper disc in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the drawing of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the successful winner still needs to report.
The shopkeeper Steve Forward said that the win provides conversational material in the small town in the south-west of Perth.
The city talks about nothing else, and they're all pretty excited.
We thought such a win might happen.
Eight WA winners have celebrated win in the first division last month, a pay-off for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had achieved a few weeks before winning the megagamous $7.5 million.
The winner couple had played for twenty years and said that the win allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas Bat in the Gladiatorenarena
Not only were the gladiators kneeling in the match at the first Rheinbacher Romertag in the leisure park.
But the attractiveness of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who opposed the rainy and the autumn cold and remained unafraid of the historic spectacle.
There was a colorful rain of performances, performances, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their importance to the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighting force of the Gladiatorian school "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust fighting art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and sent his men to the ring in various gladiatorial contests.
At first, the "provocators" were on the line with rectangular shield and short sword as well as bows on the left leg and arm on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedari" with chest shield, short sword and root, as well as iron gladiator helmet, bone and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retianius", which came up against the "secutor" with tearnets, triangles and dolch, and after a short battle the boars came to the ground.
There the heavy metallike forces came together, the shields created, and the roots flowed surpassingly through the arena, that a fear and bang could become about the health of gladiators.
But the impressive "Summa Rudis", the muscular judge, had an ever-attentive eye.
"We wanted to relive the Roman daily life and make the culture of the Roman times a reality," explained Lorenzo Euskirchen, president of the organizer's "Friendeskreis Romerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, an "Oppidum Romanum" from the leisure park for a day was found, a Roman city, as Deputy Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
Finally, not only did the Romans bring war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous constructions that we admire today.
The rest of them were also to be spared on the day of Rome, such as "Aquädukt-Marmor" from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman canal bridge, which was just at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus society once faced water and energy supply, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of the times."
This also confirms the diploma measuring engineer Ralph Heliger from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented the measuring instruments of the Romans such as Horobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original Hypocaust, the heat-heating, which once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousand years ago in the footpaths of sound before they were burned.
In 2011, the Landesverfand Rheinland's Landesverband had dug out the rest of a Roman villa in the North Business Park in Rheinbach.
One found a wall covering an economic building with a door to dry grain and milling.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural good, explained by archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A series of finds from these excavations she introduced in a glass vial, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a zirical necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ until the Germans came into existence in the Roman Rhineland, suspected Morscheiser.
The children were also busy with the Roman windmill game, similar to today’s milling game, or they were writing their names on waxboards like the Roman students once.
At the stand of the Romethermen Zülpich, the children of the mosaics themselves were allowed to lay at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach Glass mosaics and at the stand of the natural centre Eifel Nettersheim serve a heavy wheat mill made of stone to grind the flour for a flat break or a müsli.
With the original stone car built by two cold flowers, the visitors traveled through the leisure park and also passed through the impressive state of the city's gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman project week".
With a Roman week from September 13th to September 21, the Watchtberg municipality will also join the Romanian-speaking Roman year 2014, which will be remembered to commemorate the death of Emperor August 2000 years ago.
Together with the Home and History Associations as well as the Watchberger Wander Association, the Association of Partnerships and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, among other things, are offered thematic walks, a lecture, cooking as well as guided tours for school classes and recall the Roman history of Watchberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire from his work on the nearby Watchberg is told, plants are presented as living monuments from the Roman era, and a funny lesson in people's understanding between a group of Watchbergers "Germans" and interested Romans.
The Adendorfer Primary School is dedicated to the theme of the Romer week project.
With the Roman week, the numerous, but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Watchberg will be made visible again.
In the Watchberger Rathaus a small presentation will be remembered at the end of the Berkumer Matronenheligum in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemics Charge West Africa’s Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are confused - and international companies go away.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to the West African economy.
The crop rotted on the fields, the mines are left and the markets are ruined - the virus has added to the region hard.
Some international companies have already gone far too.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," says African Development Bank chief Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the most affected
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola are on the market.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, alone the fever fell to more than 600 people.
Recently, the health authorities explained that the disease was carried out in every corner of the country.
In Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria too, the virus has spread.
In total, more than 1,500 people died, thousands more died.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies are putting down their business.
Foreign companies such as the Arcelor Mittal steel group withdraw their employees, several international airlines no longer fly the regions concerned.
Local merchants and farmers also respond: Only a few buyers leave their homeowners to get after-supply.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things, the coffee and coffee beans that are important for export on the fields.
The farmers don't dare leave their home for the harvest.
Foods are becoming scarce
"The people will always travel less," says Philippe De Vreyer, Pariser expert for the West African economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables is more likely to stay home.
The population therefore has to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food becomes scarce.
On the markets, the stockpiles of basic food such as rice.
At the same time, the region heavily dependent on international companies threatens an image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger was that international companies were basically hurting the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugo of the French Think Tank Iris.
Be determined how far and how long the virus will spread.
In the case of investors, the impression may arise that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus also to invest," warned Hugo.
The disease also places a burden on the state's state budget.
The disease also charges the state budgets of the countries concerned, which have not yet been repatriated.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be heavily offset by the high spending on the health system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to assist the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are already visible in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
Although the mountainous region in southern Niger has not yet been affected.
But nowhere else, many people are already afraid of getting stuck in the house.
Reservations in hotels also go back clearly.
Protecting her 50th anniversary
The association of patrons "Tannenwald" Bergau celebrates its 50th anniversary festival from 12 to 14 September.
At the Tannenwald Association, the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the foundation festival from September 12th to 14th were held on high tours.
It is planned on Friday, September 12, a large entertainment evening with the group "Dorfokker".
On Saturday, at 6:00 p.m., the big baller shooting takes place.
Then, in the big festive evening, it is with the "stoopfälzer Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle provides music
Highlights on Sunday are the Feast Service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the large party train at 2:00 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the federal and Gaussian.
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 festive ladies with their dimples.
Hard hat is the blasphemous Bergau.
The patronage has taken over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original term "schutzgesellschaft Tannenwald Bergau" comes from 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment through the exercise in room shooting and small caliber shooting".
The NS regime had triggered the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Just in 1964, 19 young men again met, who on April 30 in the Gasthaus Lukas, raised the "new" association of patrons "Tannenwald" Bergau out of the baptism.
Karl Marz and Adolf Ried led the Association as a gunman through a difficult start time when it was mainly about finding a club site and installing the shooting operation.
Already in autumn 1965, the association of defences in the "Leininger" gas house began with two teams in the round-combat.
In the following years, the sports shields, which were now organized in seven teams, were established in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records were held annually and the magical border of 380 rings was first reached by Rudi Meier in 1980.
As the performance of active protections has increased, so have the number of members.
After the club premises "Leininger" no longer met the demands of a modern protection association, then the board, led by Johann Reinn, decided to create a future home in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours on 8 May 1988, Pfarer Strasser granted the Church's blessing to the new protective rooms.
One of the major highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gaussies, associated with the solemn celebration of the new firefights in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Association of Protection celebrated its 30-year anniversary.
In 1995 a group of bullies was established.
Josef Schmalzl became a Böllerr referer.
A major challenge for the "Böller" and the association as a whole was the orientation of the 2005 Bavarian Baller Meeting.
In many hours of honorary work, last year the members of the Association have modernised the rooms and the shooting facilities in the Bergauer Court and thus brought to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in round competition
See also the sports services of the Association of Protection.
In total, eleven teams are currently participating in round-the-clock competitions: six air defence teams, one air gun team, one KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose in the round 2013/14 from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the GAU AMB) to the district league 1.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga North to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sport, events such as boxing, fascism and kingsball, club excursion and Christmas celebration have tradition.
This includes the protections at the feasts in Pfarrei and the municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident on return to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after placing his right forward in about 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that his 14-cheap team was disappointed, but now concentrate on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better use and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can make it better there.
Stewart had already gone to a wall early on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I have entered into a good result with quite good hopes today," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't fit."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the trailer and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart let three NASCAR Sprint Cup run down after his car hit and killed another driver at an ash train race in the north of New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in pursuit.
He returned to his place of work while an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. was being investigated.
On Friday, the authorities informed that the investigation into the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart must be charged with a charge.
The three-time champion was received with a great deal of surprise when he was presented before the race.
After starting at 12th position, Stewart was already in the first 10 years and was in four places on time.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs runs
Car with No. 18 out of control after the exit of Curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both of which drove against the wall.
Stewart went on, but he fell back to place 21.
Looking for a Danceful Teenage
Simply try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and leader Lisa Neitzel (left) are looking forward to the match.
Like many other associations, the jazz groups in the TV Jahn of the whole day's education are also creating the following schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups were severely dehydrated.
Now enhanced research is looking for a sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, a former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve years old, six in the group of twelve to 15 years old", says the 20-year-olds.
With more assets, the whole would make much more fun, "you could dance entirely other choreographies," she says.
Those who want to dance can take a day between 17 and 18 o'clock or Friday between 17 and 6.30 o'clock in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, unbounded in the training hours.
"Training starts regularly with a heating program," says the coach.
Then various choreographs are introduced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore through classical to sports and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, society is not too short.
"We also eat, watch dance movies, and we've spent the night in the dance room," Lisa Neitzel reports.
In the group you can close friendships, share a wonderful hobby, and still do a whole lot for your own motor development.
Whose jazz dance isn't like that, it can also sneak in in one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always tap into the education of children's dance/jazzanz, Bambini Ballet, Videoclip dancing and hip-hop on Wednesday.
The dancer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Anyone who is interested in discofox, slow rollers, Wiener rollers, rumba, cha-cha-cha and Tango can take a look and join.
Bulgarian prison warden protests across the country
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria have organized a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands after restoring their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher fees are also included in a list of claims to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Christo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting for a month symbolically against the new working hours and are calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of the prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
During the negotiations, the Director-General informed the BNR of the implementation of criminal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the Association of Internal Ministry staff.
Ukrainian Army has given up Luhansk Airport
In the eastern Ukraine, the prorussic fighters are still on the front march.
Following a severe battle, which allegedly also involved Russian Panzer battalions, the Ukrainian army has given up today, Monday, the airport of the Rebellenhofburg Luhansk.
At the same time, the army reported that seven soldiers were killed in the past 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had already brought personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top military leadership without mentioning details.
Airplanes fired by Prorusse separatists
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, prorussian separatists once again fired a fighter plane and two military helicopters.
About 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in battles in the Donezk region, according to the Russian agencies on Monday.
Coast Guard Ships Depleted
The rebels also claimed to have reduced for the first time two boats on the Ukrainian coast guard in the Asowska Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were landed on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a speaker in Kiev told the sender 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media were responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several villages in the area of Donezk were under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Ukrainian contact group is meeting today in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from Ostukrain should also participate.
In the past, all actors used their performances to make public their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia through the planned stations in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adhered to the 1997 NATO-Russia Council.
However, the NATO chief accused Russia of "a broken breach" of the agreement.
"Today we must see the reality in the light that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
From documents and opinions from the Russian side, "that they consider us to be opponents".
Increased NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
At the NATO summit in Wales, "Readiness Action Plan" will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have, according to official data, agreed on new talks to address their gas dispute.
The negotiations were set for the coming Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
A decision of the European Union is still pending whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
As a result of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not received any fuel from Russia for weeks.
Last time, EU energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had communicated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also suspend gas supply for Europe.
Europe refers to about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, most of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks Power word: Mouth will come "very clear"
Now the chancellor recognizes himself.
A free letter for all the complicated details is not.
Heartfelt concerns from the CDU against the Pkw-maut have apparently increased the CSU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, after persistent opposition from her CDU, has spoken a powerful word for the introduction of a Pkw-maut.
"To say it clearly: it is in the Coalition Treaty, and it will come," said the Party's Chief of Staff on Monday after meetings of the CDU bodies in Berlin.
On a detailed model, however, Merkel did not set itself first.
In the black-red government programme, "set parameters" are called.
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal, and it is now being developed".
The NRW-CDU, however, retains a wall on its noe on all streets.
Merkel also stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) has a constructive approach to the consultation for a draft law.
In addition, he spoke with Dobrindt about further opportunities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, such as broadband development.
"There's nothing special about it." On Sunday, Schäuble had left a "Spegel" report uncommented, his house examines its own concept to reward highway investors with mutiny incomes - after the 2017 election.
CSU Chief Horst Seehofer then warned about developing Maut concepts against the federal minister in the cabinet.
The CDU-Bundesvise Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The Coalition Treaty never came to the point of tackling all the circular and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU president.
In this case, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to talk again about the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU country associations Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
There are fears that a wall will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded that because of the mural criticism of the CDU series of coalitions.
The left sees the plans in view of the conflict in the Union as a failure.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said partner Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a Vignetten obligation on all German roads to start in 2016.
According to the Coalition Treaty, domestic car owners may not be charged in addition.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the wall over the Kfz tax.
The model must not prejudice foreign drivers under EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
One British woman said she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
It actually suffers from Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that missing diagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an insecure walk, and curved toes.
Sick people also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse with time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedrich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very bad survival chances.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she was 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who are 51 years of age today said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything lasted for a long time.
I was never able to ride with the other children's wheelchair or skateboard and was often held in school because of my type of walking and walking.
Rodgers said that when she was 13 years old after several operations to relieve her Achilles and stretch her feet, she singled out her medical records when her doctor had left the room and read that she was lying at FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I got the answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25 and then slowly lose all my abilities.
I made it all out by myself and planted my own fertilization.
She said when she was 17, she realized that she had not lost her abilities as strongly as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you've got it, otherwise you'd be in the wheelchair right now."
I think you've got something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT Awareness Month to pay attention to this disease.
Stabbsfeldwebe a. D. Berni Dieter has been working since the closure of the former training site as a fireworker
For almost ten years, the former training site in Munsingen will no longer be shot.
However, every month a deadly munition appears in the heart of the Schwäbische Alb biosphere region.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be pushed out of place.
An ear-bumping knee is held at the explosions over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen field, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since this time, the 6500 hectares of the large area is the core of the Schwäbische Alb biosphere region, which is open on 13 routes for hikers and bikers.
Tax load of businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax returns for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, so a new study published last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia paid together $27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8% compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The company's government and local tax burden increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent earlier in the year, and it was the third year of growth following the decline in the number of years 2009 and 2010.
Government taxes increased by 4.3 per cent more than local taxes, so the study carried out by the Service Agency Ernst & Young with the Public Tax Centre was conducted by a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's income comes from companies.
Virginia achieves by 28 percent the lowest tax revenues from companies.
A large part of the increase in tax revenue is justified in the recovery of the company's real estate values, researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 per cent.
While a large part of these gains came from large countries such as California, New York and Texas, the outcome seems to be also for the Washington space.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion to state and local real estate taxes last year, compared to 9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over the year.
However, the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues as the real estate taxes are running here on almost one fifth of the corporate tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to provide the same services that other States offer.
The most recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market alone
Business revenues also seem to recover, as is the case with the data.
Enterprises in the region reported income taxes in state organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland included $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is moving in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not increase in all three places equally.
The growth rate in the district corresponded to 4.3 per cent on the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported an average tax return of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has 6 percent in all three areas of office the lowest corporate income tax (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent and in the district at a relatively high rate of 9,975 per cent.
A comparable study of the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that lower government and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and a total of better tax climate prevails than in Maryland.
The district was not studied in the study.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5% next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the State's corporate income tax rate to 3 per cent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be getting better, so they pay more government and local taxes, as the latest study.
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transitional structure, which is organised by most small companies - in the district, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster rate of growth than the total company taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes are likely to continue throughout the country this year, with an increase in general VAT revenues for the State and local governments by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, the Washington space could be missed if the federal government's spending cuts affect the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hopping and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, broken in Frankfurt partner city Guangzhou - says the urgent desire of the officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery would leave in our city," said the vice-party secretary of the South Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting an SPD delegation in his city.
The official of the ruling Communist Party of China returned in the course of the discussion on this issue of the twelve million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, was one of the richest cities in China, was Li.
Therefore, people also have the purchasing power to make German beer.
The Hessian SPD Chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would be looking for a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joy of life," he added at lunch with the partyer in Guangzhou.
This joy of life has already dawned on Mr Li, he flattered the host.
After that, the officer from Guangzhou with Schäfer-Gümbel arrived - however, with red wine, which was served to the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewery.
Tsingtao beer is used after the German offer of purity.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-Partieichef Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012 it was for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the municipal politician was convinced.
"The trade between our two cities continues to grow."
At the moment, travelers had to take the route over Changsha to Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, the capital of Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The vice governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire in the forefront of his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," Schäfer-Gümbel replied - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate knowledge of Germany, agreed.
Maintained Partnership
Guangzhou’s world-class vice-president hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only entered the office this year after his predecessor had been transported from the office due to corruption.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against officials from Guangzhou is part of a countrywide campaign against corruption in party and administration conducted by Head of State Xi Jinping with hard work.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company in front of his career, which is most unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Prior to his entry to Guangzhou, he worked as chief executive in Fujian, where the autobuilder VW built a large work.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 km Guangzhou is one of those that are maintained by both sides, for example with a school exchange.
Last year the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis on the perflox is almost as strong as the whole Hessen with its economic strength.
The next year, they want to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, said Li.
Family of Joan Rivers "press the dams"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her arrival in a hospital in New York City three days ago; however, her daughter has shown hope today that the 81-year-old comedian recovers from her illness.
"Thank you for your ongoing love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a statement.
We push all the thumbs.
According to her mother, sources were delivered on Thursday after an emergency due to cardiac arrest at a hospital at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, at Mount Sinai Hospital.
The doctors are willing to sit down and carefully observe until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "nurst".
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners that come into trade today, more stringent environmental standards will apply in the future.
Like refrigerating cabinets and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from 1 September receive a label on which the buyer can recognize central data at a glance such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, sharper stick oxide values are applicable in the "Euro 6" class of pollutants.
In addition, there is more money for the gardener: they receive a US-wide minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information he had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a number of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement is surprising, not because no one expected to take over Twitch, but because it was widely assumed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was decided for a cool billionaire thing, and cooperation was also natural.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravor pieces in games, a "YouTube for Live Games", as an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre, in which the better-known (most old) games give an appeal of secret science theaters, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy, took something long ago, is an example of an established technical company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a challenge why the deal with YouTube did not happen, as the company reportedly was ready to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who explain that they prefer to drive sports than to watch, it is difficult to understand the attraction that is expected to see others when playing instead of taking the control console into hand.
It's one thing to look at a friend about 3 o'clock in the morning over the shoulder while she snores through Resident Evil, and something else to watch a spinner shoot him in the head 20 times in Call of Duty.
All these games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego-games, so taking away without your own control over the perspective can be a good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast-tracks in which the Roger Bannists of our electronic age complete all the games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is no game or humor virtue, his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics know about me?
Twitch is called from 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have just swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are being recruited as advertising customers.
Like the president of Twitch, Shear, Amazon and Twitch said, "both believe in the future of the game," and the media does not show signs of collapse, not even - hit - as spectator sport.
At the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest, a few people went off on Sunday.
The organizer's concept was correct.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday night, 1200 musicians came to the open air festival in the castle garden.
In time, the admission had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Saltweed l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words Maxim Sachari and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedel Burggarten is going to broadcast light on the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.
This was already shown on the early Sunday night when the first visitors appeared to open air.
A feast for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And this has succeeded them.
Around the supply points on the castle garden wye it had made Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearest and further surroundings.
They followed the first live performances, throbbing with the foot in the pace, enjoying cool drinks - short: relaxation was said pure and pleasure.
And that's what happened to the generations.
While a white sand swam on the tops of the beach bar, while others were swimming on a quarter of wine in the vineyard, the new growth fell on the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when making babies, the volunteers had to do all their hands in the true sense of the word to become the Andrang Lord and to enshrine fantastic creations into the small faces.
The bigger ones used the kicker table or participated in a skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot Crew of Salzwedel set up.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he pushed the visitors down, especially the families were looking for the width and the dryness.
But the attractiveness of the feast did not stop.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line."
Therefore, a repetition of the great party in the coming year is nothing.
Although the contents and size of the event still need to be worked, Sam made it clear in a first statement on Sunday against the vote.
He was angry that the entry had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company was booked with too little strength.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come to the site anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of some 1200 visitors who drowned in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The salt-sweet hip-hop band Blocks`n`Rox broke down its appearance.
The technicians were unable to create a half-way reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to saltweed because of a tire.
"But next year they will be there," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will be dealt with for the first time, but have to be eliminated for the second time.
Also in the social network Facebook the organizers must criticize criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier says on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you took over a bit," says El Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I think it's very good that some not only cheat, but they're also really trying to put something on their legs.
Hut off!", writes Stephanie Jens to the Amula.
Now there will be a year for the organizers to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Watchbergs Marks Shrinks
This is not what we expect.
Rather, the building is ready to be used in the remarkable building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the creation of the Space Observation Radar TIRA, the cave, the so-called Radom, is completely renovated.
The new radius will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
But the size still remains a world record.
The last step towards the completion of the new cave is the exchange of hats
The upper quarter of the old cave is separated and removed with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new vault is set up.
If the weather plays, the action will go through the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participants in the Ice Bucket-Chalenge are getting rid of Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain cried so much when her ice cold water was poured over her head that she violated the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket-challenge was painfully added.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she had cried so much at the Ice-Bucket-Challenge that she got rid of the baker.
Isabelle Roberts, from Britain, was so upset that her ice cold water was poured over her head that she injured her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did, my jaws remained simple," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is protected over 20 years old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't work out, the chef was tired, and then I realized something wasn't right.
My mother and my sister saw it too and almost got into the pants before laughing, but I had to get into the emergency room.
The 20-year-olds from Britain were sent to the hospital to reincarnate the quay after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Do the castles soon pull back on a string?
Finally, there was always a dispute between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereines.
Now, the governments are thinking about possible cooperation.
As an example for the reconstruction of the Wolfrathauser Burg, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former president of the Wolfrathauser Burgfreunde, launched the project in French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the castle and the castle friends Wolfratshausen.
The views on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauser Castle and possible reconstruction have so far appeared very different.
Now the two camps move together: There will soon be discussions on a common approach.
This is confirmed by the Associations Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burg friends) at our request.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we should be able to get together once," Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all members of the two associations could go back to a string in the future.
This is how to record more quickly visible successes.
While the castle friends were looking at Richard Dimbath, who suddenly died, until recently had a reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest, the "exhaustion and survival" of the site stands for the castlevenin around Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, the second president of the castle friends, was very pleased to hear about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he's been standing before the castle friend.
A new president will be found at a meeting of members in mid-September.
The club currently has about 40 members, according to 74 years of age.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the union activities rest in respect." This "dunk phase" was necessary to "think how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new president will then go to the conference.
Until then, the castle friends could also make a current mood within their group.
There is no candidate for the presidency yet, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He does not want to run for himself because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to continue working on the project "but very much likes to continue".
The different positions in matters of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He respected Dimbath as a "missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Through the high participation of the population as well as through voluntary aid from all over the world, they were a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at first.
But in the course of time, I have become more and more convinced that it is useful to advance the project. A "all-setting feature" for the city of Fößerstadt could be created.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitors tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"The idea of reconstruction is therefore not simply to throw myself overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein may move something at this point.
Their goal to document the story first is "important and good".
Then you could go on.
Clever ways to save on uni-teachers
Since the cost of single textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the student Matt Schroeder considered himself a smarter sparidee.
He created a rental system for books of students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the return sale.
"My math book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-file-A-Kek," said Schroeder, 19, visiting the Convention College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent 120 bucks.
The College informed the students on average that they spent more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and study materials, but there were various cost-depression options for the students.
Online shops and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of the choice for the students.
The rental of textbooks becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for a long time, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, reported that the rental of text books has doubled since 2011.
Investigations in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookstores were rented in the last spring semester, Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased from the National Association of College Stores, based on the statement of the National Trade Association.
Here's the one time for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books online cost only one third of the price for which they have to be in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler costs almost $290, but can be referred to the specialized bookstore Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy Used
If one does not make notes of other or normal uses, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate at Brigham Young University, says that he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold new for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors whether previous expenditures were allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest expenditure.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
The rental of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them in some way well, think about returning them and do not want to keep the books after the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a new book purchased.
For example, a student could rent "calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Please inform yourself about the terms of the business in which you are renting, including the criminal charges imposed on you for writing notes, hints or tracking.
Rented tenants: If you do not return the book, the penalties can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-Books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc...
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literary courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded for free today, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look at each other.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination in books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order you should check, as Gault, whether the book is actually available.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why didn't "Guardians of the Galaxy" become a cacher?
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollars budgets in the United States, while "A Lady to Kill For" played only 12 million dollars of his 70 million dollars budget.
The movie "Sex Tape" dedicated to Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children's films such as "sickly made 2" were also disappointed in revenue.
An article by telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that children's films may have a lack of quality in films themselves.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "slightly made 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, in films for an older target group, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compares the average CinemaScore and Metacritical rating for every summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and in the current year on at least 2000 canvas walls.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinematographers and film critics and pointed out that the film hits this year are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web-streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon appearing jungle book film, said regarding the Hollywood Reporter website: "I believe times change."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the current weak cash flow of Hollywood productions, netflix has recently achieved sales with currenting content of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as in the past year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
In the last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised the film studios for focusing too much on comics filming and in prophetic times a "cranberry melt" Hollywoods.
In the light of the present demise, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy could contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash battles expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply "cyclical" and said regarding Hollywood reporters: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinemacass, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
A few years ago, when the 2nd table tennis district class was removed for the purpose of punishing the lien unit, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German table tennis club has taken an additional 3rd federal league into the program.
The consequence: He who is not cut off is cut off.
Thus Göttingen’s top-class team Torpedo in the Oberliga-Religion has avoided the descent, but in the next season only plays five classics.
In spite of her great breakthrough to the regional league, Torpedo women remain four.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony league, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Langlers and the Torpedo Reserve enter into the new league, in which the country league are no longer represented by the Göttinger Clubs.
At the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Associationsliga, the Torpedo-second in the Landesliga.
What from the composition looks like a better district class is now the new districtsoberliga south.
Here are TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Enbeck, Hammenstedt, Topender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the district league they play as regional representatives Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of the TTC II, red-white, the upper SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district league of the ladies begins at least in the arm's length.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarhausen run in the district league.
With all nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district league staff of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Upper SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly established regional association, the two Göttinger circles begin with each of the nine teams.
In the West Staff are the Red White II, Topender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Millenhausen and SG Langlern II.
In the East Staff, among other things, Sattenhausen/Wöllmarhausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfhausen are playing.
The lady-kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarhausen II, Bilhausen, Heaven, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode circle, where there are no women's teams on cross-country level anymore.
Assuming that none of the six 2nd cycle reaches the strength of the sun, the innovative and circular board will have to think again.
Nato Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend there were protests of opponents of the Nato summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called opposite summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following us on the weekend and talking to demonstrators who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers from the Blue Mountains escaped
TWO young bus travelers were put in safety with the sail wind after they were caught overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
DAS 16-year-old girls and the 19-year-old man broke up to her tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govets Leap.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 20 o'clock when the two didn't return home.
A search team from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple were found near the Bridal Veil Falls at about 23 o'clock.
The girl had hurt herself on the knee and the man was upset and had his head hit.
Rescue forces stayed overnight at the couple, and they were evacuated on Monday morning.
They were delivered in stable condition with a car to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Scale government hostile protests in Pakistan
About 1,000 demonstrators were forced by soldiers from the PTV building, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
After a good half hour, the transmitter resumed the radiation.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said that the pieces-equipped demonstrators had damaged devices in the editor.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the head of government, which they are calling for.
The police reported that around a kilometer away from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence, it had come back on Monday to meet about 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
At the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to force Sharif's residence.
They request the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and using violence" on Sunday after a meeting in the Army headquarters.
It further stated in the Communication: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state".
The escalating violence has prevented the military from taking action, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have lasted since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif refuses a retreat.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers on Sunday to listen.
"We will not return without having forced Sharif to retreat," Khan said.
Qadri said something similar.
Khan proposes Sharif to have won the parliamentary elections last May by fraud.
Qadri calls for the withdrawal of central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are in use to protect the government area.
The demonstrators had first held peace before Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them at the weekend to press Sharif's residence.
Hütteldorfer after the second season victory on place three of the table.
With the 2:0 overgrave, for Rapid, a biter week on Sunday ended a comfortable weekend.
"The victory is very free," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team with the Aus in the Europa League on Thursday had reached an intermediate stage.
"The success experience was unmistakably important," confirmed Captain and Torschütze Steffen Hofmann, who presided in three positions with green-white.
Schrammel-Trumtor brings Rapid to victory street Rapid has shown with the second season victory the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a success experience into the country's game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said external defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his wonderful leadership volley of the sixteenth century in the 14th minute, defeated the softs.
"I thought I'd put all the frost in from Thursday and spit it under the latte," said the 26-year-old smile.
As a disgrace on 13 November 2010 for the last time in a federal league party, it was still for Ried.
The first championship event in Rapid Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm out of the Rapid aftergrowth," she said.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term beckons, shame turned from the left to the right defensive side and made his thing very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also practice this position mirrored.
The gate he earned, he has already made some assistants today," praised Barisic.
Team shows Character Schrammel also delivered the flag to 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour that finally made the decision.
Because before, the guests could have written down.
"Thank God we've had some luck today," said Shamel, who thus played on the interplay of performance and result in the past weeks: "The results have not been voted on, but the player was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that you had been "in many games before today" - against "the strongest team that played in this season".
The first three-pointer since 26 July has therefore proved that the team's outfit is intact to the contrary: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
No less happy for him: "That we have finally played again to zero".
Much work during the country’s play break The fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have had several occasions to regret, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their initial elvebüts, making the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget this," warned Barisic, who lost in the past three days with the Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately".
The country’s game break therefore had to be used to “luck the walls and attach a little in the physical area”, said Barisic, who has five U21-out-chambers in his series.
One who is likely to have a special break is Captain Hofmann.
He's breaking up for the team, he's going through pain.
Especially in this difficult phase he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before its replacement in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also reached the second gate.
For the 33-year-olds who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first match out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admiral).
Hofmann: "Don't think that everything is good now" "We must have had some luck too, but at some point the happiness has to come back to us too.
Now it was the highest time," said Hofmann.
He urged freely to focus on further work: "You can't always see it black and white.
We haven't played so hard in the last few weeks as this has been shown.
But we can't believe it's all right now.
He couldn't fight the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help at the moment.
They stick to me in certain phases," said Hofmann.
Grodig-Coach Michael Baur had little to do with his team.
He regretted the quick encounter "from the category of magictor", as well as the regular door of use in the 40th minute, which was denied by arbitration collegiates.
The only thing I can do for the team is that we weren't concrete enough in some phases.
There are too few conclusions.
Integral Maximilian Karner saw it similar: "It just started badly, but then we found out and even made a door.
There would have been more in the larger and the larger.
Under this carpet rest reigns
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle work of the summer series "My piece of Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these trees are still in the country circle, the illustrated specimen is the "Gießruheiche" above the underwhite fountain.
An easy footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak.
It goes past groups, basalt stone heaps and basalt stone lakes.
A piece below the stone break from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it rises out above the other trees of the surrounding area and remembers with a range of more than eight meters to an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree trunk indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intense research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bishopsheimer Archive and asked older people from under-white fountain to find out what it has to do with the fiery smoke.
The result of his research remained the rather nurturing statement for the name.
Thus, up to about 80 years ago, goats were to have driven their animals from under-white wells to the hard-rooted and rock-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the animal hats extracted from the rise were to rest.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because on the meadows it actually feeds on goats again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biospheric reserve, Schneider has further discovered.
However, when entering the stone collections, caution should be exercised, for the sun-heated basalt is also a popular place of residence for crusaders.
A trail leads from subwhite well to the tree, which is hidden.
Further paths are outlined, the direction of the high hall rises and invites you to an extended walk.
Where's the waterburg?
A water castle, however, which is sought for in our next task, is more rarely found in height.
The reflection in the tomb already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the countryside to which the building can fit.
Where is our "piece of Rhöner luck"?
My piece of luck Rhöner

After a week of baptism, Italian Prime Minister and official EU President Matteo Renzi passed on last week's nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, and she will become a successor to British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the government's next daily newspaper La Repubblica repeats, the calling of Mogherini, also in the Government's team as a favorite, to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes that he will bring the ever-increasing left party base to rest, because Mogherini will be assigned this - even more moderately.
Against the conservative representatives of the Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and of Poland nominated as President-in-Office of the Council, Donald Tusk, the dominant opinion in Rome will be made in order to create a political balance.
Because the EU's chief diplomats will also be the representative of the Commission President Juncker.
The remaining EU Parliament's approval is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would have referred to the appointment of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) as hardly a "significant recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that for almost two decades it has proved to be in leading party offices and that Mogherini, known for their pride, will grow to be the "abundant challenges".
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Their careers began in 1996 in the youth organisation of the then democratics di Sinistra (Linksdemocrats), which joined the Margherita Catholic Central Party in 2008 to the present Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Youth) for three years.
With the 2001 election in the Left Democratic Party, she joined the high-party policy, working in the Department of Foreign Policy, which soon became its leader.
She had traditional focus on Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO's deployment in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a troop quota, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Representatives, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his Foreign Minister.
If the PD again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which accounted for more than 40 percent of the party's votes at the EU Wahales in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share.
The maintenance in Brussels, which new EU foreign officers have too little diplomatic experience, therefore lacks substance, is reflected in the PD.
In Brussels, particularly by Poland and the Baltics, a distraught realistic accent of Mogherinis is being persecuted for the Ukraine crisis and defamated as a "russland-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to be transported directly to South Europe via Russian natural gas, as well as the Italian energy security.
After Renzi had become EU president in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first visit to Moscow.
The photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with encouragement, as well as they included the Kremlin Chief for October as a Milan economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-hanauer on Monday in Nabburg.
Among them is an Azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
In four training sessions, the new employees will be active in the future: electronics (three trainers), mechanics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All the Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neuunburg from the forest, Felix Domaier from Oberwiechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Preimd, and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees first visited primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all ages, as well as the trainees, go to a team formation event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees and 950 employees worldwide in Germany.
The number of trainees distributed over all years is 27.
Socialists in France should "keep the mouth shut and put France in order," said Francois Holland's most important allies.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist presidents whose cabinet formation has been disrupted by the large majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said in a big applause.
As a disturbing gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands after a lockdown of the regulation of the pages of Emmanuel Macrons, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his fellow Socialists to "join" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, turned sand into a movement in which she appeared at a meeting of disillusioned socialist MPs and criticised the Socialist party for taking the French "believe in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, ridiculed the constant pitfalls of the Socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would continue for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the Emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no, they are forced to form a new government if the old has not even survived a summer.
"And the new will also not survive the fall or winter," said Frøulein Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated her party's call after a parliamentary resolution and said that she was confident that she would go ahead as a winner in pre-elected elections and be ready for the government.
The ruling party in France suffered a defeat in the elections in March and the right-wing national front was at the EU’s waves in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of the French feel that the socialist party is at risk of falling into several rival groups before the end of the Dutch term 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Science Po University, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but the public opinion must feel fast that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise just ahead of a deal with prestigious cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruiser, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire the competitive prestigious Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its well-being, while it is in competition with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end in vain.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also holds a 20% share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo denied a comment.
The company in Miami operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenues in 2013 amounted to $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is totaling about $29 billion and is expected for it in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $ 850 million deal 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cross-country provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thai.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP a share of 8 percent in the company at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly have the original application documents for the exchange of prestigious cruises over 82 percent of the passenger capacity in American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A peking faithful group swam near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the election of leadership in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied by peking faithful members.
This decision will almost make it impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and caused pro-democracy activists to make their threat real and with "occupy Central" protests to put the financial square of Hong Kong to harm.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's leadership fears that the calls for democracy will expand to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, in which China's sovereignty over Hong Kong was represented in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organized a sit-in there.
Lis survey is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Zhang Rongshun and Deputy Director of the Office for Affairs of Hong Kong and Macaus of the Council of State, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the course of the day.
Student activists announced that they would meet in Hong Kong in the afternoon in front of the headmaster's office.
By the end of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain had no democratic elements.
Putin requires Kiev to take up "State talks" with Ostukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin requested Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government set up the fight against the separatists in the east of the country, and immediately took part in negotiations on the statehood of the retreating region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area under the control of the separatists would be part of Russia, but that his status vis-à-vis Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's appeal to the Government of Kiev to negotiate eye-high with the pro-Russian rebels, however, is in line with the strategy he had been pursuing five months ago: help for the separatists in the taking of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government in order to enable the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija to be truly independent of an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the state television channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recover the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow had denied the Ukrainian peninsula Crime on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the area as "Novorossija" or "Neurosland", a term that reminds us of the pre-revolutionary period of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the October 26th elections and during government groups, attack civilian communities in the areas held by separatists hope to "get caught in their illusions", reported Itar-Tass.
"We need to take up detailed talks immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of the society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to ensure the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to the statehood in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months to eliminate fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker for correcting Putin's "error" remarks underlined Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, contrary to the direct annexation of Crime, on which the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have a much greater difficulty denying the regions of Donezk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict gave a large majority for the rest of Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would empower the regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thereby giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory to Crime.
The five months ago the peninsula in the Black Sea is the home port for most of the Russian Navy as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
In addition, the regions between the Rostow region in Russia and Crimea are rich in mines, factories and geese, which make important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislation - after a new election - should be considered as additions to the Constitution, which would allow for greater control over their finances and the status of languages in the respective areas.
But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose weapons and uprisings are being proposed in Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level followed a further advance of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and panzers entered the former peaceful region along the Asows Sea in Ostukraine.
The separatists, supported by Russia, took over in hand, which, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Novoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations are needed to strengthen Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the peninsula of Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urgently asked for actions to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, an earlier Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are facing a point where there is no return any more," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take concrete action, and the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force when the Ukraine crisis is unspecified.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian panzer columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donez region last week to support the armed separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, reported on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers involved in the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paramilitaries captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko reported on Sunday.
Naked photocandal about Australian promises and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not make a cure for his troubles over hackers, who probably had stolen the head pictures of his engaged Gabi Grecko and a who is who the A-Promis from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of clear photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence in a hacking canal around Promis on the Internet.
The responsible hacker may have over 60 naked photos of Lawrence, star from "the Tributes of Panem" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevenne, the singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
From the Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were reportedly also public due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 promises on the list.
The most noble man who had committed himself to Greece last month said to the public, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, said according to a news website that the hack was "dangerous" and that the affected felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 images of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two photos in which she is located in a pool without a pool.
Among the film works Palmers are "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sugar Punch were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative Lawrence' said to TMZ: "It's a terrible breach of privacy."
The actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a phone is nothing but selling hehlerware."
Legally speaking, the distribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Wheelers, joggers and hikers were at the 8th wheel at the Grand Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the Association "Help for Cancer Children".
The tour, for which one was torture, was an easy training for the other.
But in one they all agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski should have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the chief of the Oberursel Brahause was riding the wheel on the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good.
He can easily hide the small muscle catheter there, especially the participation on the 8th wheel on the Great Feldberg for the benefit of the Association "Help for Cancer Children" (Frankfurt) has also brought him a valuable insight.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do this - fine!"
Small pousses on the way in the Applaus curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Upper Town Parliament, many of the 718 participants cried out yesterday in the early morning and came close to the invention, but happily on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier to cross the well 11 kilometres long between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The green politician from the Kreistag - red dress, red bike - at the start made a little bit more of understatment ("Every lot of professionals, there is the goal!"), but at the mountain he proved to be half a pro and went after 45 minutes without breathing through the goal.
He also went through the route in a rut, as did Nina Kuhn, a press speaker in the city of Oberursel, who had gone on his way with Frank Greeneiseen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporty challenge: "This is about Charity, where we'd like to go with it - we would have made an exit today without exception," says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) went down to Oberursel in the morning to immediately bend back to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung into the satellite at 9 a.m., "made" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
It was fun, too, "Friitten-Toni".
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, bicycle tours across the Feldberg are simply part of this.
He had pointed with his 6.5-kilo-wheel for 40 minutes.
It's a crazy thing.
For this purpose - here I am pleased," said Andreas Balzke.
The coached mainzer says he's an "an ambitious racer."
That's what he has to be, because he was on the way with the "Fixie-Rad", but these are also racing wheels, but without switching...
Not only did the 20 hikers who climbed up the white wall and the footstand to the summit, but also a jogger who pulled a car tyre with weights behind a rope on a rope.
Bergwacht-Doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, said: "I know him from Frankfurt, who trains for a special ski trail, only that he holds the skis himself." So the man is certainly his own skis dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - were sent to groups in the morning on the road.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
It was followed by the first riders and runners at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later the first mountain biker was released.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the "Radeln na den Großen Feldberg" Association, gave the initial commandos and wished the participants a nice trip.
For the next year, he hopes that it will be possible to block the route to Feldberg up to the safety of the participants.
