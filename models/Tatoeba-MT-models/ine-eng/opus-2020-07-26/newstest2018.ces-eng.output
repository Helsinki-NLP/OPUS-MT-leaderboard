The civil rights movement issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Benefit of Coloring People (NAACP) has issued a warning to colouring people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the discriminatory principles of the state and the racist attacks.
‘The NAACP travel recommendation for Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay more attention to the fact that the country is travelling across the country as a result of a series of racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the country,’ the Association declared.
The NAACP stated that this step had been taken on the basis of the current laws of the state of Missouri, which facilitate the defence of racistly motivated acts before the court, as well as the outcome of the proceedings of criminal authorities which are disproportionately aimed at minorities.
‘There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police just because of their skin color, are attacked or killed," NASA City Star president for Missouri Rod Chapel told Kansas.
"We have so far gathered the largest number of complaints."
This is the first warning of its kind, which the organization issued to the US.
Among the incidents that the organization quoted were racially motivated statements directed towards students of black spots at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a man of black spots from Tennessee.
Sanders died under the controversial circumstances at the beginning of this year, after he was on his way across the state and the police put him in custody without charge of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also points to the recent declaration of the highest state representative of Missouri, which indicates that black-face drivers have a 75% higher chance of stopping the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and employees before what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared - they should be able to drive money with them on any bail or warn their relatives that they are going to travel by state."
According to the current numbers of the FBI programme for reporting hate acts, hundreds of cases of hate behaviour occurred in Missouri in 2015, reaching sixteenth place among all States.
At the same time, travel alerts respond to the new Missouri Act, which facilitates the complaint of the company for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after the States approved an immigration law allowing state actors to detain people on the basis of a violation of this law, which is to improve racial profiling, according to ACLU.
The travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for foreign countries, but recently the legal groups have withdrawn from these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family doesn't even have peace after 12 years!
She's a model of Sally Anne Bowman murdered.
The girl from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixem at the restaurant where she worked, and she was wounded.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then he killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched a careful criminal investigation of the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years for murder and rape of Sally's model.
The judge only admitted a youth attack, and the lawyer claimed that his client had found a girl dead on the street.
After three years, the police testified to him.
Dixie said Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson had a bad night.
The killer said, "He was really angry and after his attack the girl started screaming."
"She even attracted the attention of the taximen," he said in a lie.
The girl was supposed to defend herself according to his statement, which she could, of course.
Lewis was gonna stab her on the street.
Dixie's version was proved a lie and accused him.
After Dixie confessed, he talked about his tenacity and taste for the girl.
When he had sex with her, he felt satisfied and had to burn his marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally was with her ex-girlfriend, they drank alcohol and took cocaine, he said to the police himself, Dexie.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so she attacked her back and put her hand through her mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family faces other attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
In the last half of the year, he was injured four times.
There are so cruel people on the loose who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," said the Mirror mother of Linda's deceased girlfriends about missing the watch with ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
The design vibrators are worth tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are neither priestly nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who operates the Prague Intimity store.
You'll find design and luxury erotic aids in it.
Including those from the Czech designer Anna Marešov.
It started unstoppable, about twelve years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went out for a cycling trip to Moravia.
One of them not only brought a bike, but also a box full of unsanitary vibrators.
"Various shirts and dolphins and all of them were green and yellow and just completely different," she tells me about the lunch.
His friend also decided to cooperate with the German manufacturer of Fun Factory's design erotic aid, which Martina was interested in, and he offered to help with marketing.
When the associate left for a different profession, he replaced it.
Today it operates in the Prague Benedict Street store Intimity, where it sells erotic aid in the way luxury cables or shoes are usually offered.
Why not?
It's also about design objects.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, you know?
Come on, don't be such a puritan!
It's just a Berlin Fun Factory shop, which proposed a renowned designer Karim Rashid, served for the Intimity store as an inspiration.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than everyone is used to here.
No hidden exhibits, all made in beautiful, decent style, products exposed rather as in perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeňk Šebelko began thinking about how to take up the Prague business where it should be and what it should be called.
The name of Intimity was popular with both of them.
"It's all about intimacy, and it's even, it can be said, gentle," he says.
She followed the purchase of internet domains and the search for suitable space, which went in parallel with various interior visualizations.
Finally, she won the variant that spread the store into the garden of luxury and the bedroom that leads the bed.
She was prepared by Dagmar Štěpán from FormaFatal.
We found the space in 2013.
He didn't seem perfect at first, because he's not on the main street, but that's why he's sitting on the name of Intimity again.
He's intimate.
He's in the street next to the main, so no one's looking at customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to do a trade that would be different, with brandy goods, in an environment where women who are mostly our customers feel good.
And not to be ashamed that they even entered such a trade.
When I walked into the Intimity store half an hour ago, the street wanted nothing.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I'd go to the erotic aid store.
At the door, I was immediately surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion shops.
Even if there is only a female service in the shop, so that women don't stop asking for help, it doesn't mean that the man's leg doesn't heal here.
Most of the gentlemen here are going to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men can't estimate the right size and prefer more," he smiles at the frequent mistake.
That's the kind of preconceived, the kind of cliché that women need some big help, and that's not true.
So a man in good faith should choose an extraordinarily large vibrator.
Even so, men prefer mostly black clothes, which the woman usually tends to pink rather.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face, it must be clear that I don't know what's going on, because Martin's just explaining how it works.
It's such a touchless clitoris stimulator.
Pere, I need a teenager to come up with a admiration for the serious tone I've been given.
It's like it doesn't look good.
And that's not really fun.
It's at a good price and has the perfect user reference.
We didn't think he'd be so welcome.
It's some kind of last revolutionary news.
The first revolution caused a vibrator in the shape of a sea horse.
He took care that women were becoming more interested in the design of such products.
The other one was a We-Vibe pair vibrator.
He completely missed the taboo that some men can endure, and that they see competition in erotic aid.
"Various variants are made," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
It's a favorite category.
In a loving connection, a woman may have in her hand a controller and determine the intensity of the vibration.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of attachment vibrators.
At least we have it.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, though they only need to use it externally.
However, in Western Europe, especially among younger customers, it is very popular.
What about the man?
It's hard to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It's probably a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin thinks.
"And we have help for them, but to a limited extent." Mostly the masturbator is sold, in this case from the Tenga manufacturer.
It doesn't look like anatomical vagina-like, but "is like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses heavily on functionality and experience in use.
In Japan, it's completely different.
It's a little weird in me.
I thought the Japanese would suffer a lot of erotic help, I'd say.
"It's the Internet reality," I'm told.
That one's completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aid is more linked to the use of women.
In Japan they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary they are taboo for women." Just for interest - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity shop, sells worldwide, still forms about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs aren't even smart.
On the contrary, we're a whole lot of people.
Definitely different from the country, such as the Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical customer of the trade is moving between 35 and 50 years and "already has some experience with sexual life, but with some help.
It will come for something nicer, more quality than a partner's life, or for itself." To get back, Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeňk Šebelko are making sure that each product is fully functional.
We also don't want to go into the specialties of bondage and latex, because we don't have room for this, but it doesn't seem to fit in here.
These things could reflect the ones we're trying to target.
Which are people who always had to go to the sex shop because they were afraid they'd see something like this on them.
Many of the products displayed on the shelves are really popular.
It is also given by choosing the designated marks.
Some of them even won design awards, including Red Dot Design Award.
The first award was mentioned by the sea horse "and it left a change in the whole sector.
It started to get rid of cheap materials and instead to work with healthly inconvenient, it started to produce different designs, different colors...
It is nice to see some of them standing behind the design of the Czech Republic, a popular designer Anna Mareszová.
I have to say that it was quite nice to be surprised how many people are with us that design stuff Whoop.de.doo from Anna Marešova buys, even though they're relatively expensive.
They're customers who're walking straight for Venušina's balls from Anna Marešova.
She really took a huge part of the work by representing exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids are able to do differently, nice, with a story.
Anna's story started as a schoolwork.
Now it's a finished product that's also made with us.
I wanted to have a production process under control and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are produced.
Because it's not about big production, but a small series, it's definitely more expensive than a large series.
Maybe I'm going a little off the line, but I think it's important to keep our development in the Czech Republic.
It could be that in a few years we won't be able to produce anything," Anna later described the situation, which agrees with Martin that our company is more open than ever.
He does not meet with a negative or a negative attitude.
It's the maximum number of people who are desperate.
"But you will then start smiling." Currently Anna Mareszová has a vibrator on which you can let yourself prepare a personal message, and this year she is also planning her own lubricant gel.
The next year should be the vibrating egg and other news.
Healthy Sex Limits
I wonder where the limits of what's right are.
Is there anything Martin Raj wouldn't sell anymore?
It's very hard to define.
What happens one day is normal, another can seem totally abnormal, so we're more of a product range of brand manufacturers.
None of them will be allowed to go into any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have the last question: What was the crazyst request they received?
Just this week, an e-mail came, in which some lady asked for Masturbation aid for her friend with the birth of a length of twenty-eight centimeters.
So we had to write that we had no such thing.
It's still a question of whether someone made fun of us," Martin says with a suspicious look.
And it happens from time to time...
It's Karl Gott's wound.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Szczedra is fighting a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend is fighting a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, it's unfortunately the truth," confirmed the sad information Blesk himself to sing.
I know about my illness, and so far, in view of the circumstances, I can handle it completely.
"I take medications that have the underlying effects of disease to slow down," he added by thanking him for his close support.
The entire developmental family was about to make Karl's life easier.
Eva’s wife is trying to be home as much as possible, after her father’s home on the White Mountain, and daughters from the first marriage of Zuzana and Teresa, the son of Karel, Karlas.
He fought cancer twice and passed his experience on to Slavik to support his demanding treatment.
He's got sixty chemotherapy behind him.
He managed to get back to work and to the tennis court and the ski resorts.
"From an astrologer, I'm supposed to be here in the '90s," said Karel Blesk.
He's a warrior.
He's still looking forward to singing.
"I keep singing words so I don't forget them," Karel confessed.
The same disease is fighting now in the constitution and the actress Flora Fial.
Do you have Alzheimer's patients in your family?
Look at how you treat him.
The Chilean Parliament has abolished the prohibition of interruptions, the U.S. law.
In Chile, there is an absolute prohibition of artificial pregnancy interruption, so it must not be carried out for health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have complained to the Constitutional Court and that ten people will now decide what we have agreed on in Parliament for more than two years," Socialist Senator Isabel Allende said.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and at the end of August it should be given a new president, which is, according to the AFP, a close opposition.
The Act breaking the absolute ban of interruptions initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, approved the Senate on 19 July.
The legal opposition then announced that the law would attack the court because it violated the right of an unborn child to life.
The Members of the vote on the bill postponed last month until it was examined by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
On Wednesday, the Members approved the proposal, and after that the Senate did so again.
According to the new legislative amendment, there should be no criminal interruption of pregnancy in three cases: if the life of a woman is threatened, if the fruit is not expected to survive, or if the pregnancy is caused by rape.
Similar exceptions existed, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, Chile, since 1931, before women were elected in 1949.
The absolute ban on interruptions in 1989 was imposed by the right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, only a few months before leaving the president's office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where an absolute ban on interruptions applies.
The following are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador, there are now about 20 women who are sentenced to up to 30 years in prison for their pregnancy.
In many cases, however, it was according to human rights defenders of spontaneous kidnapping, which the court had designated as murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The target of Trump's White House is now Socha Freedom
The unmistakable sign of change in the regime is the criticism of the soch.
The Americans could report on this as well as all the others - see the carefully scrambling of Saddam Hussajna in the Bay of Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of Trump's regime, certainly knew what it was about when, during a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acost on the subject of presidential proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigrants, he expressed himself as a symbolic anchor on Sochu Freedom.
It's a good thing Miller didn't attack the juice like that.
For that, he would be robbed by the fleet of shipowners and followers of Socha Freedom.
However, he attacked its importance, namely the fact that in 1903 a plaque was placed on the ground with the famous poet Emma Lazarus, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller praised Acosta for saying: “I don’t want to go to history here, but Socha Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light all over the world.
The poem, which was placed on the subject in addition, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he said himself, this isn't about history.
It is particularly about the fascinating words of Emmy Lazarus, who reason today - they call them not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go.
And in modern times we can better watch these "sick worms" on our screens than ever before.
Miller did not try to criticize poetry - he wanted to explain that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict on the importance of soybean is part of a vast political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict on the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends, who after her death tried to place a poster with the poets on the bottom of the soybean, knew quite well that they would be released into a high political game.
Socha was supposed to express the association of the French and American Republican governments by representing classical themes, that is, women's enjoyment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem there is not a female character abstract, but has its own voice.
He also has a very different name: Mother of the Outlaws.
Consisting with women's imagination is a brilliant feminist attraction and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the soybean, researchers have long been trying to reverse this meaning.
The famous commenter Rush Limbuugh - Jana Kríttel on Trump's approach to power - in 2010 argued that Socha Svobody does not actually call anyone to the country, but represents early neoconstructiveism, bringing American flame to the rest of the world: “Socha Svobody is going ahead.
He's bringing about freedom from the United States and offering it to the rest of the world.
The origin shall not shed light on the journey to the United States."
Limbuugh's shopping is in violation of the important thing.
The significance of the soybean depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the shooch from the sight of the exhausted and lost traveler, who often after a long and frightening voyage across the ocean comes with hope in the heart of a new country.
It is literally a world view of people who are looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, he expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that's, of course, a perspective that Miller or Trump certainly won't know.
Their origins should not illuminate the path, but spread hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship in the 2017 Athletics: Neil Black sings praise to the Scottish members of the British team
Elid Doyle recalls when the British team had only two Scottish members
The director of the United Kingdom's athletics federation Neil Black stated that a strong squad of 16 Scottishs in the World Championship team would be "a huge advantage for the team".
For MS in London 2017, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes was selected.
Black believes that in Scotland “something special is happening” and British athletes could learn from Scott.
"We are trying to understand this and adapt - we will work on it," Black said.
“I spoke to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athlete: he has something to do with what they did.
He's got people on the streets, too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will strive for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete with Sir Mo Farahem in the 5000 m race, while Elid Doyle was elected team captain.
“Eilid is humble.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
“Several athletes, whether Scottish or athletes of other nationalities, came from a room with great pride and motivation.
The attitude and unsolicited feelings Elid spoke to were unrepeatable."
The silver medalist Commonwealth, who will compete in the race over 400 m in his fifth world championship, stated that it is "incredulous", that in the British team there are 16 Scottish athletes.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
On the centre track, Muir has only set five British and two European records in the last year.
The MS will participate in the race at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scottish is Chris O'Hare, who runs a 1500 m track. This season won British team races and Annual Games.
Doyle remembers his first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of Lee McConnell's team.
The team's captain led to her being "very proud" to the fact that not only had a large number of her colleagues come to the team, but in many cases they would also be attacked to participate in the finals and medals.
"The extraordinary thing about the team's captain is that I was elected by the other team members. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was elected by the team is a pleasure," she added.
“I’m obviously very proud of all the Scottish who got into the team.
It proves where I moved.
They're athletes who'll think of the front seats on the podium.
What about my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I just pointed out that we can be proud of this year's championship because it's on home ground.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and be glad that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I've got a second chance to compete, and I'm going to have an unrealistic atmosphere."
Blocking criticisms on Facebook: don't worry about public function if you don't take criticism of wishes
Our father knew about his criticism.
American George Washington loved it, but the press didn't take long to start criticizing it for anything, starting with foreign politics and ending his political opinions.
Yes, this criticism did not leave her cold.
But he didn't try to silence his criticism.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "Freedom of expression can be taken away from us - and stupid and we will be led as sheep to defeat."
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan who needs to work on starting acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and reduced the contributions of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, she complained to the American Union for civil liberties.
The Governor's staff rejected the complaint as unfounded and many views of "who is interested" appeared in comments on the Internet.
"It's just Facebook," led many users.
That's what matters, though.
Especially when it's about people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, it is an extremely popular Republican governor.
It can be the second highest favorite of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not puzzling.
As you can see, his state manages with certainty its own and adheres strictly to principles.
It has also proved to be a turning point in Facebook's use as the main means of connecting with its voters - except there is no publication of the first photo with a bare head after chemotherapy.
Blocking people who turn to the governor's page - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by his employees paid by taxpayers - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In a discussion on Washington Post Hogan's journal, spokesperson Amelia Chase defended the governor with the fact that blocking comments had taken place from the post-moderation position.
However, using the image of Internet trolls, spammers or scattered people is too easy.
Washington Post told a number of real people who had their contributions erased.
And that is precisely what they are: real people who speak to their chosen leaders; teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, no trolls.
As they all stated, their comments were fair and considerate, not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani's lawyer, Md. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hate.
"I have just noticed that I am disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other current reports," the section wrote with comments from the Washington Post newspaper.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people have the same theme, some people are marked for the promotion of so-called collective effort rather than being considered a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's employees called "focused tax interest" would probably be called "obhajaboa".
Modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage contributions by blocking criticism or reducing negative comments.
It is much more comfortable than in the past, when the same procedure would require the sending of employees to the streets, where they would collect and burn all prints with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's going on, just in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure to be criticised for hacking Facebook and other social media.
President Trump faces a complaint from Twitter users that has been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
President Louduun County Board of Supervisors broke the first supplement in Alexandria, according to the periodic judge James C. Cachereise, where she banned one of her fans from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also received visits from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington’s time, the low price of mail was practically the same as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily prints was quaint and his position was challenged by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People who wrote under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valarius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote letters to the press and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents that gathered people in the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitioning his opinion about the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain were gathered in his offices.
But he didn't shut up.
Freedom of expression, disagreement and intimidation lies in the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.
More of their tariffs than at home are consumed abroad by Czechs.
Most often they move in Austria, but data consumption in the summer season leads Croatia.
On holiday, however, they have more time to fry on the web, and under the sun, most do not have the option to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathroom and smart phone in your hand.
This is the typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of domestic operators.
This results from the fresh statistics of the company O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available under the breaker than at home.
It is not surprising, therefore, that in Croatia, where the minimum number of insects is in winter, the consumption of data in this year's season has risen even fifty times.
In the second place, Italy was then placed in the data sheet.
The most minute Czechs are running from Germany, where many of them are out at work and in years.
According to the Czech Travel Office Association, Croatia visits 800 thousand Czechs annually, so is our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged a book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
The record was this July 7th.
"To the data transmitted, tens of millions of photographs would be included," explained details of the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslarová.
Even though Croatia manages the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighbouring countries.
In the first place is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for a walk and an active holiday, which we don't have much time for surfing on the Internet.
"In addition, through Austria, the Czech Republic is heading straight to the Adriatic," Cieslarová explained.
While the data recorded by the operator after the release of roaming fees for high interim growth, the number of phone calls is much lower.
The number of minutes spent in roaming increased from last year to double.
With a huge leap in front of other countries, Germany dominates here.
"Roaming is more used by business customers on business routes," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in the home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
The former Ronan Rafferty golf team will be hoping for the next three days in the atmosphere of the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, which hosts 25-year-old Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year on the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the finals, was under Paul Eales. This year he will play the role of Ambassador of the tournament in the representation of the founder of the club and CEO of Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club grow slowly in front of my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
"The players will be able to love the first-class quality of the game.
Jerry did a great job.
He's a fierce advocate of this game and he's proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hand."
The English Eales will first defend the championship title, despite the fact that during his 32-year career he won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"I feel good about it," said the Southport golfer.
“I had no chance to defend my victory at the Extremedura Open, because the tournament was canceled one year after my victory.
Returning to this part of the country is magic.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when for me and my wife Sharon meant a real victory.
It was a beautiful time I didn't forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour, returns to his home country after 50 years of celebrating this year.
This event will be his first participation from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like playing on the home ground," Orr said about Hellenburg.
“You want it to happen to you and then you feel a lot of pressure.
I really like playing again, and I think I'm doing it.
I'm happy with today's result."
Three players will also join the former winner Masters Ian Woosnam and the winning senior tournaments Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former captain of the Ryder Cup Sam Torrance competition are among six Scottish players on the field; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Access to the tournament is free. Parking is 5 £ per car with one passenger and 10 £ per car with two and more passengers.
All profits will be allocated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Maturity and Death in the Indonesian Country of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he's only rarely using a pony.
In its wooden chateau, located in the main city of Panai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply fits sweet potatoes - in the local word "note" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, let's take out some potatoes and taste it with your bare hands.
Bardina is sitting on a muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she is doing her daily work, such as washing laundry in a well from a nearby swamp.
The hair in the room without the roof goes to the bathroom.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned a field of treatment.
The legends are common here.
Work in the late hours of the night is a danger: most men from the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In the village there are also soldiers.
"In the afternoon after the fifth hour, no one will let himself wander around the village," said Bardina.
It is a rare view of daily life on the height of the pope, the former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum when only 1026 elders were put to the vote in the form of a public raise in front of the occupying army.
The current movement protesting against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakart government, which ruled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights observers.
In 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - the independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and deserted city, where you will arrive after a 90-minute flight from the capital of Jayapur Province to Nabire, and then a five-hour-a-half-hour cereal with a ride.
The collective transport is not working in this place.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo plots, roofs of woolen spots in the shade of gray and cutting colors.
There were only very few Indonesians in this place, but journalists, and virtually no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, the local people worshipped the God named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We were not used to wearing these dresses," says Bardina, showing her colorful, hand-woven turbane, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to wear only lists."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population live below the poverty line and the present child mortality and obesity is one of the worst in all of Asia.
At the same time, it's an Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold piece in the world of Grassberg, which owns Freeport McMoran from the American Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Panai - a rocked province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport spent gold and copper at $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports the worth of wood worth $78 billion.
However, for the Pope, these riches are a source of suffering and a guarantee of the removal of the powerful Indonesian army.
The investigation carried out in 2005 by the New York Times shows that Freeport paid to local military agents and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
The popes calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely oppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 popes have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, imprisoned, and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass killings in the Papui tribal area during the 70th century amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Indonesian police in the region.
In Will Lose Everything, a report by the British archdiocese of 2016, describes the cruelty that occurred last year, such as extrajudicial corrections, torture - according to another report is particularly popular rape and correction by electric currents - and brutal repression by peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims, because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harrison, an Indonesian research worker from the Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation has been hampered by the fact that the papal sources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are Christians, but demography changes with the flow of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
“Immigrants began selling chickens and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuan," explains 40-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Panai and moved to the capital of Jayapura.
"The natives of Papua - Momma (Women) - lost their jobs."
In 2014, Indonesia's President Joko Widodo, named Jokovi, promised to solve the injustice and violation of the rights in his presidential campaign.
The former treasurer has secured his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakart 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Panai.
But in Papua, this has changed very little, and local people feel hurt.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwio, hoping to hear our call for justice," you said.
The fact is that only two months after the October inauguration of Jacob, Panai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang the Christmas song at camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on the motorbike came out at night.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers took this hill and the one that was executed and later returned to the four other soldiers, introduced the local Pharisee Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in a subterranean state followed a group of children and left them with their weapons, led by victims and witnesses.
One of the soldiers then set fire to a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the construction of a nearby electoral committee and the next day things were still coming up.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered at the football court in front of the local police station and the military authorities and demanded justice.
They came with the solemn hunting ports and performed the Waita dance - where it runs around and resembles the singing of birds - the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants started throwing stones at the buildings.
With increasing tension, a command was issued to the soldiers via the radio: “If the crowd is tried at least three times against resistance, you are allowed to shoot”, according to the Times weekly, the content of which has never been published in local media.
Jeremias Kayame (56), head of the district of Enarotali Kego Koto, identified the danger and called on residents to disperse into their homes.
But no one had a clue about his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left armpit," said a week-old Time on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to his word, she belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people everywhere and a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, was struck three times, according to his cousin, who was a witness to the shooting.
"I was running to the body to make sure it was really him," said the Times weekly with a dull voice of John, who as many Indonesians uses only one name.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were only "insuring" the station that was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," said Pudi Sulistio, a press spokesman for the Papuan Police in 2015.
"It's a question of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many were expelled from the scene.
The murder report was filed by the Jakart media the following day.
About three weeks later, Jokovi gave a passionate speech to Jayapura and expressed his understanding of the victims' families and promised to deal with the violence in Papua.
"I demand immediate solutions to this problem so that it can never repeat itself," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of National Security, Wirtano, announced that he would introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve the violent acts that occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, they began calling for excuses.
“Most of the violent acts have been committed long ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we have decided to punish these violent acts, but it will not be a simple task," he said.
In an interview on 5 June for the TIME week that took place in Jakarta, Viranto claimed that he did not plan to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, it says that “all cases will be brought before the Court”.
Viranto, accused of "crime against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand dead during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, stated that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including an incident in Pania, had been settled.
The families of the victims of the gunshots in Panai welcomed his claim with disbelief.
"In the last three years I have been questioned four times, but I have not yet seen anything," John said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says himself.
"I'm afraid an army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Panais who are afraid to speak about the incident.
According to his words, he was beaten by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the body was buried, I started looking for an army," he said.
And there's no shooting yet.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighboring Deiyai.
In the event that one person died and 17 others were injured, there was a complaint between the villagers and the construction company manager, who refused to provide help in the transport of a man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of a building company.
According to the statement of the police, the villagers threw stones at them and their answers were a cautious shot.
Locals claim, however, that the mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the dove and killed one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of paying off," said the 29-year-old Domingg Badii, who lived near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of wounded.
"I haven't left the house in two days."
The Deiyai Parliament called for the prosecution of the police and the removal of the mobile brigade from the area.
The ladies were always staring in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the natives of the Mee, Mona, Dani and Damal tribes who live in central high places.
Many of them joined the Pope’s Liberation Movement (OPM) - the rebel army that protects the rights of the Pope by attacking and exterminating Indonesian police.
Some of the leaders of OPM come from Panai, not from Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the military's attacks, thousands of Paniai people have been arrested and detained voluntarily, all under the heading of "national security".
Some of them don't belong anymore.
Panii is known among the people of Papua as "a tragic and forgotten place".
Oil in the fires of poverty.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
And bread is as inconvenient as it is.
The people here are growing their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leaf vegetables.
Women work on the fields; each of them treats four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the landfills are intended for family needs, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes are only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began to flow to the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between the Papians and immigrants.
There are so few jobs that usually include more educated and richer immigrants.
The Popes rarely have the necessary capital and education to get them into business.
"Young people move from villages due to lack of work opportunities and money," said John Gobai, Chairman of the Panai Family Council.
Thanks to the isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
They also contribute to strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were kicked out of the pope for lack of cooperation with the authorities, despite the fact that they received such a rare admission to filming.
Phelim China, Asia's director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi, in his election campaign promised to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development. However, this has never happened.
"For foreign journalists who work in the most outlying regions of Papua and West Papua, there is a great risk: not knowing visas and entering blacklists," the statement stated.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesia in the cause of Papua is significantly limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - were ordered by the UN Human Rights Council on the investigation of "different and extended violence" in Papua New Guinea, including shooting in Pania.
These countries in the past also supported the OPM.
The Indonesian foreign minister Arrmanatha Nasir accused the press in Jakarta of saying: "In Indonesia, the democratic system and the media are still free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations."
Local people call after foreign governments have participated.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, in front of the human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people were running according to the source that also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, the password "we want freedom".
For 2019 there are other elections planned in Indonesia, but the popes claim that they will not vote for Jokovi.
"Jocka is a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people connected with the shooting in Panai," Gobau, Chairman of the Family Council said.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Panai - apart from living in constant fear of the plundering army - are fighting in poverty, poor education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the Panai people, like the other Popes, consider their voice to be "debt", which Jokov must pay.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and threats of the family of the victims of the Paniian shootings, they continue in the last symbolic act of combat: burying the bodies of the victims on the ground against the police and the army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least it will not allow responsible persons to forget their crimes.
"He killed a member of our family," said Yacobus with his head closed.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy caught a huge supply of cocaine in Australia.
The French Navy retained a 1,46 tons of cocaine in the Pacific, worth about $256 million.
The transmitter was heading to Australia.
The four-member crew of the ship, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested.
Jachta, named after Afalina, sailed from South America, and the police arrested her and dragged her to the port of Nouméa, a metropolis of the French eastern territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian reporting service stated that it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where and where the drugs were being directed and to reveal the "limitian union".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures which have stopped a large number of drugs targeting Australia," her executive director Col Blanch said.
Drugs were destroyed this week in Noumea.
Australia is an attractive target for its passengers because of high street prices.
The country is also facing the problem of increasing numbers of people suffering from drug addiction.
That's not the first time in the world.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting a large amount of drugs from the United States to Australia, which tried to spread across the Pacific in a small plane.
The elderly don't feel thirsty, drink they need to remember.
The problem may be in homes for seniors, according to a doctor at the Geriatric Clinic, the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavly Mádlovs could be an infusion of the physiological solution that sucks with a thin needle under the skin.
But you're still only being applied in medical devices.
The older the person, the lower the amount of water in his body.
"In addition, they lose the feeling of grief, so the seniors generally accept less fluid and they dehydrate very quickly," Mådlová said.
Two liters should certainly drink.
"But getting so much fluid into the old man is a big problem," she added.
In nursing homes, there are often no doctors who care about it.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually done by infusions.
"I think that there should be a gradual introduction, too, so that they can receive subcutaneous infusion," she said.
According to it, old people can add up to two half litres of physiological solution.
Lack of fluid may cause nausea, headache, and decreased performance.
Dehydration appears as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day that old man will say he can't get up from bed, he's talking confused," she added.
In the event of neglect, it may occur until the brain occurs.
Blood will clot and clot the nerve in the brain, also threatens renal failure.
The patients in bed should not be covered by a pen, which is the maximum of cotton.
The problem can also be one-time prey.
"It's the doctor's most demanding, but it would be ideal for the patient to occasionally discover and let the skin explode," the doctor said.
The Torch has already burned a second nightmare in Dubai.
In Dubai on Friday, one of the world's largest residents of the night skyscrapers was hit in flames. The Hasicians had to evacuate all inhabitants 337 meters high and 79 floors.
In the last two years, the second fire of this tall building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch (From).
All the inhabitants of the building were evacuated and there was no injury, the cause of the fire is unknown.
“We slept and woke up the alarm. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes before we ran down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Geroge, one of the residents of the ants.
The Dubai civil defence stated that fires were managed by fire under control around the fourth hour of the morning (0:00 GMT), which continued in the cooling of the building.
Government officials have added that they provide replacement accommodation for the affected population.
The incident could again lead to a discussion of the safety of materials used to build high buildings around the world.
From the results of the investigation initiated by the conduct of the Torch Dark after the fire in 2015, it was found that the most damaged coating and external panels used for decoration or insulation were damaged.
The British police stated that the system of isolation and siege of London's Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire at the red fire, with nearly 80 people killed.
The results of the survey showed that more than one of the five U.S. passengers carries prohibited items on board the aircraft
A survey among passengers showed that more than 20 percent of them were deliberately or unconsciously banned via the U.S. government transport security administration checkpoint on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers entered the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim to have found that they were traveling with guns, ammunition, or explosives.
The results of the survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which answered more than 1000 respondents - revealed that in younger travelers there was a greater likelihood of violations of the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to travel with the subject that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent of those traveling with several thousand hours of flying compared to less than 15 percent of the members of Generation X.
Among the most common items that have escaped TSA’s attention are food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents are aware of the acute issue, while 2.2 percent of the women and 3.7 percent of the men in question have also admitted that they were intentionally on board the aircraft for illicit drugs.
The company stated that it was carrying out a survey among passengers around the world to find out how many of them were accidentally subjected to unauthorised air traffic control and how many were approved.
It is not surprising that most people who have carried unauthorized objects - whether they are conscious of it or not - travel on a plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA directive is somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what fluids and how much they can carry to the plane.
It is not surprising, then, that TSA has had the greatest amount of liquid that is strictly forbidden.
For a certain time, people thought that TSA would place books in the same way as stuffed goods.
The transfer of fluids is allowed in foreign flights, not international.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on deferral of planned guidelines to reduce Obama's administrative emissions
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by fifteen states, her former head, Scott Pruitt, withdrew her decision to postpone the implementation of the plan by former Obama's administration to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt has introduced changes within his plan. It reacts so much more smoothly than previous governments have done to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge raised against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This applies to the last deadline fixed on 1 October when Member States should comply with the 2015 Regulation for the reduction of the ground ozone content.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement in one year and arrange for a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "disposals with local decisions or threat economic growth".
Pruitt, who, prior to reaching the role of Head of the EPA President Donald Trump, held the position of Attorney General Oklahoma, served for a long time as a reliable supporter of stricter environmental regulations.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or removed the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The emergency centre is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA had exceeded its authority in order to delineate Obama's administrative plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of the ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperation with States through complex processes and the implementation of new standards within the given time frame.
“The previous EPA administration often failed to meet the deadlines and waited for it to be appealed to by the active groups and others, agreeing with the alignment and further adjustment of the plans,” said Pruittt, who submitted more than a dozen complaints to the EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in regulation through judicial dispute and we take the deadline seriously.
We never consider our statute and authority that comes out of it."
However, the EPA declaration states that Pruitt may, at a certain point, use "the possibility of extension and all other legally available authorities", to ensure that the regulations "will be based on sound policy and the most accessible information".
The Republicans at the Congress press for a broader revision of the ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules at least by eight years.
The action has not yet been passed by the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was in the head of the coalition of states who complained this week of EPA, stated that the group was not going to allow legal pressure.
"To address the EPA's views - following our judicial decision - is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground ozone occurs when the normal harmful substances released by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and every year and thousands of premature deaths.
Public health advocates and environmentalists welcome Pruitt's sudden change.
"It is worrying what pressure it takes to develop to change the thinking of responsible people and to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight with the ideological quest for Trump's administration, which is trying to help polluters and special interests."
It's a man's policing acid, but it's not dangerous according to the court.
You never know what can happen to you.
In one moment you're at home with your family and you laugh, in the other, you'll suddenly change your whole life from base.
And the worst part is you can't do anything about it.
A similar judgment met with Andreas Christopherose from Great Britain, whose face was struck by acidic an unknown attacker who was finally released from the blame.
Information provided by web Reuters.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at Christopher's.
Andreas woke up to go open.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver the Christmas gift for the family that day.
Instead, there was a cruel surprise waiting for him.
A man he never saw in his life, immediately after opening him without warning, he said, "This is for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell on me like nothing, and I just felt a little pain in the skin," Andreas said.
His family quickly took him to the hospital, but his neighbors learned a terrible message - according to doctors, he had no chance to survive.
For several weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patients would be subjected to an infection that threatened to enter his wound.
His injury was very serious.
Of the 90 percent, a face was struck, which the doctors tried to bring together by means of skin from other parts of the body.
The loss of eyelids for Christopher has become a major complication.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today Christopheros has twelve operations behind him, which are far from the last.
The injuries caused by acidic attacks may require hundreds of surgical steps and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after a demanding and long-term treatment, the victims have tissue leaked for the rest of their life.
"Sometimes people don't worry and struggle with deformation and decomposition all their lives," said Professor Peter Dzewulski, a British oral association of plastic and aesthetic surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christophers is sure that an unknown man had to deal with someone.
In fact, Pachatel believed that the man who sexually abused his close friend was guilty.
The police searched the entire case properly and the attacker went after.
The man was initially sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict to the glory of Christopher’s family changed fundamentally.
"The three judges finally reached the conclusion that punishment should be abolished because a man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopher said.
Over the last few years, the number of fertilized attacks has grown significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior expressed its concern by planning to establish new guidelines for state representatives regarding the classification of cereals.
They should be listed between dangerous weapons.
However, the victims of similar attacks are not willing to give up.
They demand that the British government suffer more and more severe punishments of freedom from people who attack their surroundings with acid or other nutrients.
They also require enhanced controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often available in different shops, as they are different cleaning agents.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned at night a famous nightmare The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence, the residents of the 80-foot building managed to evacuate in time and nobody was injured.
According to the spokesperson, the Dubai police fired a fire on the ninth floor and spread it up.
According to a few people, however, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by the Reuters agency, fire broke out in the highest floors and spread down with falling burning concerns.
We slept.
He woke us up, people screamed.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes for the 50th floor," said the tenant George.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the flames had captured about 40 flats.
On the ground fire destroyed at least two cars when they were hit by a burning part of the building.
About two hours later, according to the Civil Defence Notice, a fire was able to get under control.
The cause of his creation is not yet known.
According to the witnesses in the surrounding buildings, there was a flow.
The vast fire damaged the Dubai mrakodrap The Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Nothing happened then, because the residents managed to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became its 352 meters tallest residential building world.
He was immediately prepared for the record next year by another dubian nightmare.
The culturalist had 14 incredible doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, in a sample of 30-year-old Ippolita, there was a stack of illicit drugs - from steroids through diuretics on Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, this wild mix didn't help him with the title, the fourth one ended.
Now culturalists are threatened with four years of distance and criminal harassment.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian ragbiist Davide Vasta was tested positively for 11 doping substances, which was a record number of athletes caught.
The third player started taking steroids a year ago, according to his words, when he lost culturalism.
Lucka Vondračková in Czech Republic.
She was really hugging her ex-boyfriend!
Lucka Vondračka has stepped into the territory of the Czech Republic, is in one round.
And he pays attention wherever he comes.
The last time she got into her former lover Michal Longhý, with whom she had lived for three years.
He was 12 years old at the time, and he was looking for his family.
Lucius was then only 19 years old, and she certainly did not apply to hang her career on a grave.
So they walked away, but friends stayed until today.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met for a long time.
Sodo's random, they both agreed to blue color.
At first, they didn't notice themselves, but then they got close, and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes when she fell in the belly.
Then they hugged and invited the photographers.
However, their meetings were not an accident, so they are playing together a charity couple in the new Primy Captain Exner series.
In Britain, the Islamists received their lives for the preparation of the assassination.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of the Islamic cell to live on the network, who were called Three Musketeers, and according to the prosecutor, planned a terrorist attack on the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom took part in the training camp in Pakistan and were previously sentenced to similar consequences, were arrested in August.
The authorities then thought he was going to attack immediately.
In one of the men's cars, security agents found a partially finished tube bomb, knives with inscriptions that in Arabic mean "unbeliever", and a machine gun.
It happened at a time when the MI5 Secret Service Officer was put in the car of a listening device.
"The recent assassinations showed how terrible the charges could be if they weren't stopped," the prosecutor's attorney Sue Hemming said.
Three sentences at the age of 28, 25 and 33 may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convicted person, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
The men in London during the trial declared they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car put agent MI5 in there.
The court also heard it, but then rejected the accused's claim.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 °C in Hodoninsk.
The internal temperature record of 37.3 degrees of Celsia remained on the peak for only two days.
From 38,3 degrees Celsius, which was recorded in The Watchtower in Hodoninsk, it was surpassed by Thursday, which has become the warmest day of this year.
This was confirmed by the employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Tuesday, however, not many temperature records fell on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records of 35 of the 145 meteorological stations measuring more than 30 years were exceeded or settled.
On Thursday, record temperatures were recorded for only nine long measuring stations.
The temperature in the Watchtower was perhaps the same as the previous 2013 record.
In the Lednica in Břeclavska on Thursday, 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four degrees and in the Inferences in Brnońsk the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three degrees.
Both records came from 2013.
In the West, it was ten degrees less.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly on the south and east of Moravia.
After the Watch Tower was the largest water in the Dyjakovici in Znojemska and Brodá nad Dyj nad Břeclavska, where the mercury was duly sprayed to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not exceed.
On the other hand, for example, in western and northwestern Czech Republic, the ČHMU web site has so far been the fourth highest temperature only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there began to grow until this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current weather in the Czech Republic will gradually decline according to the CHMMU, and more rains may occur on Sunday.
Most Morava sites, however, will remain high temperatures on Friday and in the south-east of Morava on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing's visa policy is worth billions.
China has been trying to apply its influence for decades without the use of force.
Each year, he spends $10 billion in support of language schools and the construction of universities abroad, pushes his entertainment industry into foreign markets and tries to attract Western tourists.
That's not what Peking's gonna do.
The state media is talking about the plan to make tourism a force for economic change and modernisation.
However, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8% last year, and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macaa and Taiwan.
This is done by, among other things, that despite all its global aspirations, China does not know the foreigner directly with open arms, evaluating the situation in the world's most native country professor of economics from the Beijing University of Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for everything is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have a wireless contact with China, citizens of those other countries must make a visa with a front.
The Chinese authorities in the United States are therefore comparable to the Chinese New Year's celebrations.
The visa is $140, but if a person does not want to wait for a long hour in front, he has to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions will create significant economic barriers.
Study Journal of Economics and Finance has shown that visa requirements reduce the number of visitors in the country by 70 per cent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which shares less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and lives there less than one percent of all inhabitants, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself by using tourism to achieve its political objectives, such as in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China in the spring restricted transport to South Korea under a break around the South Korean anti-coagulant system, the South Koreans paid it and China avoided it.
In May, the number of visits decreased by 42 per cent, while Japan recorded an 85 per cent increase.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report published by the US Central Bank, the Fed could release China as a result of China's foreign travels up to $190 billion, while China sells coins to tourists coming each year to about $35 billion.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion last year in tourism, which is equal to 44 percent of the total Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
Thus, a small number of tourists in a country that is anxious to prevent the flow of capital is causing a very painful wound.
However, the above factors are only one expression of the general sustainability of foreigners.
In many places in China, the fact that immigrants were virtually unknown has not been heard.
More than a million foreigners lived throughout China in 2013.
There are more of them in the United States and some individual cities.
And Japan, which is not exactly the crossroads of immigration, has a double.
A number of scientific work shows that immigrants usually revive economic growth, business and innovation.
But you can't practically find them in China.
To solve these problems will be politically demanding, but the step that is being taken is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian states, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently made a great effort to simplify and improve visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard coins, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Plzeň Zoo, mortally poisonous beaches were multiplied.
The Plzeň Kingdom I am able to enjoy the youth of three rare, deadly beaches.
At the exhibition, visitors will see only nine freshly born Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at a height of 2,000 meters.
"The length of the meter is even rising," said the spokesperson zoo Martin Vobruba.
The young of the other two species, mortals and cobras red, will continue to take power in the backyard.
We still can't tell when people will see them.
"We would hate to see them," said Professor Miroslav Dohnal, saying that it could take a year or two.
Australia's snake killers came into the world eight, they're descendants of a breeding couple from a population around Sydney.
"The only time visitors can see it at the exhibition is among the dead dogs around Perth," Vobruba said, saying that in human care it is necessary to winter 6-8 weeks at the temperature of 13 degrees Celsius for a more deadly winter.
As a percentage of the success was achieved by a dream of African swimming cobras red.
The couple in the pulsating zoo were cut out of four eggs, a total of four young people.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," added Vobruba.
This species in the wild injects poison on its victims, up to four meters away.
He's looking at his eyes, he's got a chance to make it up to the blind.
Young people of all three species live in zoo with mice.
Up to 40 days in the garden, they still expect the hatching of a black mother's snowflake, eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unconfirmed phone call review, Trump creates pressure on Mexico due to payment for the border wall
The American Journal of Washington Post published a review of President Trump's phone calls with leading representatives of Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone interview on January 27th with Mexican President Enrique Peñou Neem, Trump ordered her to stop announcing that she would not pay for the building of the proposed wall.
The American president told him that he was publicly judging the building of the wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like this in the press."
Trump, within his campaign, promised to build a wall along the southern border and announced that he would pay Mexico for it.
He also missed his first call to the public with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a rapid exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. refugee surveillance agreement towards Australia was "miracle" and "munny" and insisted that if he agreed with such an agreement - which had become President Obama's government - he would have looked like "medicated" after he proposed a ban on the entry of refugees into the U.S.
Trump ended the call after Turnbull explained that "this is my most unpleasant call of the day".
Tusk again spoke at the prosecutor's office for Smolensk.
"There's nothing to worry about," Tusko declared at the address of the brother of the dead president, President of the Government of Law and Justice PiS Jaroslaw Kaczyński.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski won't scare me," Tusk told the country's current leadership that he was trying to abuse justice against political opponents.
On his way out of the prosecutor's office, he waited on Tuska on TV 24 Daw, who was blackmailing Donald Tusk! and wanted a hundred years of politics!
Tusk thanked me for his support and assured me that he had a clean conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczynski won't scare me."
According to the prosecutors, he doesn't count anything, but he doesn't doubt that justice now has to serve the Polish rulers as a tool against the rivals, the opposition or people who don't like, and I'm afraid I belong to this group.
It's been a while since the hearing.
The Expremier was interviewed at the prosecutor's office on a number of occasions, this time he had an inquiry into the doubts about drinking the victims of the smolling disaster.
In addition, there was a replacement of the body in the skull.
The families were forbidden to open the shell and there must have been some reason for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of scandal, because it would make it difficult for Polish-Russian relations.
"Keeping good relations at all costs, despite such terrible events, should serve to make Donald Tusk a very important person in the EU," Kaczynski said on Catholic television Durvam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would put Tuskova at risk of obtaining the most important seat in the Union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczyn declared that he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Donald Tuske could have it different, but she didn't take it for granted.
Tusk has conducted an eight-hour investigation at the prosecutor's office on April 19th.
He didn't even speak as a suspect, just as a witness.
However, many of his inquisitors considered the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the head of PiS Kaczynski to discredit Tuska as a political rival in connection with various scandals.
The Prosecutor's Office is subordinated to the Minister of Justice in Poland, who plays the role of the Attorney General.
The appeal for a hearing came after Tuska's election by the head of the European Council, which Kaczyński tried hard but tried to prevent, among other things, the visit of Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusko's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán left Warsaw on the stakes.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs choose everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of a recording room from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
It comes from a statement that regulates the delivery of voting papers to the foreigner.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update and is currently in the process of recollection.
Four years ago, MPs were elected to ten thousand Czech citizens abroad.
"Since the latest renewal of the 2013 release, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry argues.
"In some countries, new representative offices have been created, some offices have been closed, and the level of representation has changed," it says in the material.
The notice shall contain two annexes, the first of which shall be provided by the representative authorities to which the ballot papers are delivered.
This group includes the Czech Republic's presence in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive the ballot card in print version.
It's their list that's changing.
Four years ago, the Czechs were able to choose for example at the Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
Czechs also cancelled their representations in Malagasy Bamak and Japanese Kyoto.
He won't even be elected at the Consulate General in Doneck.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in the east of Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Kenyan Nairobi, Senegal's capital Dakar and Zambian Lusace.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has extended its representation on the General Consulate in Iraq and the Czech Republic, the capital of the Chinese province of S' Čchuan.
Voting cards will also be available for registered voters in Czech embassys in Barmá and Cambodia.
The Czechs have had the opportunity to elect MPs in the polling stations in representative offices or consulates for four times.
Before any election, the national electoral commission shall, by lot, determine the country for which candidates are elected abroad.
This was the first time in 2002, when a decision was taken between the Yugoslav candidates.
In the following two elections, Czechs were elected abroad among the South American candidates.
In 2013, the Central Region was selected as it was this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is rising steadily.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 they were about 6700, four years later 8222.
To the early elections four years ago, 10,571 volunteers were delivered to the embassy.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists recalled racist lynching
Ford Mercury from 1948 traveled around the nearby inhabitants of Monroe, Georgia and flocked to the Moore's Ford Bridge.
However, before the car with four passengers of black skin and the white driver had enough to reach the bridge, a group of white men with weapons had built his way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a trimmed suit - came from a cigarette and stared at the front glass of the car.
Inside, the travelers were terrified.
"We want the n--a Roger!" cried the man.
"Bring him to me!"
Quietly break the nest of a young black man who is pulled out of the seat of a companion.
Luckily, this scene is just a reconstruction event that took place on July 22nd.
But if one of the men moves over the Roger's neck of the turn, the obstetrical will inspire excitement.
Since 2005, the Moore's Ford has been returned to the bridge regularly by a group of activists who rebuild it on the fate night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - killed members of Kukluxklan.
No one's ever been convicted of murder.
"It is surprising that in all those years no one person has been arrested - although we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," Tyrone Brooks, who helped to organize the reconstruction of the event, said.
"It's hard on our history and the burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a life-long fighter for civil rights.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to the event. Every year, the congregation of Monroe recalls that justice was not done enough.
"We demand judicial appeal and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," Brooks said.
"The process of healing and reconciliation cannot be initiated until then."
The judge covers one of the bodies of the lunatics at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI records received from the NBC News report, lynching was expected to take part in up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding periods.
But no one has been reached in court so far.
Although suspects remain for decades at liberty, citizens' rights advocates claim that both reasons of lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the city's inhabitants.
In April 1946, on the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court, the citizens of the state of Georgia won the first right to participate in the elections planned for the summer.
And right during the summer elections, according to the FBI, a farmer of black spots Roger Malcom had to beat the owners of the land of white spots Barnett Hester - allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, he was a traitor who took care of Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and brought her to a different state.
According to the FBI's statement, July 25, 1946, the then significant landowner of Loy Harrison's white plate for Malcolm's bail amounted to $600.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
When they returned from the prison, just before they got to the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects built their way.
"As it turned out, the murders were planned and organised by Harrison," the FBI explained.
"It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between state and local law defenders who not only participated in the lunacy, but also left evidence and kept the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks expressed himself more briefly on the whole issue.
"It was a massacre for election law," he said.
"The killings had a clear subtext for all the locals of the black skin: 'this is how you will get if you register and go to vote'."
The annual reconstruction of the event at Moore's Ford bridge is organised for almost ten years by Cassandra Greene.
Her performance is imageable, entertaining and embodiment. It shows deep-rooted racism, which many would like to see in modern America as extinct.
Looking at this reconstruction is not easy and it's more difficult to reverse the vision, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching, because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are concealed in each of us," Greene said.
"But there is no relationship between us if you do not listen to what I had to go through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June, and the first day about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of blacks - entered the room where Greene met with a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is running the position of the assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of Kukluxklan, but according to his words, the role was exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about it because it resists who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it is very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we will never want to come back to that time."
Dukes Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play the role of Roger Malcolm, the poet of Barnett Hester, play their roles.
The show begins with a tap - Malcom deals with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get out of my land n--e!"
Rascona doesn't exist.
He's on his way.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs at the most.
"What happened?" asked Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," says Greene's party.
"I just don't think the whites said "n-r" like that."
"Precisely," one of the players will run black.
"You have to focus more on R."
Energy in the room is all of a sudden better; hostility rewards the feeling of approaching.
All they want is to have an authentic performance, just to be done for four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time, Rascona focuses on the correct wording of the word to N.
No one's laughing anymore.
The performance ends violently and quickly.
Riv, shot... and found silence.
The woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings a sad song by Billie Holiday's "Strang Fruit".
Every word in the room is a feeling of sadness.
On the back of that, about a dozen viewers are tearing their way and tears out of their eyes.
There are practically the same number of blacks and whites in obedience.
One couple arrived from New York Ithaca, a lot of people looking at them from a nearby area.
Each of them has a local wet climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks leads them to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves in representation.
Until now, the murder could be seen with a retreat, but now, standing in the same place where lynching took place, the atmosphere is terrible.
In the final words of the song, the Greene will call on the team to inspect the bodies.
The children are kneeling to their victims' heads, watching false blood and impeccable bodies and whispering to their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy assures.
He'll run for a few minutes and Greene thanks for his obedience.
The actors are cleaning the wool and tearing their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head of Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascon will embrace his two friends-hers and the mourners will be in their arms; at last he will be filled with emotion.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that your role is coming to an end.
But you had a reason for that."
Later that same day, he meets the audience with the actor for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are busy talking about a presentation with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski has hardly found words that express her feelings from today's performance.
“It’s difficult to listen to those bad words and to look at the hideous effects... that people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said to the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still the current theme," she added, "only it's called police leaks."
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he was already planning a performance for another year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to endure - but it is also a moment of thought," he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know or study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it."
I love instructions for use.
One of my friends says that the instructions to use are read only by the smurf.
I don't agree, on the contrary.
It's one of the modern forms of art, and it's often surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember a long time ago, where the instruction to use anything was rather a raritious order.
So maybe my first gramophone contained only one paper on which were the hieroglyphics showing the involvement of some parts, there were some secret signs in all.
After years, when something went wrong inside, I offered that letter to a shaman who wasn't afraid of scratching his backboard.
He gave me a tip on what that paper with a labyrinth is suitable for.
Yes, it was the usual help in chronic depleting toilet paper.
He quickly found a wired wire and made it possible for me to listen to precious vinyl pies again.
The new age has brought new directions.
And a relatively simple fruit-depleting plant, where he simply held over the grep, demanded about ten images.
Especially mentioned was a description of how to insert one part into another.
The compound was double and another procedure just wasn't possible.
On the contrary, it required considerable effort with the necessity of breaking certain plastic components.
My rejection of the instructions ended at my self-movement of the Seat Leon brand.
The 2003 production year still had such a booklet with a reference to small corrections, which included, inter alia, the exchange of flashlights.
It was simple.
A total of three steps and the work should be done.
Unfortunately, the author reminded us that while the lamp went to the right, it was really only in three steps.
One, separate the cover.
2nd, blow out the flashlight and pick up a new one.
3rd floor cover.
The lamp on the left had a problem in the way of placing the battery cover.
At first, I thought I'd put the right upper limbs into the wreckage of our vehicle with some of the supplies, the screws, which it'll cover the easy to remove, and then I'll drive points 1-3 of the reliable author of the service book.
I don't think so.
The cover had no place, no space, no room for the silent hand of the Pope, but the medieval Slezan.
I've lost half an hour of my life, and it's completely without any success.
The state was still strengthened by my wife's entrance to the garage, which he called for a river and a word that from my mouth sounds quite exceptional.
"What are you doing here?" she asked herself.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I miss the vulgar terms, there were only two publishing words left.
I'm changing the lamp.
"Why is it taking you so long?" she said in a sentence that in a long-term relationship may be her last.
I slowly explained to her the problem, focusing on the torture process of the author's instructions, where the burning iron blessing on his hand, which he wrote, after her capture, was no longer written, was a mere introduction to the wide range of Kladiva's instructions to the witch shop, including his commissional fire at the top of the Losin Castle.
"What's the way to unmount that box?" the woman passed the battery's disassembly.
In absolute despair it came to this and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's the day my colleague called me, who was just in a collapsible state after two state medical offices were checked.
I know her as a well-balanced colleague who has lived in the field possible and impossible and who can also pronounce wild stories with unresolved voices.
"Present that I have received a fine for not having an elevated hand-washing guide," he told me with a weak voice.
I've gradually gotten out of him the whole problem that's got in the way that there's no picture of a hand washer on the patient's toilet.
His argument to the Commission's office that the adults wash their hands properly and that the need for pictograms to manage the usual activity of the decent people did not have an adverse effect and made it a little money.
"It's not just like that," she told him.
He understood that the simple dampening of the hand flowing water is a primitive act at the level of the chromium, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
So it's necessary to tell you that it's necessary to get out of a bucket of water.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it's a joy to find out that a man washed his hands exactly the way he's ordered a chudar from SÜKL.
Finally, I have to admit that I've let myself be inspired, and I'm preparing a detailed plan for the rest of the room.
In the case of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, in the case of drowned, given the difference between the two sexes, it will be necessary to draw up two instructions.
The problem remains those icons, for creating a perfect procedure means also the exact description of all anatomical details, which could trigger a certain recovery in the routine visitor’s toilet, since it can finally be learned that he has been opening himself up for the rest of his life with a very poor procedure.
Pearson leaves the next 3,000 employees and reduces dividends in an effort to revitalize the trade
On Friday, the British education group Pearson stated that it would drop another 3,000 employees and reduce the temporary dividend by 72 per cent in response to another restructuring programme with a view to changing the business model.
A further wave of release, which, according to Executive Director John Fallon will arrive at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, follows the previous decision of the company to release 4,000 employees in the framework of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs by another 300 million pounds (394 million) in May under the third programme to reduce costs in order to create a declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share in the Penguin Random House of Bertelsmann, stated that this year's outlook remained unchanged after it reported a one-percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide explosion
The suicide bomber attacked the military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul. During the attack, one NATO soldier died and several others were injured, the officials introduced.
Five soldiers and interpreters were injured, including NATO.
According to informal reports, three civilians died during the attack in the city of Qarabagh.
This month, Afghanistan was attacked by a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday during an explosion in the heroic compound.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In his statement, NATO stated that the Tuesday explosion had occurred after the guard was attacked with the Afghan army "local person with a built-in explosive device".
The declaration further states that all injuries of soldiers are beyond the threat of life and are located in the U.S. military hospital at the Bagram airport.
According to the rapporteurs, the increasing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the area of Qarabagh is a significant source of concern for NATO's joint forces in the near Bahram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people were killed in a car in the cabin of Shia.
The Taliban has signed up for the attack.
On May 31, he killed a major explosion in the city center of more than 150 people. It is the most deadly militant attack in the country since the US troops launched the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence is undermining such a questionable situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering an increase in the number of American soldiers who should help military units and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, suicide attacks have taken place, leading to the recent weeks of public confidence in the government, its regulation and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanín.
In response to the complaint, the EPA reassessed its decision to remove the smoking rules
The US Agency for Environmental Protection has revoked its decision to defer Obama's administrative law, which ordered States to reduce emissions, only the day after the Agency had complained to 15 States.
In the middle of the night, the EPA announced its decision on the adoption of the "Ozone Standards 2015" in terms of submitting the Agency’s commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will listen to their opinions," said EPA Director Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt notified the EPA's efforts to remove ozone standards - which measures actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and on the basis of the measures, the limits that need to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of the majority of democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., filed a complaint on Tuesday, arguing that the EPA is illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump seeks to prevent many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words, in an effort to boost economic growth.
However, the new government's efforts have started countermeasures on the part of the Democrats and the Conservative groups, who are concerned about the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA on its website states that breathing air with ozone content "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnár got a wound and blood flow!
Tohoto, with us a relatively new singer, you may already have registered in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer with us has arranged for the Czech monstrosity of the event to which he has hosted such leading personalities as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krain and a number of others, and the event has not been directed by anyone other than Leoš Marès.
The purpose was simple, public display and presentation of his music video to the song of Sara, whose baptism was sparked by the very name of the person.
Few people know, however, that the video clip itself, which took place in Russia, did not go through without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big film with the stars of the Russian national ballet and it didn't go away without a proper trap.
The song of Sarah is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramaticity of the scene, in the video clip, the singer’s juice was to mark the impact of the façade.
At one point, however, he struck him so strongly and directly into the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was the morning, I didn't expect it, right away, my blood dropped out of my nose," Ladislav noted the situation.
Colleagues and producers said the situation on the spot was an accident and Ladislav was unable to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so serious that it affected the continuation in another film.
We're bringing the young artist's video clip to you now, and you can also record the hit scene in it.
Undeclared blood version, but it wasn't better used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomačenko spoke at the meeting about the possibilities of mutual duel
Vasyl Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most recent boxing game in a light range, first met at the Tuesday meeting.
Each of them was located in a separate room in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia - the unbeatable champion in the lightweight World Boxing Council - went down to the hall where he welcomed the Lomachenka, the champion in the peerweight World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-way world champion, Adrian Broner, in a Saturday match at Showtime, both boxers got on the list of five best boxers in a light range.
Garcia made his way and said: “How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Her title against Miguel Marriaga on the ESPN is presented on Saturday at 19:00.
The boxers pose for the photographers and the manager of the Egis Klimats adds that the potential fight of the boxers would be a "perfect test".
"I'm an ex-gammon champion in a vampire vase," Garcia adds.
"Because of the Bronner match (67 kg), I had to take it, but I'm not that big.
I'm small on my 63 kg.
I'd like to go back to the category of light weight.
She's got to get back together to get her weight light... and then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Why don't they do it."
She agrees.
"A box would benefit from this game."
The climate required a payment for the survey - which is part of its strategy. The winner should graduate his debut in a light tie at the end of this year and next year fight with Garcio (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the game against the winner of the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who competes on September 23rd on the title in a light tie in the Forum arena.
"The attack should be carried out in the style of payment for surveillance, as the fans are asking," said Garcia, who later said that the possibility of sending a match through the TV station is open, which comes with the best offer.
“We are the main attractions.
No one else will draw such attention to himself.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia stated that he recognized the Lomaschenka as a "wonder boxer" and could participate in his Saturday match.
But she didn't give Garcia the praise when she said that the three-division champion from Riverside looks "very slow... sorry to Mike, but you're talking about knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show the strength and then the box.
Both boxers said they felt a rising tension in front of each other.
“You will not forget this game.
No other match is paying so much attention.
And I am very happy to put myself in the fire," Garcia said.

It's gonna be a great game."
A young couple 12 years ago disappeared without a trace.
Their cars have now been found at the bottom of Volga.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
There was extensive search for them, but without success.
And the police finally ended up for lack of evidence of investigation.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty, not knowing what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, a sad marriage of the entire story came.
Their car was hit by a leak at the bottom of the Volga River in the city of Cheboksary in Chuvashska.
Thanks to the documents left in the car, the police managed to identify a few.
The evidence survived a decade of water, without them it would take a long time for the police to find the identity of the found.
A couple were last watched when Zirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The sink that the car has discovered remains anonymous.
He reported his finding to the Czech police, who pulled the car on the beach the next day.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident that led to the narrow road leading along the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be published after its completion.
Latest results of tests for the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of asylum-seekers' trials in Sweden, which have been detailed in the new method of their age, show that over 80 percent of people were questioned as being 18 years old, but not all believe their accuracy.
Swedish Medical Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to assess the asylum applications more accurately. The measure was adopted after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to identify the right age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted a review of 6880 cases and the Forenz Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) was considered to be older than 18 years, while in the next 25 cases the forensics agency decided that the question was "maybe older than 18 years".
In the following 423 cases, it was decided that the question was ‘maybe younger than 18’.
Tests shall only be applied if the age of the question is controversial.
According to Johan Gøransson of the Forenz Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"On the other hand, the statistics are kept in busy circles last month and the numbers are very similar," The Local reported.
A higher number of asylum-seekers, whose age was estimated to be 18 years old, do not necessarily mean that asylum-seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that "the person concerned is 18 years old or older".
News Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases, he indicated that he was 18 years old.
Critics have also come across the medical method of determining age, which includes the X-ray of the teeth of wisdom and the MRI scan of knee joints, which are then respected by dentists and X-rays.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, is involved in assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age when the person in question went through puberty.
"I had reason to think about this issue and I do not think that these types of measures to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very insignificant.
If we can't determine the age with accuracy, we shouldn't pretend the opposite," Metro said.
The forensic medical agency Agency's Gâransson defended the decision: “In general, the risk of misjudgement of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is that the person in question is under the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all those in question."
Trump was threatening the president of Mexico on the phone.
American President Donald Trump, on the January phone with Mexican President Enrique Peň Neto, threatened not to meet with him if he would publicly say that his country would not pay for the building of a wall between the United States and Mexico.
Trump in the interview said that funding would somehow be arranged, even though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is the result of a review of the talks that the American Journal of The Washington Post published on Thursday.
Trump made building a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his last election campaign.
In the first conversation with the Mexican president shortly after the arrival of Trump Peňu Neta, he was not diplomaticly charged with being critical of his plan to build a wall.
The South Neighbor cured as a growing political problem and pressed the Mexican president so that he would not publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say that press," Trump repeatedly said in a conversation on 27 January and threatened to interrupt contact with the Mexican President if he continues to issue a positive statement.
Well, financing's kind of gonna come up with something, and eventually it's gonna work out.
"But if you say that Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to meet with you gentlemen anymore, because it's unacceptable to me," said Trump, according to the American newspaper.
Now he has identified the most important thing we are talking about, but politics may be the most important thing.
The execution order for the wall Trump issued shortly after the power was taken over.
Mexico refuses to build and fund a wall of 3200 kilometers long, which is why relations between the two countries have been compromised.
At the end of March Trump said the project would be paid by the United States.
Trump finally met with his Mexican opponent for the first time at the July G20 Summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's telephone interview with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on 28 January.
The head of the White House called the conversation a joke.
To that end, it was replaced by an exchange of views on an agreement whereby Australia would provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the acceptance by the United States of persons from international facilities in the Pacific States.
Trump first considered the agreement stupid, but later he came to it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the agreement you have made, but you will have to stick to it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passages, telephone conversations with Turnbull were almost professional, for example when Trump considered the good idea of Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in the boats.
"You're worse than me," called Trump.
But this conversation got out of hand.
"I hate the reception of these people," Trump noted.
I assure you they're wrong.
That's why they're in jail now.
"There won't be great people going to work for local milkers," he said.
In the interview, he also argued that in five years the fugitive could become an assassin from Boston.
Trump led at the end of January, about a week after coming to the White House, telephone conversations with a number of world citizens, often during a few days.
Turnbull's call finally made it the most pleasant one in the whole day.
Before he finished, he pointed out that he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin before.
Before the crowd, they fixed the killer rany.
Her father looked after her, too.
The repair took place in the capital of Yemen Saná.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose little Rana Almatari to live in his neighborhood for his sacrifice.
Al Magrabi kidnapped the girl, took her father's home, where he raped her and shook her with his bare hands.
Next, he raped her body, which then hits close to the mixture.
The violent death of a little girl struck the whole country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first row of a thousand-headed davit that met to become a witness to the correction.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was sentenced under the rule of the Sharia.
The victim's father communicated his feelings to the media after the repair.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I got it.
It's the new day of my life.
The other members of the family were present, along with the crowd, calling out the word "whether it is righteous".
The gunman in the square brought the police van he was pulled out of.
The police put him on the chest.
One member turned his gun against him and fired the fire from the immediate vicinity.
The present mob celebrated every wound that was fired.
Mr. Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice was executed in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and the right of the Shariah won," he added.
I was standing at the scene of liberation in Sana and waiting for my daughter's killer to be repaired.
Then we and our family went to the morgue.
We took Ranina's little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice was done.
The police were afraid that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into hate madness, the killer would fall and vilify.
The correction was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shiite Huti.
Originally, however, Magrabi was sentenced to 100 wounds immediately after his arrest, but his act sparked such arrest that the judge decided to punish him death.
Al Magrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on 27 June.
The early family knew him well.
When the police searched his home store, they found evidence that his husband was planning his actions.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to the wounded.
"Our family doesn't have enemies and the injury that took Ranino's body was terrible," said the media.
"The morning disappeared this afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all of our television stations, posters with her picture hung everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer parents who suspected their son of a terrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamilah, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body had been found.
In the morning, she was out playing with the other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we were looking for nothing.
The Yemeni people were executed and began to gather before the police station where al-Maghrabi was held, and to demand immediate punishment.
The representative of the Ministry of Justice has read the records of the investigation in question to calm them down.
The accused, according to all he did, did not express his regret.
Just before the execution of the sentence, the police read his sentence, but the convicted man was only looking at his rector for years.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were many recordings on the Internet that the crowd ordered.
Governor West Virginia announced a political change
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced on Thursday night at President Trump's meeting that he's going to the other side.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," the Governor of Justice said.
"Today, after a long prayer and reflection, I announce to you... today as a West Virginia resident, I say that I cannot continue to support you from the position of democratic governor."
The audience’s performance was a source of joy.
"I will join the Republicans tomorrow," the Court added.
"As a coach I can tell you, it's time to jump into another match."
Trump had already promised people an important announcement at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which is the only billionaire in the country, according to Forbes magazine, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large estate from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his property is estimated at $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening, which stated: "The move by the Governor of Justice is another morning for the democratic party that sets us up obstacles to the road rather than making a commitment to raising our country."
"For a democratic party, which has only 15 governors and has at least the statutory authorities in history, the Governor of Justice is the last step for such an anticipating party without a leader who is eager to find a positive and unified report," RNC President Ronna McDanielov stated in his statement for CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises the "right" apology of Russia for the doping scandal
Former outstanding sportsman Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for an honest apology for the doping scandal, but repeated that it had not been the right time for Russia to return to the sports world.
Russian athletes chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said on occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place in the pre-night MS at the athlete - that his country from the sport world was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who thus lost gold and silver medals.”
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban that entered into force in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) reported that Russia supported doping its athletes.
"I think we were witnesses today very honest answers and presentations," IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All members of the Council and Congress were surprised that Russia has admitted its error and is working from all strengths to repair and restore the proper function of the entire Federation."
Coe said he was also "enjoyed", that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think that today has been very successful and we have taken a further step, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff to maintain the punishment that has been imposed on Russia," Coe added.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate sincere athletes from those who are not sincere," he finished his speech.
At MS in the sport that starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes who have complied with strict IAAF rules will compete under the neutral flag.
The head of the crisis team IAAF Rune Andersen said Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before it is allowed back.
Tests on drug presence are still inadequate and the exclusion of coaches continues to carry out their activities, he told reporters in London after the presentation of the IAAF Council.
The Czech Trade State contract was awarded by Františka Savova, whose state is arriving.
The Czech Trade pro-export agency received a public contract from the Young Front of Františka Savova.
Officials gave him hundreds of points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind, however, that the Czech state was bringing Savov for tax fraud and asking for his release to Czech.
The pro-export agency of the Czech Trade Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued a public contract in April to provide editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal for the four-year period.
A total of 30.8 million crowns were awarded to the publisher of the Young Front of Entrepreneur Františka Savova.
However, in 2014, the Czech police charged him with tax evasion and brought him to death.
Savov fled to Great Britain and Czech Republic asks for his release.
For the case, the server alerted Current.cz.
According to the original CzechTrade criteria, the award was awarded at 60 per cent of the price offered and the remaining 40 beauty competitions, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion has helped the company of Savov.
According to Dotyk.cz, she received a hundred-point quality in all the partial criteria.
This was the result of the move in front of another candidate, the publisher Vltava Lab Media VLM, who offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated 404 900 crowns a month, VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it was obtained from assessors in all qualitative criteria by means of a mean assessment, a total of 62 points.
Tendru also participated in the consulting company BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which belongs to the same server Aktualno.cz under the publication of the Economy.
The VLM publisher has made several objections to the outcome of the tender by considering its assessment as non-ferrous and insufficiently justified.
Following their refusal, it was decided to attack the competition with the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition of the ÚOHS.
It is believed that the Czech Trade has acted in breach of the law.
"The proposer is convinced that the tenderer has reached a decision on the choice of the supplier of a public contract based on the drawing of a subjective assessment, a clearly favourable participant of the Young Front, a.s., at the discretion of the proposer and other suppliers," writes the proposal to initiate the management given to the ÚOHS this week, which published the server Currently.
According to the Director-General and the Chairman of VLM Michala Klima, the pointing of the election commission appears to be an incredible and pragmatic evaluation of the Young Front project by all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious," said Current Climate.
The Czech Trade has not yet expressed itself to the situation.
The Czech Trade agency essentially does not comment on public contracts prior to their closure.
All information about you is published in the User's Profile and the Public Order Journal in accordance with the law.
"After the end of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot express ourselves to its duration," said Dotyk.cz Media Representative of the agency Štěpán Dlouhý.
The young front responded by saying that it considered it extremely problematic that the publication of the economy had affected the article in Aktualno.cz in competition where it had its own business interests.
However, this fact was set out in that Article.
In the tender, she could help by providing the BusinessInfo editorial service portal in the previous four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Commerce led the Martim Kuba ODS.
Františka Savova blames the police for tax evasion in connection with the excessive tax rebate of his company, which has caused the Czech state a alleged damage to up to 770 million crowns.
Czech Republic has requested the United Kingdom to issue it since 2014.
According to Savova, the head of his criminal movement is ANO Andrej Babish, under whose influence the Mafra publishing works.
Last year's London court rejected Savov's appeal against the issue, but the businessman declined.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since yesterday, we have not received any understanding from the United Kingdom in the matter of acquiring the legal power of judgment to date," said Štěpanka Zenklova, a speaker of the Prague City State Department.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov was represented by the Harvey Limited based in Cyprus, which was owned by the Czech Buddhist brewery Samson, and by the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, purchasing dangerous assets.
He should also manage Heavy Machinery Services, previously Legios, who owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also linked to the extraction of property from some socialist youth bond.
The motorbike drove down the halls and the park, ended up in the quays.
The motorbike turned its attention to an independent road trip through the streets, pedestrians and park trails in Usochič.
When she began watching him, he decided to take her to the State Hall.
"Police men with increased caution followed the city when on one of the sidewalks behind the Marian Laznies failed to manage and took the motorcycle into the field where he was having a accident," said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
At last, he had to fly to a rescue helicopter who transported the injured motorbike to the Plenary Hospital.
The police subsequently found that the driver did not own a driver's license, the registration marks on the motorcycle were cut off, his production number cleared and his own product label removed.
It's possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is the subject of another investigation.
"In the breath test, the presence of alcohol in the driver was excluded, but the test found a positive result on the substance of methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How financial rules for football affect Neymara’s movement to Paris
The rules limiting the financing of European football clubs do not in any way violate Neymar's record transition from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which monitors European football teams and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Masters' League.
The Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 provide that the PSG will have to prove that the Neymar crossing was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid an invoice of EUR 222 million just to buy Neymara from his contract and Neymar will claim a fee of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
It follows several financial conditions of Neymar's transition to France.
Given that the PSG team is funded by a wealthy cataract family that has enriched its energy sales, it may allow Neymara to be introduced into such star football families.
Clubs may lose a huge amount to buy players, but on the other hand they have to show legal revenue sources, which allows them to cover the direct costs of trading activities related to football.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after reaching the Chair of the Director of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that were in the hold of the new forces ultimately cheated and risked bankruptcy if the banks or owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, FFP's rules redirected its attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and losing the winning sums for players and building a global brand - suddenly it wasn't so beneficial.
During the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs can lose up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor, Alexander Czeferin, was determined to defend the ban on excessive loss.
"The FFP rules are still valid and we are deciding to strengthen them in the future," said the Associated Press Andrea Traverso last week, who is monitoring compliance with FFP rules.
Although the PSG paid the amount for the purchase of Neymara in one-off payment, the amount may be distributed throughout the duration of the contract for accounting purposes.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be allocated to EUR 44,4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of the FFP's highest sanctions was won in 2014 by PSG with Manchester City, which owns Abu Dhabi.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million (US$ 82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and an order to reduce the team's league of players to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is paying attention to teams that can try to treat financial regulators by visiting their revenues through companies linked to the owner of clubs.
Even though the Turkish company sponsors the PSG as soon as financing exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the calculation of the amount.
A similar measure was introduced by UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funding provided by Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
According to some reports, part of the Neymar revenues in the PSG could be reimbursed by the MS organisation committee in the 2022 football team in Qatar.
However, PSG and representatives of MS 2022 in Qatar opposed the fact that Neymat should become MS ambassador in football and that such a manoeuvre would easily be discovered by UEFY actors.
The previous sanctions imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to comply with the rules,
According to UEFA's Tuesday statement, no investigations were conducted in the case of a Neymara crossing to the PSG.
The source of this report wanted to remain anonymous, since the situation with PSG is not allowed to comment, the Agency stated the Associated Press.
The latest published accounts show that the PSG closed in 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
The PSG expects the arrival of Neymara to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and sales of clothes.
The contract signing club promises an increase of up to 30 percent.
The representatives of the Spanish league, obviously concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to detach Neymar's departure, arguing that the PSG would violate the FFP rules.
"It is a clear case of the 'financial doping' club and the state," said President La Ligy Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG club as the cataract syndicate.
Arsene Wenger's Arsenal Manager, whose club owns an American sports magnet, shares the same position of La Ligy on financing the club.
"It is the consequence of ownership that has changed the football world from the foundations in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as the club's owner becomes the owner, everything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of the fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in participating such players in its club."
Spartan Deputy Russian: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand waving fans on their feet.
Tomás Russian is going to the square.
Same scene as Sunday's fight against Bohemians.
The Spartan lager broke up against the Red Star game, invented several heads, but his associates did not turn into black.
The summer team, powered by new multimillion forces, ends after the start of the two-thousand in European Cups.
Was it hard to do anything else after the Belgrade branch?
Four shots had to be fired after the incassated cap, which was hard for us.
At least we wanted not to lose, to raise our self-esteem, to reflect on what we had to do in other battles.
We had a chance.
We need to work together as a team and move our game.
Why didn't Sparta get in the fight that long?
The game's a hell of a mess.
The combination of the opponent was much better than ours.
We didn't get anything, we probably fired once in a while.
That's, of course, very little when you have to win two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponents more often into such positions.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the structure?
Of course, it's one of the pain when there's a new manhood.
We only played three competitions and the composition is still changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect unit that's sitting down.
Is it encouraging to you that you've already taken part in two matches after you?
They're still just parts of the game.
I don't know how my condition will develop and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that happened in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise it's not.
It's the same as injury.
If you don't believe it, you can't come back.
Sparta has decided somehow, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came back in large numbers, but they left in despair.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit again, as well as with the Goddess.
I'm terribly sorry that we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Bring something that'll make them come next.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here fifteen years ago.
Can the season without a cup be at least an advantage for the league?
As long as we're fighting ourselves, we're complaining, so it's not such a benefit for us.
In the case of extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur must stay for ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of the entrepreneur Jiří Toman, who had a considerable amount of tax to deny ten years in prison.
The estimated damage is 645 million crowns.
Toman claimed in his complaint that justice had violated his fundamental rights, the actual finding of the courts in Zlina and Olomouci are quite incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Courts identified the complaint as unfounded and found the CTC from the Court's database.
The U.S. is not another court of appeal.
"It is impossible, as a fourth instance, to assess the actual or legal doubts which have allegedly been allowed by the general courts, if they do not represent violations of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
Verdict has been valid since November 2015 when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouci.
At that time, Toman was in the publishing facility in Argentina, where he was, according to the resolution, also at the time of the U.S. decision.
The penalty imposed is a legal rate at the upper limit, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court referred the case to the extreme tax evasion which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
Man acted in 2005 to 2008 as Chairman of World Service.
The damage of 645 million crowns occurred only for the period from January to July 2008, and the total loss according to the expert exceeded the billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Toman in full.
According to the complaint, World Service did not include all the invoices in its tax receipts.
Instead of monthly deductions, VAT and consumer taxes in the order of at least ten million crowns paid tax in only statistics.
World Service and some of the companies with which the company was trading have relations with a company named Radomira Elector, whom the court has measured for the handling of VAT in trades with fuel goods for 13 years in prison.
His complaint was also rejected before the time of the Constitutional Court.
Summer to the Unhappiness Series and Comrade Detectives play on the nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for the figures of the famous 80s; for the dirty 90s (when genius David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the MTV comedy sketch "The State"); and of course for modern times, especially in 2001, before the stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd discussed major projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the embellishment of our modern facebook era of permanent memories.
From the French's point of view, it looks like someone's breathing.
The "First Day of Camp" series worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (for example, it can be a story of the creation of a talking box with a vegetable, which H. Jon Benjamin spoke of).
The authors turned away from the main funny point - the middle-aged players who are playing teen-accompanied children - and could not escape from previous events.
The continuation of “Ten Years Later” in which adults play not so much pressure on emotional balance and satire is places to sporadic, including parodys on thrillers from the 90s as “Ruka na colébce”.
At one point the character will be found at the Haraburdi Apple Powerbook, Wheelchairs and "a lot of other things since 1991".
Many main lines of history are repeated.
Mr. Shawlter, now writer, has not yet moved through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still panicking.
Not to mention a crazy puzzle involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which is promoted by George H. W. Bush (very well-contained Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of French is many side stories.
It is especially fun to watch forever young Rudda with long hair alias the character of Matt Dillon from the film Young, whose once respected character Andy is now behind the old paprika.
French could start the moments of random madness, as the series "Seven Up" should be returned, until it reaches what I suppose will be a logical reflection: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the final stage the whole group will be released at the premiere of the "Years to Survive".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon also appeals to another type of nostalgia: Revivalism of cold war series "Takí normalé americané", film "Atomic Blonde: No pity" and even the series "GLOW", in which the icons of the eastern and western Wrestling scenes meet.
The comedy of designers Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka in Rhyse Thomase's state is to act as a television scene: a drama by two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 80th century who fought for truth and atheism in the form of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the traditional Gregor and the idealist Iosef - are Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Street, which were delivered to the English language Channing Tatum (the efficient producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
In some jokes you smile (like policemen watching chess on TV - parody on American football).
The series lent its voice to many famous actors - between them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
"Comrade Detective", however, focuses too much on the unscrupulous propaganda drama - which includes a killer with a Reagan mask - and it also looks like it.
The six long episodes are not enough to break up and comedy moments.
At a shorter walk, a propaganda satire in Comrade Detective could work, such as in the scene when Gregor and Iosef visit the United States of America again, in which the two fats in the halls are packed with hamburgers loaded on a large crowd.
A clear message for imaginary communist obscurity is that Western culture can turn everything into a castle and an orgy.
The thinking of Romanian creators was not wrong: we do the same with our own culture, as with theirs.
The Russian athletes did not await the cancellation of the ban on startups from the IAAF.
The IAAF International Athletic Federation at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on the launch of Russian racers for the sake of a state-supported doping programme.
The vote in the history of the world championship, which begins on Friday, was very clear, as expected.
For the duration of the ban, 166 delegates voted against only 21 votes.
The main reason for the refusal is the fact that Russia is not able to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as established by the IAAF Rune Andersen, the Head of the Special Investigation Group, before the Congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have not been heard yet, and coaches still work in the country with a horrific history.
Not even Russia's anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the World Anti-doping Agency standards, is fully functional.
However, RUSADA can carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and British anti-doping agencies.
"Even though progress has been made, there is still much work to be done," said President IAAF Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic federation was suspended in November 2015 and Russian athletes thus came along with last year's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming MS, 19 Russians were involved, who had previously proved that they had been tested for a longer time outside the Russian anti-doping system.
At the championship, they won't be able to start in national colors and in the event of winning, they won't be able to play Russian anthem.
The Bank of England shall maintain a interest rate of 0,25 %
The Bank of England should, as expected, announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following a sharp economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has added speculation about rapid growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain "in the background" in relation to the maintenance of the interest rate - despite the loss of family budgets.
The policy makers of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Banks of England voted six times in favour of keeping the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the voting for the increase in the interest rate supported a sharp economic growth supported by weak growth.
In its annual report on inflation, the Bank predicted growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that family budget cuts would continue. The Bank expects inflation to rise by 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that over the next few years it should grow as a result of inflation caused by Brexit and also stated that the leases from the speech should increase more in financial markets than expected.
The members of the Committee also voted in favour of downloading part of the mammoth package, the task of which was to support the economy, which was introduced into practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, it should begin to pay from the next February the plan for future financing, which will offer cheap grants to banks, although the Bank of England has indicated that the planned $115 billion will now offer £15 billion less.
Just before the bank's decision, it stated: "The MPC predicts that a gross domestic product (HDP) will be stagnant from a short-term perspective with the pressure on real household income and the burden of consumption."
On the subject of the Bank's interest rate, it is necessary to "retract from the recent monetary policy" to calm inflation, which is "to a greater degree" than expected by the markets.
Markets are currently predicting first growth in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "solvent" and "limited".
The Bank reduced the forecast of growth for the year-to-year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% of the forecast in May.
The expected growth in 2018 of 1,8 % remained unchanged.
After the estimates were published, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $1.31 and by 0.4 % to €1.11.
The decision to maintain the current state came after the more disappointing growth buried hope for further growth - GDP stopped at 0,3 % in the second quarter, compared to 0,2 % of the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0,3 % in the third quarter, although by the end of the year the Bank should be slightly increased.
The latest report on inflation is an incalculable comfort for households affected by rising inflation and poor increase in wages. The bank has stated that the situation is worse before growth.
The report goes on to say that monetary policy cannot "stop" revenue reductions in the next few years, but it is expected that wages will "excellently" go to the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also increase due to the high interest in British goods due to a weak book, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer expenditure.
This decision came year after the rate was reduced to 0,025 % in August last year in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which led to a decrease in the books.
The Bank estimates that the full concentration of prices and the economy will last at least four years.
Prior to the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded a rise in rates with rising inflation, which further increased the pressure on households. Three political actors demanded an increase of 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2,6 % of June 2,9 %, although the bank indicated that such a change was expected and inflation should rise again during the next month.
The Bank stated that the overrun relative to 2 % of the target was "total" as a result of a weak book.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, stated: “Because of the recent drop in swap rates, it seems that competition on the mortgage market will only rise as soon as believers begin to compete for contracts with a good view of the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end up with existing contracts and repo mortgages - the offer offers are free of charge, as well as the low rates they receive in the form."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV treatment in 10,000 patients
From September, patients will have access to “transformative” treatment for HIV prevention on the basis of a decision of the highest court on financing NHS.
The National Health Service (NSH) announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is used before sex and lowers the risk of infection in high-risk patients up to 86%, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10,000 patients during the three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the appeal court supported the decision of the Supreme Court of last year, stating that NHS had financial resources to replace PrEP despite the declaration that the medicinal product should be financed by local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was taken by NHS England from Director-General Simon Stevens as a "significant intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a "deciding moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and will be fully implemented across England until April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine that is given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
The tests showed that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of transmission of HIV among the patients at risk.
PreEP before sex means that there is sufficient amount of specific medicines to prevent infection in the patient’s body.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Among the patients tested are homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify the eligible participants, who shall sign agreement with the participation in the test, including men, women, transsexuals and individuals with a partner whose HIV status has not yet been controlled by the appropriate treatment.
People living and registered at GP in the United Kingdom may also apply to their local sexual health clinic and refrain from potential participation in testing.
The program will bring taxpayers to £10 million and NHS England signed this week the contract to distribute medicines after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its target, use and implementation to a large extent.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should be complementary and exhausting constantly and more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than thirty years' effort to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health."
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: “We are witnesses of a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
If PreEP is given correctly and patients are at risk, it will offer the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic.
NSH will offer from September patients exposed to high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and immediate need to reinterpret a partner, leading to improved quality of life.
We welcome this statement.'
Ian Green, Executive Director Terrence Higgins Trust said: "The number one priority must be the rapid introduction of tests across the country; we must ensure that it is available to each patient.
We now have the trial drug PrEP and we are on a good path to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.'
The shadow ministry of health Sharon Hodgson said: "The beginning of the trial period PrEP is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of deferral and suspension by the government.
Evidence indicates how transformative this medicine can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and the elimination of the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The following tests will bring us closer to full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start tests as soon as possible throughout the country and protect those who are exposed to HIV and thus end the spread of HIV in society.'
Life on high feet: betweenpatro and smart design changed this small apartment at the Earls Court in a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for properties, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 for an apartment on Earls Cour.
It is located on the first floor of the smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is an impressive display of modern design that uses the maximum available space.
“I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
"I was looking for something more reasonable.
I hit this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same roof height.
I fell in love with him right away, and I was mad at him the same day."
Since then, the apartment has been in a size of 1,000 meters of complete renovations.
The one-room apartment with a complicated layout - for you to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add the storage space and interspatre to use a high ceiling.
“I applied for high ceiling, big windows and lots of lights.
That's what my demands were," she said.
For this purpose, Erfana Azadi from the design and design studio Duck & Shed was based in Notting Hill and used an almost four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not only a project but also a place to live.
The ostrich did not reach such heights as to make two gaps - a challenge for architects so it was to create an interspecies on which to go straight.
Erfan must have involved his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is completely complicated," he explained.
"We had to organize both rooms in such a way that we could go straight.
It wasn't just to build a simple platform, but at the same time to push the steel structure so that the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two suitable rooms on its own - and at the same time add to the drama.
In the space, you can find a beautiful living room with an old honeydew frame in the design of Retrovius.
The mirror furniture in gold color, silver line and retro mirror Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramatism, space and lighting.
A short walk is measured mirror on both sides and it looks so much longer.
The mirror sheets in the kitchen look like a window into another room.
There are storage spaces at the entrance doors designed to store appliances and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which stimulates the impression of significantly larger space throughout the apartment, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
Convenient kitchens are nothing new.
What's unique about this solution, however, is a locker door.
"We had to solve the technical site," Erfan says about the decorated doors.
"The door is designed to be uncompromising in order to avoid it very easily."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne has gained another 16 meters square, second room and a better overall distribution of the apartment.
"When it comes to this, what you sell is the residential area - or the appreciation of your property," Erfan said.
‘The real estate broker shall, in principle, calculate its price on the basis of the residential area.’
In this case, it was possible to increase the residential area while maintaining quality materials that promote the space of luxury views.
“Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional atmosphere with your home,” Erfan added.
“You don’t like the diluents of electricity in the walls.
Yes, they're important, but your hearts don't get it."
As it turned out, the quality design and the increase of the living space can change the usual apartment to exceptional work.
And just like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is joining.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and the red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on the travel of its citizens to Tennessee and other seven states.
The State of Tennessee has paid it and issued a legal ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, it is not a ban in full terms of meaning that citizens of the United States can travel freely throughout the fifty states.
This is that California has banned state money on its citizens' travels to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strong for LGBT and any manifestations of non-conformity with LGBT's lifestyle consider discrimination.
Tennessee, however, has adopted a law on the protection of the conscience, according to which a psychotherapist, who has a moral problem with the treatment of patients in the LGBT community, is not obliged to provide it, but is obliged to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and the other States have again adopted laws which require religious charity organisations, which have received children from their mothers after birth to adopt, do not have the obligation to provide these children with the same sexes.
Because of these laws on freedom of conscience, California has banned the financing of its citizens' travels to eight states of the Union from its own resources.
In practice, this means that California professors must not have routes to scientific symposia, for example, in Texas paid off from their universities because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions such as Tennessee with financial support from their schools.
On the way they must get either federal grants, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance citizens' travel from State A to State B, or private sponsoring.
The State of Tennessee has become patient and its parliament has adopted the law with a resolution that it does not like California's policy of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and the tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still does not affect the travel embargo in California.
He's throwing them as a kidnapping for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the Union which would otherwise have imposed a similar travel ban for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the fact, now comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, everything is constitutional, nothing is counter-constitutional.
States shall have the right to adopt laws on freedom of conscience, as well as to decide what their money is going to go to and what they are not allowed to do.
Second, what's wrong with the defense of conscience?
When a potter has a religious problem selling mushrooms, why not offer only beef, lamb, poultry, and fish?
Why is it that he is forced to sell under the penalty even to the pigs when there is enough for the hunters who offer the pigs?
In the state of Colorado, one baker faces an anti-discrimination complaint and a high penalty because he refuses to bake a cake at a homosexual wedding.
But he also refuses to buy Halloween cakes or alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him at his room and the appropriate cake unordered by hundreds of other bakers?
Third, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the Federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust domestic policies in powers that are not federal, according to their own preferences.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT communities have at times legitimately sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are governed by the rule of life and let them live, which should be guided by all reasonable people, but some activists never try to tolerate themselves and others, but extreme intolerance to others.
According to them, no one can ever show a moral, religious or philosophical conflict with LGBT's lifestyle, and if he does so, he should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is total.
They're new enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know the situation in American history when the states have done so for political issues, except in the case of one.
Even in the days of the civil rights struggle for blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of the segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
In this only case was the 50th century, the political cause was slavery, and it was destined for the North War against the South.
Of course, nothing like this happens now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the blue democratic and the red republican states is deepening and the United States is mentally interlinked.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's critique got a fat puke.
Russian opposition policy Alexej Navalnyj received 300 thousand rubles for violating the rules of the campaign before the presidential elections, which will take place next year.
The court sentenced him for inviting people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
In the last two months, Navalny has organised two major anti-government street protests and announced that he wants to be held in March next year.
Chief Kremlin Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to him in the morning and took him to court.
He was punished for inviting people to demonstration through videos posted on the YouTube Internet portal.
Pokuta's three hundred thousand.
"Later we cut them off from the judge's pay," he joked on the Twitter critic Kremla.
The Russian electoral commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential elections because he had previously been convicted of treason.
Navalny, who is considered a combatant against corruption, but the relevant judgment is considered politically motivated.
The fines amounting to 300 thousand rubles, the sentence of 25 thousand rubles was also filed on Thursday with two members of the Navalte pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalnyj entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on a fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend the Navalni in the campaign as much as possible.
In February, he was sentenced to five years of parole because he stole a forest company, Kirovles.
In May, the verdict was upheld by the court of appeal.
The judgment is so powerful that the Navalni is prevented from running under the Russian laws.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of their Italian family, move to one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth over $500 million.
Former director Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis is staying in Toorak, only three rooms from his younger brother Paula, who had a dispute about joint property and commercial property to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in 2014, but the sharp dispute was constantly washed out before the highest court.
Together with his mother Anna's own brothers are 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store bought a family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwood.
In this place, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the whole company in an estimate of $85 million.
Other properties and portfolio of the De Lutis family have been purchased for money, including offices, building grounds in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one third of the assets of the company, while his father Colin, who according to Paul’s words is “a significant force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns two thirds of the assets.
The court records indicate that Colin's own properties are $316 million, while Paul manages properties for $176 million.
For Paul, the problem was that property and financial resources were divided.
"Colin's proposal was expressed in my eyes in particular for his benefit," Paul wrote in a local court statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts on peace, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
Now brothers are also struggling to control the existing business - from which Paula spoke of Colin.
Colin resists the fact that it is not true and blames Paul for miscarriage with certain properties.
In Colin's previous cross-sectional statement, he stated that he believed in a capable solution to the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates to me that the family is one of the most important," he wrote.
The costs of the courtroom are rising. Hundreds of pages of local declarations, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, have been flooded by lawyers, including Allana Myerse, QC and both sides' advocates.
Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who had been operating milk bars and bottles since the 1950 ’ s and in the 1970 ’ s bought a farm in Brunswick.
They bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in the last year of high school, Paul was still a young, about 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis stated that together with Luigim, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of the property to the sons would go well.
"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end in court," she wrote.
Another two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the group of De Lutis family. Colin stated that at his departure Mark was compensated for 10 million dollars and Luke for 26 million dollars.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark “were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation. ”
Since then, Colin has been holding back, despite the fact that he is an former member of the AFL Club’s showcase, as stated in his 2015 autobiography, Eddie McGuire, known television personality and best friend Colina.
Fairfax Media contacted Colina and Paula de Lutisova and their lawyers on Friday.
He only answered Colin by means of a textual report stating that, given the fact that the dispute is settled before the court, "I have nothing to add".
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to settle the whole matter before the court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of the judgments, Colin stated that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s requirements.
"Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation," he let himself be heard and added that "he still hopes for a viable solution."
On Friday, all hopes were inconceivable.
"Our disputes will resolve in the early days of the trial," Colin wrote.
Weather in Czech Republic.
Teachers are showering kids.
MDD drivers are fashioning water and summer clothing.
At the mother's school in Chodovci, Prague, where about 35 children are now, they only go out in the morning.
The shell is after reconstruction and the dried trees do not yet provide a large shade.
There's no pool there, but the kids are showering at the mall.
In the afternoon, the children remain in classes where they are worn wounds and hanging curtains.
The air tries to cool clean air because they don't have air conditioning.
It's for teachers and cooks, too.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and abroad, exceeds the hygiene limits for maternal schools, so we should not even have an open operation during this period," said Miloslav Makovicová, school director.
In the school there's a damn corridor where the temperature moves about 40 degrees.
We'll blow up in the morning at 6 o'clock, close the windows and have on the south side the wounds we're protecting.
"But it won't help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest school at Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have grown trees on the ground, so we're under them.
"We've got a beautiful fixture there, there's a table underneath it, and there's different things we do," said the school director of Barbara Kompanová.
Teachers and children are trying to go to a forest where there's a bigger guy.
The kids have wet hats and different water games on the program.
"We have a hand pressure interrogator that is used for flower snacks, and we use it for showering children," Kompanová said.
The director of the elementary school in Novoborská Street at the Prague Prosek Jitka Vilimovská said that teachers of children are trying to keep them in the shade and the drops are water.
"We have a relatively grown garden, so they're under trees there," she said.
It goes out in the morning and then after 15 o'clock.
Every child must have a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a small cup of tea or a regular juice and have a drink of water in the garden.
Every day, they also have vegetable salads and fresh fruit and vegetables that parents sometimes bring.
"Maybe today one mother here brought about a decimal melon for children," Makovicová added.
Drivers get water or summer chalk.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with hot water, ion drinks or summer cots in hot days.
The driver’s cabs also trams buses are mostly air-conditioned, DPP spokesperson Aneta Röhková said.
In addition to the cabin, some trams are air-conditioned in the passenger space.
Tramwa's high-temperature colleges have not done any serious harm.
There was a minor damage in the alley in Hostivari.
At present high temperatures, we are primarily concerned with the availability of sufficient quantities of drinks for drivers.
"The cooled drinking water is available in all seams, skiding points and carriages," said Réhková.
In the carriages and in some parking lots, employees have available so-called sodas that produce a cold soda.
Drivers also get soluble ion protection drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts," the speaker added.
The hot and dry weather of the last days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, their fires throughout the Czech Republic were eliminated by 108, i.e. a double of the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, the day the temperatures in the Czech Republic splintered over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly engaged in firefighting.
"They consider fires in the natural environment and also those that are connected with feminist works," said a speaker to the firemen Nicole Zaoralová.
Even the night shift of the weather, when the heat in a number of places was cut off by storms and wave strikes, did not bring the fire to the fire.
In connection with the storms, firemen went out to 236 attacks.
It was particularly about the removal of fallen trees and plants.
"They were no longer occupied in the Middle East," Zaoralová continues.
But the help of the firemen was also needed in Svolínka in the Českolipsk, where the storms evacuated 60 people from the camp safely.
Tropical temperatures also assigned work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the toilets drove to dozens of cases of oxygen poisoning with fine coal.
That's why people should let their water heaters check, protect their lifeguards.
The carbon dioxide is a colourless gas without smell, which relaxes during incomplete burning.
The symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspicion of poisoning, leave the frozen room.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the president's media diet
Many have tried it before and have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, it'll be the first.
The Portal Politico stated that the new Chief of Staff in the White House plans to limit President Trump's information - including reports in television reports - to the hope that he will keep Trump on the ground.
Here is part of the report by reporter Josh Dawseye:
“When the new Chief of Staff of the White House John F. Kelly met with the new staff on the first day, he raised the key issue of Trump's White House, which he intends to correct: the incorrect information that the president receives in his hand.
Kelly informed the employees that he must personally approve all the information - whether in paper or word - because the president can decide on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors were in control of Trump and his presentation in the media broke their teeth.
Trump's relationship with the media is dating back several decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate was disturbed by honest reports, it was appropriate for him to show that he spoke about him in a positive light many other media that was easier to convince," said Politico Sam Nunberg, former campaign advisor in February.
Tara Palmeriová from the Politico portal then wrote that "the key to keeping Trump tweets in the lobby - at least according to the words of six former organizers - is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media that sings praise to him."
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump's tendency to publish his views on Twitter was once "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something they don't know about -- that Trump's tweets would be more annoying if someone didn't control them.
The tweets that Trump has never left, we'll never know.
If his employees managed to keep him at least several times in trust, then their efforts did not go unnoticed.
However, no one has ever been able to prevent Trump regularly to raise controversial topics.
Part of this problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by moving the Trumps to materials that they can, but do not have to be reliable, that support their view of the world.
The Policy Portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the intention of advisers to submit questionable information to the head of the state.
This is an example of such information from the reporter Shane Goldmacher's pen:
“The current and former officers of Trump claim that the President is often very angry with the negative news from the media, especially the news about the lack of information, and is trying to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone highlighted to the president a copy of the article from GotNews.com - the website of the provocator Charles C. Johnson - who accused the deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being a "source of many leaks of information" from the White House.
No matter what Johnson has always been on Twitter for the cause of the complaint; or that he has not submitted his claim with any evidence; or that he has already made false accusations in the past and has later withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and started asking Walsh."
Goldmaker added that then the chief of the Reince Priebus staff and the secretary of the White House of Rob Porter "were trying to implement the system for the management and documentation of information received by President Trump".
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to put forward the same strategy.
Maybe it turns out he's more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulses don't go away and his assistants are still fighting for power.
These unchangeable factors of Kelly's mission certainly bother you.
Tourists discuss burial and return to the “Millionary Quarter”
Several of the most mobile home owners in the West Midland County of England will again be allowed to go back to the destination of the selected tourists, who negotiate with local authorities on the right to reclaim the field for their seats.
Tourists parked 20 caravans on the ground near the thriving street in Solihull, which is called the “millionaire quarter”.
Bringing horses, children and the army of caravans, tourists return after they were shown in May. They did not even have a burial which was dug on site under the regulations of the authorities to prevent their entry.
The tactical group found gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with the caravan unprotected space that served as the road.
The strong residents of the city of Solihull attacked the administrative council by ‘not being able to solve the problem’.
One of the residents who wanted to remain anonymous said: “They planted this place on Monday night after they were moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones after other people.
The Governing Council should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they're back.
Last night the next one arrived, and today they'll probably get even more."
She added that : ‘The Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to impose this problem.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't want to keep building taxes until the board of directors has arranged with tourists."
Another of the anonymous residents said, "It's funny. We've just been watching the latest leaving tourists and now they're back.
And this time there's more of them and this time they brought horses with them."
The press spokesman, the Solihull Board of Directors, said: "We are aware of the unauthorized stay on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the whole problem.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is necessary that as many locals as possible declare any inconsistency or illegal conduct of the police at number 101.
We're going to get a whole picture that we're going to take to court.'
My husband hit a car in Brussels with a Europly.
He was brought by a government special.
The government special delivered wounded Robert Žitňanski to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.

Italians attach to the fight against the rescue ships of NGOs with immigrants on board
Italy announced that it would prohibit the arrival of rescue ships of NGOs that are joining the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean unless NGOs sign new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue in their operations," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities had entertained the ship of the German rescue organisation Jugend Retett for suspicion of trafficking with people, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which operates for the first year, refused to comment on the whole matter on the grounds of the accusation by the Italian state prosecutor Ambrogia Cartoje.
“They are for us and will always be the priority number one rescue of human lives. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in rescue zones at the present time,” the organisation stated in a social statement.
"All current charges can only be commented upon after collecting all the information and assessing the whole situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the juvenile organization Jugend Retettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on board, who have been transferred directly to human beings, and repeatedly.
At least one meeting was reportedly only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the complainant's report. The meeting was published by the Italian media.
The crew of the ship is suspected of violating the law and involving the Italian Coast Guard, who oversees rescue operations in this area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, more than anything else.
Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board a ship, such as Youth to monitor activities.
Only three out of nine non-governmental non-profit organizations that are involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last designated organisation stated on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable, since they do not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" with regard to rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of a new code of conduct has been rejected by doctors without borders (MSF), who is the holder of the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, Minniti has heard that a sharp decline in immigrants in recent weeks, who are leaving Italy in the context of rescue operations, indicates that efforts to strengthen surveillance on the coast of Libya and cooperation with local elders bear fruit.
"In the last days we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He also identified plans for further negotiations to take place this month with the old Libyans on economic development initiatives, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali, on measures to reduce the number of migrants left by these countries in the hope of achieving Europe.
Unhappily Mesaroš: She had a silicone and a cellulite lying on her lap!
The hot summer days are all about taking on the most necessary part to cover the most intimate parts.
Just Dominika Mesaroš is doing it the other way.
At an afternoon meeting in the Prague Zoo, where the actors, the moderators, the singers and all they have to do with TV Prima, just the faucet, put their body in the mini-overal.
And only a few regular movements and a model showed everyone their silicas, but also a bunny.
He took care of her for how many times he had to get in between half, and he was so high he had to fix it all the time.
The attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present certainly had no need.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages for suicide to Conrad Roye
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for encouraging her friend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Two-year-old Michelle Carter is staying 15 months from a two-year sentence behind bars and then spends five years on parole.
Carter was sentenced in June to the unintentional murder of Conrad Roye, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Roy’s father said in court on Thursday: “The whole family is crushed.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision was taken.
Up to 20 years of freedom threatened her, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy had suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and cream blouses, Carter was standing when declaring the judgment on the spot with tears in his eyes, his hands and his eyes pointing to the ground.
"Her performance killed Conrad Roy," the judge said.
"She ended his life to get you out of here.
She couldn't accept her own responsibility," she said.
"There were no results."
However, the legal representative of Carter said that these were “unfortunate circumstances which he was uneasy to regret. ”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “their age or level of maturity or even mental disorders do not have a significant impact on her performance”.
The complainant read Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy,’s statement: “Don’t run away one day so that I don’t regret my son’s loss.
I want him to be proud of me - I'm taking care of his sister and we're going to suffer the pain that we're going to bear with us forever," said the statement.
Roy's sister Camdin Roy testified that she "separates" her conscience that she never took part in a brother's wedding and will never be a aunt of his children.
"The loss of the person I've been seeing since I was born is the pain I will bring to my life," she said.
The State of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would force a person to commit suicide to another person. This case is therefore a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 on the car seat, poisoned by carbon dioxide.
The case came to the attention of the whole nation after Carter's textual reports were published that led to suicide.
"I don't care if you both jump out of the building or get out of the building," wrote the text reports that Carter only sent two weeks before his death when Roy was on his family leave.
A few minutes before his suicide, he wrote, "You have to do it Conrade" and "You're just gonna hit the generator and you're gonna be free and happy."
Judge Moniz stated that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to hold any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who stood by Carter's side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, the charge was dismissed.
Ms Knox (30) made a statement at the Los Angeles Times: "Michel Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison."
Audi adjusts up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to acute response
The day before the announcement, the Audi car manufacturer BMW indicated that it would offer its customers an update of the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The president of BMW said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is based on BMW - which consider the ban or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he would adjust the three million Mercedes vehicles across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a download.
European car manufacturers have promoted a large proportion of the use of diesel atolls in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon dioxide regulation.
However, nitrogen oxide, which releases diesel engines, is considered to be carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of cars on the installation of a gas neutralisation facility issued by diesel engines, which facilitates the competitiveness of cars.
While German car manufacturers are facing close visits, the office of Angela Merkel is facing charges of disassembling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s errors, which in order to meet the emission limits installed in their vehicles, which reduced the amount of emissions released during the test, but under normal conditions the software was disabled.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen were accused in the United States and others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the engine development department in Audi would be arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian national and does not apply to him, so he may face a trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in the criminal investigation of the German police in the Volkswagen car after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system that had to cover European emission limits - and extended the charge that Audi faces in the United States.
The inclusion of the Audi car in the investigation may have a bad impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer forms a disproportionate share of the Volkswagen profit.
The plane stopped by emergency at the beach.
The man and the girl are dead.
An accident occurred on the beach Praia de São João in the area of Costa da Caparica, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the TV channel SIC News said that the plane was flying straight ahead of the people who were on the beach.
Some people from the beach were supposed to flee from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people couldn't escape the machine.
On the beach according to local media, a 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died.
"The plane hit them and they were dead," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias described.
Their nationality is not known yet.
There were two people aboard the plane, both of them getting out of the accident alive, and the police took them to the polls.
D11 or not to set the road.
And the roads in the Czech Republic are complete?
I'll give you a fight.
It's unattainable, even though it started to build in 1978.
Even though it's unattainable, it's constantly being repaired.
And it must not continue to be built, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, the D11 fence.
The construction of its next section for at least a few months has stopped the movement of the Earth’s children.
We walkers get a road around the corner, as if they're stealing the salsa.
They're hiding their doll and then they'll just see when and if we can get another one.
Then we don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the time of the trip and we want to get a truck driving to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Infinite trucks flow directly through the city of Jaroměř or Nachod, which is not as reasonable as the object.
But so far the last piece of our dream road was carried out in 2008, that is, nine years ago.
Not a dick since then.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of unfinished section to Hradci Králov and other sections to Jaroméří began with an archaeological research that started at the end of this year, you could hear the loud applause of the punctures in the eastern Czech Republic.
No one believed it.
Last week it turned out that it wasn't going to be built this year.
And maybe not next year.
The movement of the Children of the Earth-Club for sustainable transport from Brno has given a breakdown.
Children Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
They attacked a decision on building permits all over the place.
They shall request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the relevant authorities.
For example, the mayor of the city, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Office.
So far, we're riding from D11 to a nearby village with an excellent name for the funeral.
So we ride, we just go down the street and suddenly stand on the sidewalk, and we prefer to join the column next.
The worst part is that you see similar stories throughout the Republic.
It's a scary, constant road to Beneshov, D1 or D8.
Everyone has their own funeral.
What are the Children of the Earth requiring?
What is the essence of the problems of the construction of communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is the road network practically infinitive in the current system?
Read in the new reflex.
Levandule from Provence threatens climate change
Levandule has become a symbol of the Provence in the south-east of France, but they are now threatened with climate change.
Levanduli lives as a result of dry climate and harmful moisture, causing fear on the faces of researchers and farmers seeking solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the Provence Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM, stated: “The cultivation of lavender in Provence is threatened because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate changes that bring less precipitation in the spring and in the autumn.
It affects the life of the lavender.
They also have their own cicadas and cows carrying micro-bacterials in the dry climate."
There's a lot in the bet.
Levandule attracts tourists and oil that is produced from them is an important ingredient of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The place of long and beautiful flowers is growing smaller, unsolicited and often weak plants.
The quantity of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, smaller."
A possible solution can be a more efficient distribution of water and a slowing down of water from the ground, but also a lavender spray protects the mixture of soil and water and several species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of journalists highlights growing threats in Mexico
Employees of the riodoce weekly meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the problems that are being experienced in the area of Sinaloa with the participation of organised criminals, corrupt officials and drug-free wars.
Today, however, under recent events, he meets mainly for his own safety.
They know it's important to change their habits.
Two deserving journalists are talking about what would be safer: taking their children with them to the office where someone attacked the grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the black table: opponents, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to every word - there is no need for any evidence, just to use imagination and imagination.
Choosing them out of what - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspicious of taking money from government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to hide criminal proceedings.
Violence does not exist, and the bodies are fighting against the whole country; journalists remain among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, they are at least 25 from President Enrique Pena Neta's accession to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven of them were killed this year in all seven states.
Among them is the co-founder of the journal Riodace, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence that is being eaten by drug trafficking.
His loss is sensational, although his presence is all-passing - a large photo of Valdez with the title "Justice", on which he shows the medium hanging across the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years of age, have a shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on the face, glasses on the nose and the hat of Panama.
A meeting takes place not two months after his death; journalists talk about each other's traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, two suspects have so far complained to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime.
Journalists from Riodoce insist that they will inform about the violence that is taking place in Sinaloe; even though they are the destruction of the land and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the murderers and without a sense of justice, the meeting on security is unexplained, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, we can't trust anyone."
On 15 May, Valdez left the center of Riodoce in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to capture several blocks when his red Toyota Corroll was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, according to the name of the article - which can be translated as the Twelve River.
The shooters then got into his car and ran her off the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left his wife and two grown children behind.
It seems that the news is spreading rapidly in Culiacan.
In Valdez's case, however, there's a suspect in silence.
Since yesterday's arrest of Guzman and his January edition into the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's most bloody battles, how the rival fraction tries to fill an empty place.
Every day, several people and graves are killed in the streets of Sinaloa, full of two-footed mausoleum for drug kings, many of whom are bigger than homes.
Forget the moment that the word "appropriate" means that one drug cartel controls the coastal state with precious ports and important routes that travel to the United States of America.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was familiar with the risks of his employment, with Ismail Bojorquez (60), the co-founder and director of Riodace still deplores the fact that he did not protect his friend.
They believe two doubts have contributed to his death.
The first was February's interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that led the war with Joaquín Guzman's sons.
The peace could have angered the sons; suspicious gang members gathered all copies of the news at the time they arrived on the counter.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the entertainment of the other news in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death was seen as an important milestone in the fight against Mexican criminals against journalists.
He was able to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed it would never change.
In the magazine Noroest he was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his stock at $50 and set up with five colleagues in Riodoce.
In Sinaloe, "it was impossible to operate newspapers and not mention drug trafficking," Bojorquez said.
In time, Riodoce gained a good reputation for the firm and truthful reporting; the newspapers began to do so.
Newspapers were happy to go to search for issues and publish texts without censorship - readers were fascinated by reading stories that nobody else dared to publish.
Eight years after the foundation, Riodoc won Maria Moors Cabot's prestigious award for a Latin American report.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Review of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his firm report on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted to fear.
"I was afraid of my life," he said when he accepted the prize.
The trade in drugs in Sinaloa is "the way of life," Valdez said in October last year in a conversation for Rompeiento TV.
“You have to take on the role of journalists – or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What did you do to the face of death... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The staff of Riodoce met after Valdez. The man was familiar with his jokes and non-chosen language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar in front of the office and sat at the same table.
Now they're asking: did this routine blame his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job the best and stay alive?
"They don't like when you're messing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret landing grounds."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
This results in a high level of self-assessment and self-esteem.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel like there's nothing going on here, hand off.
The problem is, editor Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "what's the point that can be fucked up... and then it came to that thing with Javier."
According to him, the old rules, like others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, which are home to a toxic mix of luxurious pastures, weak governments and corrupt policies.
The country is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where employees of Riodoce meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered that bought governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Before the building, two policemen find the left in front of the 40-degree water in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the office of Riodoce, which is located in the four-storey building in Culiacan city district.
Newspapers are afraid that these police officers are not the only 50 percent of the law's defenders who are, according to the government's statement, corrupting.
It's been a few months since the press last released to the mountain areas that basically control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the program this week.
The first of these is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chavez in Sinaloe.
They also have dedicated themselves to suspicious government expenditures carried out in the home city of the Governor of the State.
Recently, there have also been several kidnappings in one of the most luxurious Culiacan restaurants, a single block from the state representative's office.
No one officially announced the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so the reporters were aware when they were going to write about what each city's inhabitants know: that the restaurant is the favorite destination of drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from the public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a certain policy, which is a member of the institutional revolutionary party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene almost throughout the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption in high places.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about the previous incidents that occurred at the restaurant, including the incident where one of the sons of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzman escaped the military unit.
A month ago, readers would read about this topic in the Valdez section, which was the best source of information on kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly solve the case," said Villareal (46), who is renamed "El Flaco" for his nuanced character.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office has changed into a cedula warehouse and a label for protests against the killing of journalists. Employees certainly did not expect them to become activists in the press representation.
The journalist, Miriam Ramirez, came down with a number of signs and issued the following morning to demonstrate himself before the state representative's office because of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared only three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
It was revealed only by the burned body, the authorities claim that the DNA analysis is Adamea.
The activity of journalists is taking place throughout the country. Many of them organize protests and gather on the streets and buildings of “SOS print”.
The director of the Bojorquez news is the day of a visit to Washington, where he seeks international support and achieves justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, who was taking place the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez has accused the authorities of monitoring journalists and their murder for declaring the truth.
In the meantime, she asked for a transfer to another department to fear that her anger might threaten her neutrality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "defeated" by organised crime, corrupt officials and the poor public.
In his last book Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists die not only by the hand of drug cartels, but also by the order of policies and security forces that cooperate with organised crime.
The Media Supervisory Group Article 19 accused more than half of all attacks on police journalists and public officials.
"In Mexico you will die because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
The murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who occurred six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with a message that allegedly signed the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up with my messages."
Next to her head, she lay a keyboard and a listener.
Some branches decided to end the activity, such as the El Norte newspaper, which is located at the northern borders of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of the rapporteur Miroslavy Breach.
The others continue, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the death of its director in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez presented public drug cartels with an article on the front page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some reporters fled their homes or even across the border.
It's an awkward decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as it is to get rid of the feeling that someone is constantly following you.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Rubena Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in the apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who have decided to stay and not give up their jobs, there is a great risk every day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, that's why I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday afternoon, and the staff of Riodoce is sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when suddenly he starts calling the phone.
It is learned that 19 people died at a gunfire between gang members and police officers near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is taking place, just as many of the messages left in this area have been promised.
Newspapers publish this news from the mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
He won't even run one day and the opening title is changing again.
The sounds of the police sirens show up on another gunshot.
Bojorquez takes a summer look at police surveillance to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't give up.
Under the huge portrait of the co-founder who fell their journal - whose mediator is an outstanding slogan for the whole Sinaloe - all employees of Riodoce follow his steps.
"How can we just think about leaving," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, an internist asked me to send her to the street?"
The dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a socha, no matter how scary.
Researchers have now discovered the findings of the first findings of a remarkable creation of the size of a nosor, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called “Mona Lisa dinosaurs” - have found a Canadian mine.
The remains were kept to such a high degree that the experts were able to determine the red hue of his dirty skin and stated that the dinosaur had a “problem past”.
The article in the magazine Current Biology stated that it is “the most remarkable ever found defense dinosaur and one of the best species of dinosaurs in the world”.
The rock is the new species of nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the period Krīda, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked researchers who described it as “in fact remarkable”.
According to National Geographic, the protected whitesmith is still the best preserved rock of his species.
The discovery is based on Shawn Funk, who discovered the stone on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium descent near the Canadian Alberty.
He came across something that looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it closer.
The stone was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working on the discovery of animals from a huge piece of land weighing 1,100 kg.
After completion of work, the dinosaur is ready to reveal.
"It's enough to rub your eyes and believe you're asleep," said Caleb Brown's work leader and the naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
"It will certainly be recorded in history as one of the most beautiful and cherished species of dinosaurs - Mona Lisa dinosaurs."
In his study of skin, researchers found that this exuberant - although he was covered with brilliance and recalled walking tank - he was most likely facing a serious threat from massive dinosaurs.
The heavy-duty dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a masking system that uses many animals today.
Experts claim that it made it possible for him to better blend in with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The masking system indicates that he was the favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
News of 110 million years of the old Nodosauridae dinosaur appeared first in the May newspaper. At the present time, it is available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers gave him the name Boraleopelt markmitcheli after Mark Mitchell's museum technique, which with the team spent more than 7,000 hours in the safe discovery of fossils.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of fossilism, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could document the patterns and shape of caves and debris all over the body.
They discovered a method of masking that is usually used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, finding researchers is surprising because Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
It is possible, then, that dinosaurs were such a multitude of predators that evolution gave the advantage of masking before confrontation.
Many modern animals with masking - such as deer, zebra, or peacock - are much smaller and also more vulnerable to the use, indicating that nosodaurus had to fight for his survival literally.
"The transmission of a huge and heavy armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by predators during the period of the wing," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in the mushrooms also revealed that dinosaur skin was likely to have a red-ish coloration.
Researchers continue to study animals and watch for further knowledge of their life, including preserved stomach contents, to eat their last meal.
They believe that after death the dinosaur fell into the river and was taken to the sea where he drowned at the bottom.
In the area of Alberta at the time, there was the same climate as today's Florida and rivers and oceans have moved much further into the interior than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is really remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved dirty skin and at the same time it is kept in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,” Brown said.
“For these reasons, animals look practically the same as in the time of the wings.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; just a little blurry your eyes and it looks like he's just asleep.'
During the time of the crests the earth was accompanied by huge thermopods, masseuse dinosaurs, who moved on two feet.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyronasaurus rég - lived several million years after Borealopelt, this armored dinosaur could be the favorite of its equally terrible ancestors.
Among them is Acrocanthosaurus, 11.5 meters long monster with a weight of over 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in the magazine Current Biology, believe that Borealopelt’s body was sunk into the sea after it was mummified in the bath.
Next, Shawn Funk, who discovered the stone on 21 March 2011 when Suncor Millenium was returned to the bottom of Canada's Alberty.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved protected dinosaur in the world, including leather and tanning, which is also complete from garlic to garlic.
The animal reached an average length of 5 metres and weighed up to 1300 kg.
He had two 50 cm of bones out of his shoulder.
Researchers believe that this former brewer has crossed the land of Canada today, until he has ended up in the river that has swept him to the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil residues of this species are also maintained to the extent that the protected wages around the skull are still covering the residues of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote back to National Geographic, “finding such a hidden entity can be compared to winning in the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking the finding seems to me.
Fossil residues of this species are also maintained to the extent that the protected wages around the skull are still covering the residues of the skin.
On his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing upward.
I can't help counting the holes on his feet.'
How did one activist find out the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shot all over the body.
On the day she arrived in New York, St. Louis's mother sat on a bed in the Airbnb room and made contributions to Facebook on her phone.
She then ran into a high school student's contribution.
"The police just shot an 18-year-old, whose body is still lying on the street," he said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @TheePharoh constantly retweeted her contributions to the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis posted on Twitter his contributions to the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot by a white-haired police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of Brown's body, which is lying on the street without government, from where no one even took it for four hours.
"That's crazy," she thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She postponed the phone to return to him the night she watched tweets about the people who gathered at Canfield Drive.
She was following a photograph of police tapes and shouting people. One of the men claimed that he was the victim's father and hand held a note with the title "Fergusonian Police killed my unarmed son"!
She was following live news - one of the police stood before a group of protestors, holding a guide in his hand and at his second end of the beating dog.
In another video, another police officer said in his hand the gun he was pointing at and shouted, "I will kill you all... animals."
"It's not normal," said Ferrell.
“This is not the kind of murder that we have been accustomed to and which we can call normal.
I felt a bunch of skin all over the body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She went home the other day.
After arriving at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes the new document "Whose Streets?", which will appear in the film on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, forces and impatience expressed from the perspective of the people living in the community who go out into the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, the Ferrell dialogue with his daughter - dressed in flower dress and the same flower front - was launched on the theme that had already been discussed many times - "about black experience".
"Do you remember how I taught you how blacks had to fight for what they believed?" he recalls the conversation.
"Now we're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old and that's not right."
"It didn't seem like I would take her with me," Ferrell later stated.
"Today's events are the perfection... that happened in the past.
She had to know and see it in her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she had to know the difference between different levels of black experience and what we had to do to get rid of ourselves.
Although I am able to assure her of the conditions in which she will not live on her own skin of racism, she does not differ in any way from another black child-wife.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would only harm her."
After arriving in Ferguson, South Floriand Road was the first stop on the road to the police department, which became the main activists, who expected police officer Darren Wilson to take part in the incident.
This is where Ferrell met his daughter with the local businessman who was preparing for the other food.
Together they prepared food in bags and helped to spread it to Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrell, a new type of activism began to be born slowly.
"My activism turned up after 9 August," said Ferrell, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis High School, she was the president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. Association and sought to introduce health care and food in the Black communities.
"I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
About a few weeks later, Ferrell met a later co-director of the document, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farnar wanted to "document" the current events.
Ferrello, however, thought, "Are you working on a document or are you trying to find a story that could be used?"
Such a type of skepticism has penetrated into the community through many people, often white people, who want to earn for pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in the open talk: “We have heard that the voices of people who are born and growing up in Ferguson are very often forgotten and we wanted to change that.”
Folayan has already joined with co-director Damon Davis, a renowned local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners for the purpose of death.
His participation in the project also attracted Ferrell and the other six locals who were following the "Whose Streets" team in the years following Brown's murder.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but that's our statement," said Davis.
"That was important to me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on the experiences of Ferrell - in an effort to show that the movement "not about the rescue leader but about the community's approach," Folayan said - it was just the most inexplicable way to participate in the filming.
The document "Whose Streets?" describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell with a smile on her face, thinking at the first moment when she looked at the final version of the document.
"But I understand that, in order to do this work and the policing of blacks, I have to open up."
The story of Ferrell also highlights the role of the middle black woman in the wider aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of movement - who created in response to the murder of the teen Trayvona Martin in 2012 on social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves surprises.
"Black middle women at the leading positions are ultimately behind the movement," said Ferrell, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black Central women must bear the burden of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of middle black women."
However, it is true that "this is not just an affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of his opinions.
"That's exactly what she was pushing with power and energy," she said.
“that it is not an accident in front lines, because life on these crosshairs in the skin of black wonder women is dangerous.
You feel that energy attack in front of the screen."
In the meantime, back in Ferguson, cameras of television stations cleared their position, but the difficult race gap between the community and the police persists.
Ferrell has two and a half years of blocking the road during demonstrations.
The social political atmosphere in the area called home described as "unlawful."
Still, it is not in its efforts that it has been committed to since three years ago to the streets of Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains."
There was a field burning in Kolinsk.
There were dozens of firemen out there, helping the helicopter.
Not far from the Czech Boat in Kolínsk, between the towns of Bylana and Liblice, it was burned from 14:00 a.m. with a range of approximately 15 hectares.
The fire around 15:15 stopped spreading, the firemen declared the third stage of firefighting out of four possible.
According to the speakers, Ladislav Holomčík helped fire from the air to fire the helicopter.
At 18:00 the fires were extinguished, the fire caused damage to 700000 crowns.
There were dozens of professional and voluntary firemen fighting on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical failure in the engine compartment of the van.
Hasit also helped a helicopter who carried out six wells of water.
"In place of intervention, we handed him over to the owner until tomorrow at 8:00 a.m., a unit of volunteers of firemen," Holomčík said today.
And Coming Resemblance: artists create portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms in New York's Fridman Gallery is located immediately several faces of different shades of skin - white, black and breakfast - hanging from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them looks like the previous one.
All 30 portraits were made by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the lipsticks and hairs that Chelsea Manning sent to her.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison for unauthorized publication of secret cables to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on 2 August, bears the name A Coming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines his experience with technology, computer and art, and Manning, a transsexual and progressive dissident, whose punishment reduced Obama three days before leaving the U.S. president's office.
The algorithmic DNA analysis Manning and the use of 30 portraits to illustrate how a person with this genotype would look, created Dewey-Hagborg's Brit, unless an intellectual comment on DNA's subtlety - as well as many ways that DNA can be interpreted - and the unimaginable determinism of these interpretations, as well as identities.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking about being considered a woman since her youth. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of twenty complaints, including violations of six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were held by the prison staff. Only one black-and-white photograph of the lower quality on which Manning, apparently concerned, sits on the seat of the driver in the platinum blonde paruque, which is now connected.
In 2015, they still received a positive response to the 2012 Stranger Visions Dewey-Hagborg project.
In the framework of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as non-smoking cigarettes and chewers - to create a picture of possible images of these people.
And right now she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of opening a new exhibition.
However, visits and photography were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea with a question if she was interested in the DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse were blackmailed over two years by correspondence.
They even created comics called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented a vision of what would have happened if Chelsea had been loved and could have participated in the exhibitions in person.
President Obama really asked for the release of Manning for a few days after the comics, which was a welcome change after several years in the military prison in Kansas.
It is interesting, indeed, that the exhibition is taking place right at the time when Donald Trump is leading a war with people who are trying to publish government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to encourage their tweets in areas that should be supported.
In response to the question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that “all is happening for some reason”.
According to an artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls his huge signature (the letter "i" in the name is derived from the heart) after the end of "a single group based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
On the other hand, there are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - hundreds of letters C, G and A recorded with pendulums.
By listing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least on the biological page, we all are.
"I hope that people will take away from it that our genome does not depend on who we are, and that genetic data are subjective and everyone can explain them according to their own," Dewey-Hagborg said.
"DNA will tell many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last example of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above graphic novelty.
Shows Manning, which is drawn in King Kong's way from the United States Discipline Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as you stop in the speech, they win," it says.
"Never be silent."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," said the Philadelphian artist.
"When I think about it, it's the skin of a goose."
Manning's exhibition has not personally visited - which was predicted in the comic book - but when it does, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room with its masks, its own genomic characteristics, sorted as a bunch of Protestants.
This was also for the purpose of the exhibition, including nearly 160 cm high soybeans of Maning, on which the wheat are recorded by its genetic happy group.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel a little bit like a dove," Dewey-Hagborg said about the portraits.
"I wanted to convey the notion of mass movement, which takes the form of Chelsea and frees her."
Professor of the Northwest University and employee of the Oxford University for murder
In these days, international surveys are being conducted after professors of the Northwest University and the employees of the Oxford University, who are reaching out for suspicion of the murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, the police said.
On Monday, a arrester was issued for the murder of the first-degree man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. Jamese Cornell-Duranleau, reports the Cook County court case.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several point injuries.
The Chicago police reported that the body of the deceased was found on July 27th.
The police were informed by telephone. After arriving at Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead and detectives were investigating the case as a murder.
Lathem worked as a professor of microbiology and immunology at the North-West University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of the University for Public Relations, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was forbidden to enter the university's school premises.
"The whole issue is now being investigated by the competent authorities and the North-West University is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
Speaking universities and Somerville College stated in a statement sent by e-mail: "We were contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist also the American police."
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were really shocked and wanted him to join the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, a leading contact with the Chicago Police Department's public, stated that he calls on suspects to surrender to the competent authorities.
"Police has information on the location of their stay and the effort to locate the suspects is progressing," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and international police are helping in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were to occur in apartment no. 1008.
The police have described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it's not clear if the incident occurred on July 27th.
He added that Latham and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement for all residents: “Police is now working to draw up a time-list and profile of victims and investigates various motives, including domestic violence.”
"In the near future we will complete the WADA plan" - Vice-President of the Russian Government Mutko
The Vice-President of the Russian Government Vitaly Mutko stated that it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSAD).
‘At present, part of the criteria for the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this fact, the WADA plan was updated," Mutko introduced on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan, which addresses the criteria for restoring the validity of the RUSADA, which has recently been published on the organisation's website.
According to the Mutka Code, it doesn't contain anything that should bother Russia.
"Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA as soon as possible," he added.
However, one of the above criteria calls for the alleged sponsorship of Russian athletes by the government after a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which Richard McLaren investigated.
Mutko said on the subject: “We know the investigation, since our antidoping system has clearly failed.
It was adapted to all measures.
In our country, however, there were no state programmes and we cannot admit to anything that never existed."
Mutkov's words confirmed Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In his interview with Russian RSport Smirnov, he acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping factors, but added: “On many occasions we stated that the report contained controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the message entirely without exception," Smirnov said.
WADA suspected RUSSAD of carrying out doping checks within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation authorised the planning and merger of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
Following the visit of the Moscow Centre of the Organization in July, Director General WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "in the right way" to renew its validity.
The police have accused three people, one of whom is young.
The police accused three men of setting up a medium fire of a rare wooden church in Trinc-Gutech on Frýdecko-Místecka.
One accused is young, all three are Czech nationals.
They are threatened by a criminal act of general threat up to 15 years in prison.
To the press today, Moravian Police Director Tomáš Kužel told the press.
According to him, it was an intentional crime.
"It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," Kužel said.
He stated that the police would act on the possible arrest of the accused.
Further information according to the Director cannot be published.
"I can't tell yet, because, in fact, employees of the criminal police and investigation and state representative who is monitoring the case," Kužel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech dates back to the 16th century.
He was a valuable memory with many original equipment and images from the first half of the 16th century.
Major damage will go according to preliminary estimates to tens of millions of crowns, but historical loss is incalculable.
After the fires began to be considered a refurbishment of the church.
Most of the costs should cover the insurance, other costs are ready to be shared by the Ministry of Culture and the City, a public collection is also being prepared, and it is calculated with the contribution of the owner of the memory, i.e. local ferries.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine of the 16th century in Ostrava-Harbová also destroyed a fire fifteen years ago.
It was then the problem of electrical installation.
Then there was an exact copy in his place.
The state counts with the citizens in the defense of the state.
They'll support their training.
With financial support for defence companies, with voluntary fire training or with the training team, the purpose of the law on the preparation of citizens for the defence of the state is to be taken into account.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been entrusted with the task of the government, promises that it will thus be able to increase the physical capacity of the Czechs and their capabilities, which could then be used in crisis situations.
It comes from a proposal that the Ministry has prepared.
If the law were to be passed in the future, it would impose on support for the defense of the regular hundreds of millions of crowns.
The main objective of the proposal is to create an effective system, according to its authors, which would help to increase the readiness of the Czech Republic to defend the state, beyond the performance of the defence obligation and on the basis of voluntaryity.
For example, the State would financially or materially support radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would enable them to increase their membership capacity.
In return, he would obtain information about people who are willing to come to the country at the time of the crisis and about their abilities or material equipment.
Accreditation instructors could also be available to assist companies and other stakeholders in training or training.
It also includes organizing words with war veterans or people who have acted heroically.
One of the possible options is that a new authority should be set up to take care of the administrative and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that participation should be voluntary and that it should take advantage of their ability until the state of threat is declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual alignment of previously apparent boundaries between individual types of threats," the aim is to point to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.
The ministerial officials noted that this is why there is a need to focus on supporting the widest range of capabilities, not just those of the military.
"The main objective is to create a very broad framework that enables every citizen to respond adequately to the situation of the state or life, health and property of persons, to protect himself, to contribute, where appropriate, to the protection of others, and not to impede the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic by wrong conduct," the aim is stated.
The adoption of the law would bring small financial claims.
According to the Ministry, they will be subject to the selected variant.
For example, the Authority provides financial support for projects for the preparation of citizens for the protection of the state up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could be around 60 million crowns a year.
Other money would go to pay or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the role of the National Military Commands would have to be extended, which together employ another 42 soldiers.
The representatives of the Ministry have already stated that the law should also help to resolve the disagreement of certain Czech policies with the introduction of the European Union directive on the holding of arms.
It would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to leave some of the weapons that the directive commands.
Startups that will help your companies to miss another Uber
Amy Errettová wanted to measure the level of satisfaction of employees of her e-commerce startup, but did not find the appropriate research.
The answers were often inaccurate, inconvenient, or even misleading.
And although she promised anonymous research, some employees expressed their mistrust throughout the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of the e-commerce company hair care Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, who employs 75 people.
So she asked for outside help.
New start-ups from the human resources sector are constantly on the market that help the company with employee satisfaction research.
The creation and licensing of software for the purpose of measuring the duties of employees enable start-ups to carry out a quick vote, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offers a purely anonymous staff and a hot line for complaints, and in some cases also allows informants to be visited and contacted directly by the Director.
"There are tools like Strava and Fitbit on the market that follow your health status, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glint, based in Reedwood City.
Errett pointed out that Glinta’s ability to know more about what her employees think and how they feel in three years’ time.
In addition to quick research and the voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company temperature map and a regular overview of groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as a review of low-value managers - which allows users to work on repairs.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the working environment - in the event that they become another Uber - who turns out in the scandals after the former employee published on his blog a contribution describing the business environment and the burden on employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for research in corporate culture is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance sector can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Converter from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before Ubera scandals.
Between nearly 600 customers of Convercent are Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, under his wings, Uber also accepted.
Like Glint, Converter allows companies to send custom "blask" surveys, collect reliable information in real time and display heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints shall be sent directly to the Board of Directors.
"The court of public opinion has powerful regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of the Converter.
If the company is convinced of the wrong conduct of its employees or of non-ethical conduct - and if the regulators do not proceed - it can face the costly consequences resulting from the boycott of customers, the exhaustion of employees or judicial proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs more than 25,000 people than 500 locations, uses Converter more than a year to raise employees' awareness of corporate principles and procedures and to ensure an easy way to contact corporate governance.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to look for a telephone number or e-mail to run the company, formally complain and hope in a viable solution.
Often it was a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Deputy General Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no reliable way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses the Converter, rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never occurred before to managers sitting in the offices have been ensured for miles away from the actual settlement of complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"This is close to a holistic, overall view of employee experience," said Vitrano, who runs a group of Ruby Tuesday looking at risk management.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from judicial disputes by employees."
The companies ceased to take the ethics, values and participation of employees on a lightweight basis in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron’s fall in the abuse of the ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But only when "the social media has been devoted to the whole thing", companies began to realize that they cannot simply hide their bones in a box in the online world.
"Before people started using technology ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Converter offer their software in the form of a service for which companies are paying regular fees.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by the courageous capital investors who supported both startups.
The converter selected for his February campaign from the company such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital a total of $10 million and finally took over the capital of $47 million.
Glint won $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and during the entire campaign he won $60 million.
These investments are seriously surprising in view of the mutual character of companies, cultures and venture capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, they are not the main advantage of high wages and interesting projects.
Employees want to assume that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a company that strives for a positive message.
"If people are happy in their work, they assume that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Benefits LinkedIn, who uses Converter i Glint.
Investors earn if companies and companies prosper if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical instrument that ensures the commitment and commitment of employees to the company appears on the market, it is not surprising that there are many investors who support this effort.
According to labour culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is inconceivable if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that as soon as the company requests a recall from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change doesn't happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and lack of interest for employees.
"As soon as you ask for 4,000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, the director of the council at Kotter International, who was witnesses to many companies that relied too much on the same data.
“Because as soon as you don’t finish things, the employees start asking themselves, ‘Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I be interested?"
Madison Reed, who now regularly conducts a survey among employees each month, has been able to solve the problem by one day thanks to Glint, Erretová.
Following the collection of feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett managed to reorganise several teams within the company and to start communication training to solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday has a very important look at its employees and hopes that it will achieve a high level of employment in the field, which is known as frequent release.
"If you do not try to create a transparent working environment, employees will not believe you," Vitrano added.
“And as soon as you start losing your employees, you will lose customers.
And with the withdrawal of the customers, the whole company's broken down."
Thursday became the warmest day.
Thursday is with 38.3 degrees recorded in The Watchtower in Hodoninsk the warmest day of the year in Czech Republic.
He went through a Tuesday that was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute were informed of this.
On Thursday, however, there were not many temperature records.
Weather hit Moravu mainly, it was mostly cloudy in the Czech Republic.
On Tuesday, they were overcome or recorded at 35 of the 145 meteorological stations measuring more than 30 years.
On Thursday, the record was recorded for only nine long measuring stations.
Perhaps the present temperature in the Watchtower was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In the Lednica in Breclavsk today, 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four degrees and in the Inferences in Brčnik, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three degrees.
Both records came from 2013.
High temperatures today appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Watch Tower was the largest water in the Dyjakovici in Znojemska and Brodá nad Dyj nad Břeclavska, where the mercury was duly sprayed to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not exceed.
On the other hand, for example, in western and northwestern Czech Republic, the ČHMU web site has so far been the highest temperatures of only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there began to grow until this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current weather in the Czech Republic will gradually decline according to the CHMMU, and more rains may occur on Sunday.
Most Morava sites, however, will remain high temperatures on Friday and in the south-east of Morava on Saturday.
We've had this mess here.
The billionaires do not have the same voice in elections as any single adult in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not everyone is as bold as Andrey Babish, who wants to own a state, buys political parties.
The owner of Penty Marek is sponsoring the realists of Robeyski together with other colleagues on the water Martin Burdou and Anton Frycz.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of insurance and by the entrepreneur in the realities of Pavel Sehnal, who is also the president.
The convicted corrupter and the king of Czech gambling, Ivo Valenta, ordered the Private Party.
The political movement of Agrofert, as the Andrej Babiše project was reluctant to name the cross-border mayor Jaroslav Germany, is a chapter for himself.
Their billionaires have been captured by the Old Ages too.
It's the Dalibor Grandpa, the owner of the company for the Jablotron security facility.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
Entrée in an old-fashioned dress, but it didn't work out very well for the Pope.
"I never set small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is to move the ANO to move the Old Age to get twenty percent in elections.
Leckdo's a puzzle.
But the grandfather's rejection is more significant.
The billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to hold the votes of the electors in the Old Ages, he continues to support Andreje Babis.
Grandfather, in his previous parliamentary elections, supported him.
"Dabus is not a sharp speaker and does not have a favorite comic of political snakes," he wrote before the 2013 elections.
But he certainly doesn't go into politics because he wants to improve himself.
Babi's gonna be a hero to me.
He's willing to step out of his world under control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the elders introduced her as a new force, he came back from his visit to Babish.
And he said he wanted the Elders to learn how to cooperate with Babi.
Some may estimate that Grandpa does not change his mind and stand by his dress regardless of what he wears.
Others may speculate if Babi is sending the Elders to build his flock of someone so unstable.
Another question may be asked whether Jablotron's boss and Agrofer's boss should have gone wrong in the shop and not been looking for another way to defend their business rival.
The first Pope's public performance, but it wasn't just around Babi.
Grandpa promised he'd send ten million crowns to the mayor's campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard for anyone to stop over a similar sentence.
The other court-martialed winner Zdeněk Bacala, before the 2010 elections, scattered millions on all sides.
The political division of the security agencies of Vita Barty, TOP 09 and the citizens of the Democrats have all come together to a total of thirty million.
It's just another time today.
The law prohibits any political party from giving more than three million.
At least as soon as Grandpa got into politics, he could be a little shy about the rules of the game.
Maybe then he doesn't have to ask himself why our policy has such a bad reputation.
His first days in politics then he crowned the proposal for tax benefits for families with studied children.
People with high school education will come to our home about fifty thousand a month.
I'll base you on a few 20s.
A man with fifty thousand is rich in the present.
The one with the twenty poor.
In Santa Claus’s vision, poor companies are paying taxes and rich people benefit from the functioning of the social state, which they do not share.
The rich need to help them not to give up on their needs.
The seniors can congratulate each other on their new acquisitions, and Babies can use their hands.
The rest of us can, thanks to the Pope, confirm that billions are not good people.
Then there's another question left to choose.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who are neither members nor members of their own country nor nationals of a State shall not be their employees nor their own country.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich land for all people, not just some.
No one wanted the trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to cost 234 million.
Selling real estate is sometimes not easy.
And sometimes he won't even be able to help 11 beds, a wonderful view of the sea, or the fact that the property is selling the president of the United States Donald Trump.
At the sale of the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price went down on incredible 8 million pounds.
He reported on this website Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Avoid the place like no other.
Even though the association of a real company with the US president was not an extreme price.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean home by an incredible 8 million pounds.
The original real estate price was 21.5 million pounds, the final price fell to 13 million pounds.
Even after the discount, the villa complex stands at about 76 average apartments in central Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
The charming 5 acre settlement on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 fully suitable bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, gyms and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
Part of the land is also a swimming pool and tennis court.
There are dozens of palm trees planted on the ground.
There's a beautiful view of the sea from the terrace.
Realistically, the price showed that connection with the President is not sufficient to attract potential buyers.
Now real estate is closer to the usual prices of real estate on the island.
Trump bought property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about 15 million pounds.
The real estate was to buy for rent purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
With a new price, it's going to be in a second place.
The property in the neighborhood was estimated at 13.5 million pounds.
The NSAA decided to end two workouts a day.
Nineteenths of the morning and players of UCLA's American football are playing at the side line of the new school game.
Some of them take their clothes off and reveal the slow back, the unmistakable sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most of these team members, a few minutes of work is scheduled for the afternoon break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to rooms after a three-hour training course to study for final exams before returning to the Waterman Football Center for a meeting that will take place next morning at 6:30 p.m.
"For these boys, the next three days will be a proper hangover," said coach Bruins Jim Mora a moment before it broke up on Tuesday.
By removing two trains in one day, the NSAA wants to relax the players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least by Friday, when the final tests are completed.
That's why the first three UCLA workouts are planned at 19:15 - to be energized into so many student diaries already overcrowded.
At first, in the six seasons that Mora spent on the position of coach in Westwood, the Bruins training camp starts a week before last year and the training is limited during the summer semester. It also has a decision to limit the number of trainings from two to one day.
A total of eighteen training sessions are scheduled until 20 August, starting with formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
It has to be heard that it supports the decision of the NSAA, even though it has added another item to the already busy player diaries.
"The players are under great stress for three or four days and it is very exhausting for them," said Mora.
"But nobody gave up, everyone's trying, they're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the training camp has ended, which will not be easy to see from a clear line of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and luxury hotel Luskin Center, which has occupied players after the installation of a protective network behind the fence.
The Bruins players should have the hotel sat down starting this week, but Mora admits that when the rooms are empty during the season, there might be a problem.
"The Land will guard the security service," Mora added.
“The security is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our trainings.
He's doing a good deal with that stuff.
The hotel will be lucky to watch protection, as well as parking lot No. 8.
Let's use our resources as much as possible.
I believe everything's gonna be okay.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans a more thorough verification of the facts to limit the number of false reports
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to control third parties and display findings under the original contributions in an effort to fight the so-called "fake news", the largest social network reported on Thursday.
The company in the statement on its website writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which will send third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the survey under the original contributions.
Facebook has been identified as one of the main sources of false reports, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports have influenced the last presidential election of the United States.
In Europe, political debate is on the whole. French voters are flooded with false reports about the May presidential elections, and Germany plans ahead of the January elections to put a stop to the social media network if it does not quickly eliminate angry contributions.
Facebook stated on Thursday in his next statement in Germany that it is about to run a new verification function for false reports in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying reports verified by third parties, people are asking for more content to be better informed and able to decide correctly what they can share,” stated on their blog Sara Su, a product manager of Facebook news.
She added that Facebook continues to test the "related articles" function and also works on other changes to reduce the number of false reports.
Graphical novel design: story of A Castle in England
The small castle of Scotty Castle recently played the main role in the Squeeze music video clip and found its refuge in it also Margaret Thatcher during the 70th and 80th centuries.
Scotty, however, was from his hideous place at the Bewl River in the British Kent witness to 700 years of stormy history, which inspired a strange Jamie Rhodes from the York County, a well-known landmark in historical documents, to create graphic novels.
"Look at the letter of a man who fascinates me 300 years after his death," says Rhodes with an important face.
"When I hold a letter, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the life of families who lived in the castle of Scotty from the Middle Ages to the Eduardian period. Every story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first Rhodes' book of inspired archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teath and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documents from the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"He took me to the print of a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for Jakobity," he said.
"It's his finger print!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to burn a candle to read.
When I come to the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone so fascinated by old papers, support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of staying in the castle for almost four months is almost like a dream. ("To tell the truth, I have stayed a little longer.")
Rhodes spent time examining the Victorian "new" castle, passing archives and studying many treasures and curious, such as the head of hyenas on the wall and the bottles that were buried after centuries in the cemetery.
He walked through the land and examined the ruins of the old castle, spoke to strange, gardeners, and sometimes with artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
At night, he drank whiskey and wrote.
The trust story of Scotty is relatively unknown, as the National Trust organization gained access to documents until 2006 after the death of the last legacy, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the employees began to search into the archives that Rhodes described as "the aristocrats of many centuries spread their hands with the words, "Know it in the undergarments."
Diniks, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps depicting property: "You may think the plot of land is boring," said Rhodes, "but I struck one case when two families took over the bridge.
Let the people go!"
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a reflection bridge, and the trick is deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, who follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English uprising in 1381.
"I found a record of the castle's defense in 1380, which was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
"The English uprising actually started in this area and I thought the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe it's kind of connected."
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest, who hid Darrell's family seven years after the English reform.
Or The Smuggler on an 18th-century passenger named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled out the rock's shell (which was found up to several years after the discovery of the shell).
Rhodes’s favorite family are Darrellov: “I was intrigued by the male generation — the men then were always indebted and lost money for things they could not afford.
The different generations of Darrell's family solved it by taking rich or old pancakes - I imagine it was the sights of the gentlemen, who had the imagination of the heads of the heirs."
With the end of the stay at the castle, four Rhodes after another adventure.
He recently returned from a two - week train station in the Finnish wilderness, where he inspired his next book about Elämenmäki, which was a former sanatorium from the beginning of the 20th century that was buried by nature.
But it's a special place for Scottney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said, 'Now let me go back to real life.'
Washington changes the conditions for making a green card
The media has published President Donald Trump's words on the new U.S. immigration plan, in which there will also be a change in the granting of a green card.
It is assumed that the number of legal immigrants will fall by 50 000 per year as a result of stricter rules for the provision of temporary work visas and the limitation of family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars for taxpayers. We aim at changing the rules for issuing green tickets to the residents of other countries.
The law limits the number of immigrants and replaces the current scheme.
The new application process is a priority for English-speaking applicants who are in financial resources and will demonstrate the skills that will benefit our country," Trump, quoted by the media, said.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be watching
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report on the Internet on the technological development of sexual robots appeared.
Yes.
Sexual robots are really popular at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artistic intelligence at the Sheffield University and co-founder FRR Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to take a serious look at the rise of sexual robots.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the chin and the look of the robot's nails.
"People are hiding from them, but they are growing, and we need to be prepared to see them as often as possible," Sharkey reported on the occasion of the release of the report.
Modern sexual aid is changing from inflaming you to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to touch - of course is artificial intelligence that resembles human behavior.
The user can "correct" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and shape of the beard to the look and color of the nails.
It is very disturbing, however, that many robots have their own "personality", which would insult the Stepford Panic.
Modern inflamed girls developed into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set his replacement women different character drawings, including shyness.
And then here is the sex robotic wife of Roxxy Gold True Companion, which is delivered with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah", which is characterized by a shy nature and "wild Wendy" with a "good social" character.
"The personality of Roxxy Gold is set to reflect your personality to the maximum possible extent," writes True Companion.
So she likes what you like, and she likes what you like.
She's even ready, just like people.
It can be tired, loud or "in the mood".
The rise of sexual robots is alarming immediately for a number of reasons - among which there is no substitute for real interlinked relationships. Concerns are more of the inferior women's character traits and violent attacks - e.g. frigid (read insulting) Farrah.
True Companion on its websites compares Roxxxy to a male vibrator.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why couldn't she have a husband of Roxxy?" she says on the page.
However, sexual robots are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their creation and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeper rooted in our culture - away from the ideal or sexual equality towards passion for subhuman sex with optional approach.
Most men, of course, do not buy a robotic woman and while FRR is talking about their growing popularity, sexual robots are still at the edge of the public interest.
However, this district interest can become a mirror of the present modern age.
And most people aren't weird or violent until they've got a free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sexual robots appear at a time when women all over the world are gaining their rights and sitting in the White House is the president, who is often very shy at the woman's address.
The most frightening aspect of the series The story of the ministry is not what we see - the twisted bodies and the twisted eyes, as the reality of these visions.
The book Story of the Servant represents a step in the right direction, but at present it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots should be as much like the real women as possible (although with porno-heroes).
Their creators build them so that they are nice to touch and act on the first look as a real woman.
However, when it comes to their "personality", the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing that would boost their independence or disrupt their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they're nice slaves.
According to the 21st century: official.
NBA star on the green duck.
Curry's fighting in California about the cut.
The star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose out despite the packed first fire at the opening of the premiere among professional golfers.
The double rating holder for the most unfavourable NBA player played the Ellie Mae Classic lower series Web.com Tour in California Hayward's first round for 74 races and will fight for cut.
The Golden State player, who won the second title of the Warriors team in the NBA this season, started very nervously and his first waste ended in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at fairway.
Even after that, he was not as precise as under basketball basketball, yet behind him, with the balance sheet, four wounds over a couple left a dozen professionals.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, I had to call the judge immediately after the first fire, but then I sat down a little," Curry said, saying that he had been hit by a huge three.
It was very nervous, to fire the first wound on the tournament, but it was all I hoped for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd read it right away," he added.
If Currym is able to fight with a shoe that is likely to be two wounds under the pair, he will become the first representative of another sport that he can do on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play the next better, and now that I'm out of trouble, maybe it will go," said the enthusiastic golfer, who was already playing in the tournaments of celebrities and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, it's the first to start a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he gained a sponsoral exception and maintained an amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is about one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
Against that, Mitt Romney is a healthy man of mind.
The Trumpo era is an unmistakable sign of political divide that divides American voters, and in micro measure, the whole family is also breaking up.
During Christmas and Thanksgiving, it was the advice in American newspapers to consult relatives who choose Trump.
Guess we're just waiting for the nerves to let us.
However, less attention is devoted to Trump's family's ability to stifle.
I'm talking about it because this week my cousin visited me in New York, a poet and left fan who lives in Chicago and who paid for the Republican stupidity in our family for a long time.
She reminded me that in the face of a common enemy, loneliness can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, there is a whole family - including all the Republican peers who have been fighting about politics for years - on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it's a good thing; but it impresses me that in a broader context, it poses a significant risk.
Trump is pushing the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all away.
If we are talking about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the frightening possibility that his crafts may one day lose their attractiveness.
There is, however, an even more horrendous long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the regular Republicans, who, contrary to his standards, will be surprised by what can be called rational.
Today, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy conversation - a dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (although we were aware of his tax admission) - both of which seem to be compared to Trump as a very small crime.
After Trump's departure, the next Republican candidate will be at least normal, which will be an irreplaceable improvement.
We used my sister's visits and took the children to Central Park for the biggest roundabout that operates the New York Park Department - for your three dollars you won't find a better use if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are amazing, the middle warrior is covered with clumsies - clowns and animals are filming and in fear of their own shoulders - a completely cloudy view and zinc music of the shopping industry reminds the public.
A lot of clichés will soon come to mind: the view of the high buildings, the panoramas will watch, instead of breathing the atmosphere and the reality of the city will not be given to your performances.
About fifty years later, I still did not pass through the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually Swiss cheese - it does not count the thematic home of Ye Old Swiss Cottage - but the metro station in London.
However, the tour of Central Park has a remarkable magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, as well as two mature women, will have great fun.
If I could score the score, I'd deserve the maximum points, but no one's lucky.
This week, I experienced a similar experience in the shop when I was asked to assess my "injection" on a scale from one to five on a payment credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same thing, with the difference that I can measure 15% clean for something I'm going to buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down another fast sale, but the waiter is so forced to dive into the nice buyers when it's not necessary.
The woman in the store smiled at me when I was reluctant to evaluate my credit card transfer with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius had to be transferred to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cutting wounds on the wrist, which, according to the statement of the prison, caused himself to fall into a trap.
The Pistorios was convicted of murder after the appeal against the original sentence for murder.
He killed his girlfriend Steinkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of the toilet box in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have confused her with a thief.
The complainants announced their intention of revoking the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too modest.
The National Prosecuting Authority stated that it is referring to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the trial will take place again this year.
In the event of success, Pistorios is threatened with a penalty of up to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in the South African Republic.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a young captive panda, who had fallen into a wild place.
It's a huge success for the rescue program.
The Centre is trying to expand the geno-funds of those held in custody.
Čang Č-chung's staff informed the New China agency that the herd of the panda is at great risk of being hit by the relatives' cross.
In the arrest, only 471 people lived at the end of last year.
Only two thousand of them survive in the wild.
Trying to get the cops trapped with those savages to be the first step in protecting this species.
Fifteen-year-old Cchao-cchao was released to the natural reservation at the beginning of the Pandhi parish on 11 March.
Thanks to the monitoring device on the neck, the scientists could observe every step of it.
His elected Chao-Cchao met 12 days later.
The sexual relationship with the male was a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because the pandas are not considered to be the most successful pet kingdom.
Males are relatively poor to estimate the time when females are ready, and in addition, they are often confused and unaware of what to do.
A young woman was born healthy and, given that Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, she weighed 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of the newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, was detained on 1 August in the early hours of the Zithonian police.
All of them were released the same day, but the investigation continued.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated for bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have stepped up the rules of free campaigning and impose strict sanctions on anyone who is caught in a place where the campaign is not allowed.
Controls will take place throughout the season.
The Ministry has stated that the court may bring an action.
Spilk is the first round of British Open in the 50th place.
Golfist Klara Spilk appears after the first round of British Open in the 50th place.
The playing field in the Scottish Kingsbarns circled the score one hit under the pair when she played three times the Bird and twice the bogey.
A 20-year-old Czech player has the hope that a famous major will be the first to go through with his mouth.
The top American star Michelle Wieov, who won the first round in the 64-run record, was awarded a $1.25 million prize, which is eight pairs.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands bring millions of toxic eggs out of the market.
As a result of the incident, the Netherlands alone has temporarily closed 180 greenhouse gases.
The Netherlands Food Safety Authority of NVWA reported that it investigates 20 per cent of all Dutch poultry species, which it considers 80 per cent of eggs on the market are unconventional.
The Authority stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of egg types identified by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substances in eggs is small and does not pose a risk for adults, but the potential threat is for children.
Czech SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also joined in the closure of cattle, have not been able to move to the Czech Republic lately.
However, veterinarians will take samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on which the problem signs of insecticide have appeared on the market.
The eggs from Belgium were last in April and the eggs from the Netherlands last in May, according to the veterinary administration in the Czech market.
The chicken meat from Belgium was last found in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of preparations against biles, all and cliques.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO World Health Organization considers it to be a bit toxic.
His high doses lead to a feeling of anxiety and rejection.
Riga's beautiful, I'm going to miss her, she's called the Golman Sedláček and she's looking for an engagement.
I'd like to catch another ten years.
"Maybe I'll come back there once," said the 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the blue dress.
It depends if a new year's engagement takes place before the start of the year.
What were the four years you lived in Lotysch?
If I were to evaluate it as in school, like in three.
The first year I didn't catch much, I had an experienced golman in front of me.
I've learned.
The second year I started to catch.
I thought they'd give me more space before the third season.
But they brought in a new golman I met again.
Last year, I assumed I'd be caught all the time.
But during the initial ten matches, we got only five points, so the coaches started to do it.
At the end of the day, my colleague was caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play him next season.
What was life in Rize?
It's beautiful.
It's little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we'll get married next year.
So I brought something.
How demanding is KHL for the whites?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are men like us or Slovan who have to change their game style against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing back, fighting back.
I didn't see a problem in the field.
The difference is that the Russians want to play empty.
They shoot less, and even though they have a half-empty white front, they prefer to record.
In the Czech Republic, there's only more shooting.
Didn't you have a problem traveling and moving over seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is mostly done so you need to play four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Lotys get their club in KHL?
Like a national team.
The whole lotysko is watching hockey, with basketball it's national sport.
Fans all of them.
Even though it didn't happen, a lot of people went.
Did the action of Dinam in KHL help to ensure that Lotyshska at the world's championship this year had almost reached a quarter-final?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time, their results on the world's championships began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in a quarter-final with Canada close to 1:2.
That was an inconvenient result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech extraligy.
Roberts Bukarts passed through Zlina and Ralfs Freibergs was signed before the contract.
How come there's so many of them coming here?
They're no beech players, they're really good.
The teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Lotys among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL is starting in three weeks.
Why are you still not engaged?
At the beginning of February, I knew I wouldn't go on in Rize.
That's where we started looking for something.
She was on Sparta's desk.
But because they didn't have a golman budget, we didn't agree.
Then it was classic.
We were dealing with different teams that decided in the finals for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlina and I'm gonna wait for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous?
That was four years ago when I left and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, I'm on the other side of the house for a while.
I picked up something in KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The question just sounds like when and where to sign.
How real is the variant that you're going to have a new anniversary in Zlina?
The state can do anything.
We'll see what's going to happen in a month.
Now I can just wait for the agent to make a deal.
You prefer some competition?
The late season wasn't like I could choose.
So I'm waiting on the phone.
The government's taking off at the Air Force.
In January of this year, I wrote about the summer camp in Orlík, in article S of the care of the proper economy.
The bottom line of the problem remains the same, and I will allow the complainants to remind me of the article.
He's been talking about the summer camp for years.
For readers who don't know exactly what's going on, it'll probably be best if they look at the official cultural sites of the Pietni Metti.
In the introduction of the historical survey, it is found that the camp stood two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that it served as a labor camp from 8.8. 1940, that from 1.1. 1942 it was a collective camp, and that from 2.8. 1942 it became a Cicanian camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including non - Indian conditions, until March 1943, when the first annual prisoners were assigned to the lighting transport.
On 4.5.1943, 370 persons were transported to the main transport camp.
There were 420 of them all.
The very sad story of the incalculable suffering of human beings, which caused them to be again human beings and repudiated ideologies.
There is no dispute about the need to keep these events in mind.
There is no argument that this reminder should be played at the memorial site of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
After socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970 ’ s, it was built in the vicinity of the former camp in February.
The history of the camp was discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, a memorial was discovered in 1995 in Letech.
By the mid-1990s, the government had promised to redeem and repatriate the summer, but it didn't happen until now.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural memory and since 2009 its administration is under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the United Nations Committee on Human Rights called on the Czech Republic to close on Friday.
So closely the facts of the camp's military verdict.
When February in the fall the government approved the ransom of February and decided to draw up a search warrant to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy it off in spring.
According to Herman's Minister of Culture, "some numbers exist, but I'd probably dream of going public with them."
We'll see what the expert will bring.
According to some unofficial estimates, hundreds of millions can be lost, others say the price can be up to billion.
So it's not going to be cheap in any case.
And yet only a few hundred meters from the former camp is a monument to which the state has invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction was beautifully financed by the UN Committee on Human Rights, which is not likely to be a threat, I believe it would be the same as spending money.
Does the government have any other priorities?
A memorial, a dignified place of pilgrimage, the will of history is practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that has taken place, and anyone who wishes can present the memories of the victims and the victims here.
I don't see any reason to change this!
Let's just keep it the way it is, and let's keep the fifth place safe.
In this case, the responsible person, the Czech Government's Government, should treat the taxable person with the care of the proper economy.
At least with someone like your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Vice-President of the Government are not the whole government.
But I can still see from the above facts the password of the leader of the UN movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This year, in May, I went to look directly at the place.
Very decent arrival route, adjusted parking space, replicas of wooden camp bars.
In one exhibition, in the second integrated toilet with running water.

All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as appropriate and belonging to.
Archaeological research is currently being carried out at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would be possible, for example, for a part of the discovered bases to be observable and, at least, to make at least a visual approach.
This way he could exert his efforts by the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman.
In the event that he succeeds in the government to purchase a ransom for government money last year, it will only be another unfortunate step in his already sufficiently problematic action as a minister of culture.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate may reduce symptoms of inflammation of the stomach (IBD)
For your eating system, red meat and milk products can be a nightmare.
However, the new study points to the right opposite: food rich in animal protein and milk products could help to eliminate symptoms of inflammatory stomach disease.
Untreated disease, which affects up to 1.3 million U.S. population and 300,000 patients in the United Kingdom, causes stomach and blood transfusions, weight loss, and extreme vomiting.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and milk products to mitigate symptoms. Researchers at Washington University found, however, that the essential amino acid triptofan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that support the stamina resistance.
Dr. Marco Colonna's study explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the removal of harmful microbes from food.
The number of activated cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerances and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
As soon as the muscles bend to the side of the inflammation, they may develop an inflammatory bowel disease.
During the research, scientists have identified the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerances in the stomach with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan cells - one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the stomach microbial and the development of cells that support body tolerances.
The more triptophans had mice in their diet, the more these immune cells had."
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then the combination of L. reuterium bacteria and food rich in tryptophans would help to develop a more susceptible and less active stomach environment.
The postgraduate researcher Dr. Luis Cervantes-Barraganwas in a study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerances found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of mice of the same species of kept cells lost.
It led to the fact that one group of mice has different wheat microbes - a community of bacteria, viruses and lungs that usually reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse tree was tested by a method of DNA sorting, and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that lost the second group of mice.
The mice that were kept in the sterile environment and were missing wheat microbes - so this type of immune cells did not emerge - were given L. reuterium bacteria - and created immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers grew L. Reuters in fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to unsaturated immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immune cells developed into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active substance from the liquid, it was shown that it was a product of a triptophan metabolite known as indolyl-3-octaic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of tryptophans in a nutshell, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent. After dividing the dose of tryptophan, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us are keeping L. Reuters bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the side products of tryptophan from L. Reuters cause the development of cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in the genes related to tryptophan were detected in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably try to develop these cells because they control the activity of the internal surface of the intestines.
The potentially high level of tryptophan in the presence of L. Reuters bacteria may increase the cell population."
José Mourinho considers the signing of a contract with Non-Mate and his transition to Manchester United as "genial"
Manchester United won his team "genia" in the form of Nemnja Matić - at least that's what José Mourinh thinks after the hostage debuted in the mid-term fight against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed the 40 million-lib agreement, entered into the first match of 2-1 in Dublin - the last pre-season match before UEFA Superpohar, where the United met with Real Madrid on Tuesday - and took part in his role as a depositary on the side of Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matić did not have the form and played only 45 minutes, according to Mourinha's words, before the start of the next Premier League season.
"It takes time, but it is experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mind - thinking football," Maurin said.
"We'll help him get into the condition as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new associates Victor Lindelöf and Romel Lukak also played the first match at the Aviva Stadium and Maurin started to form their eleven for the next season.
The independent source announced this week that Maurin still wants to sign a contract with the other three players, but insists that the club has taken "fantastic work" and brought into the team three of the four most important players.
"Thanks to the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
"Four out of four would have pleased me more, but I admit that they have done the maximum for me."
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins Lady Hrushka.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This multi-purpose image began to be painted thanks to a new series on the Prima Zdenko Academy.
Hruška immediately blew up the chance.
"Dear Zdeňka, I would like to apply to this in your cooking academy, because, hand to heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he called him in a video on the social network.
And because these two guys have been spying on each other for a few years, he hasn't forgotten the Lord's power this time.
"In return, I can teach you sweaty from diet chicken, american chicken or invite you to water and show you why it's a favorite roasted cheese," Hruška said.
His participation in Pohlreich's new show is really serious.
It's time to move up and learn from the master.
"The question is, what's the boss's point," said Blake.
Pohlreich, however, did not express himself because he made a new part of his next series, Yes, boss!
Only Prima reacted to the participation of Hrušky at the Culinary Academy by taking the whole issue as his personal activity that goes beyond television.
In December 2004, Hruška Pohlreich founded her first cook.
It was sold over 300 thousand pieces in a few days!
The new show that Prima presented yesterday at the press conference on the sub-synthetic broadcasting schedule is an unforgivable cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from a number of spectators and in 12 parts he is familiar with 12 cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now the boss cooks in November 2014 Zdeněk on the back of his trick let himself ride the overcrowded torch.
If my face was there, I'd laugh a lot.
"Now I'm just laughing at the pussies - the pus is healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Ladja responded.
He's thinking about the Lady's culinary art.
"To read according to Lady Hrushky does not come into consideration at home, because I will not leave a gastropunk at home," he says.
Pohlreich's boobs I really appreciate, even according to him, I'm making chicken on honey.
In my order, but his recipes will certainly not appear," Hruška refused.
He's an asshole!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic illiterate or stupid," said Pohlreich about Croatia at one lecture.
"It's not my twenty to get my hands on them, but I can't handle them anymore," said Hruška.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to take off the car and the house by hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip pointing to the body. With a simple hand-cuff, he can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Three decades old Steven Northham has let a small chip implant between thumb and index and currently offers the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the implementation and maintenance of treatment procedures.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a service for the exchange of doors and cars, compatible with a microchip. The price of one lock is £300.
A married father of one child has allowed technology to be integrated into his home and his car with BMW Z4, which launches with a simple wrist.
White House Recruitment has turned the taxpayers into thousands of dollars
The White House's decision to fly with the South Lawn Navy helicopter to celebrate the American manufacturing industry, which took place last month, came according to the shipping records issued by the TIME Week for $24,000.
The green white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also known as Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the top of the program from 17 July in the White House, which was a review of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence, and several senior officials of the White House were looking at a review of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter from Connecticut was displayed next to Maine yachts, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a visible lift from Mississippi.
The military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order or FRAGO and requested the presence of helicopters not more than 36 hours before the arrival of a helicopter on South Lawn in the context of the “extraordinary” event, reported the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for helicopter management.
“I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event,” said Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to his superior, commander of the Air Force for the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn on 17 July at approximately 7:00 for the occasion of the inspection, the start of which is scheduled at 15:00 and will remain in place until the complete clearance of the entire site planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
In the e-mail, it was further stated that if a replacement crew is sent for return flights due to the Working Time Regulation when it leaves the White House.
The original crew stayed on the scene that evening with the helicopter and with them also a unit of security workers.
Of the records - which the TIME weekly received - it was not clear if the second crew was finally sent out.
The Hatch Act prohibits state officials from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this Regulation.
"We wondered if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was all right," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're being blocked," said the deputy commander.
This review "Made in America" was marked by the White House as an official event, and the Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But official events also have political subtexts.
In his participation in the event, the President advocated a medical reform that was passed by the Senate and spoke of an effort to maintain the rule of law.
The use of aviation means such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is a difficult new phenomenon.
The presidents are using them when they travel.
However, their presence is unusual for presentation reasons.
Trump ordered control in February after the President's plane went in the background during his first meeting in the Melbourne campaign in Florida. His Twitter account is charged with complaints about the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft.
"The White House is pleased with the ‘Made in America’ review, which presented products from all 50 states producing American materials," said the representative of the press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in Washington and South Lawn and practice possible occasions with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum precision.
While Trump attended the G-20 Group Summit at the beginning of July, HMX-1 performed 58 exercises at the White House.
A year to review Made and America was part of the current crew training, the state factor stated.
The helicopter unit flew on the same day under the "unpresidential support missions" for another eleven hours.
The White House stated that no further reservations had been made from taxpayers' money.
Sikorsky spokesperson stated that the company was not interested in any way in the talks on the exhibition of a helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for the presidential years and precise costs in relation to the survey are difficult to determine, according to the shipping statement.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017, DoD's reimbursement for VH-3D $24,380 per year.
The unit records indicate 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters are significantly below that amount.
"Introducing the costs of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement of expenditure is very misleading," Walters said to the whole thing.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in annual costs."
According to the 2015 RAND study, DoD’s reimbursements do not include staff costs, but include fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
The then White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter for inspection purposes.
"The idea of a review that will be held this week is to introduce products produced in the USA," Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and Connecticut state are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our state’s defence and that they provide jobs to hundreds if not to thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we're proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which there are not many American citizens.
This fact is to be recalled."
It's not clear if Trump was also looking at a helicopter during his walk to South Lawn.
Back in the White House Trump spoke to Sikorsky's representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I'm alone now three."
The young woman tied up in the bay at Mach's lake, the police sailed to her.
The girl went out to the beach on Sunday about the second hour of the morning.
Instead of buying, she was stuck in the swamps.
When she decided to request a cell phone for police help, she had the last 12 percent of her battery.
"That's why policemen soon lost contact with her," said police spokesman Ivan Baláková.
A number of police guards went to the place she described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the policemen had to fry with the racosal wetlands hundreds of meters before they felt a solid ground under their feet again," Balákova approached.
And so was she wrong.
The police were directed by the direction from which her call for help came.
"In order not to come up with at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count out loud," the speaker said.
Police found a woman up to three quarters to five in the bays in the town of Borny.
She was on the edge of physical and psychological forces and showed signs of coldness.
That's why she was taken to a hospital in Czechoslovakia.
The Pope's Association with Stan?
The requested bride becomes a saleswoman.
That's a little irony.
In its web project, we're looking for a billion volunteers, basically saying that STAN is suffering from a lack of decent people.
He also stated that the political party does not have any country-wide program for the election of the House of Commons, but rather less well-known concerns and independent ones.
Her election candidate will only become a decent person after the interview with the Pope, regardless of his political opinion.
That's how Vit Bart started, and it didn't work out very well.
In addition to his hunt for decent people and personalities, which may be replaced by some elders, which he also admitted by Gazdík, Grandpa is also undermining the favorite argument of chief Stan that the greatest value of movement is just political verification and experimentation, traditionally the most popular policy and according to research.
You are now quietly exposing the quickly collected unknown personalities.
The total break with the people, after which Stan changed the logo and slogan, the Gazdík also explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if the STAN of identity had only a few suspects at the time, after the arrival of the Pope only ends the game of identity.
Not only did Gazdík defend himself for a long time against the ANO Andrej Babiš, but Grandpa, who publicly praised him, stated: "My goal is to move the ANO, then the Old Age movement won twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't make a move.
Grandpa is a successful businessman and a billionaire is certainly not an accident.
He often talks about politics like Babish, unlike him, but he doesn't build his own political brand.
Stan's been remembering more reality show than a real political party for a while, and Dad's helping hand as if she'd been doing more than a sales girl since the bride's request.
For some time, Stan went with TOP 09, then with people, and now he's looking for decent people to change.
Let's hope someone gets back to us.
Police dogs trained in the Bridge by a helicopter
Dogs specializing in search of explosives and hunting dogs today practiced at Lake Must overflight by helicopter.
The police dog must not be shy and be afraid of flying, said the leading police cynics of the Uztek region, Petr Tomášek.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At Most, they practiced how adult dogs are trained, so those who are only passing through the training.
In addition to the standard training, in which they were to detect sharp samples of explosives in the vicinity of the lake and to search for a lost figure, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
In order for the helicopter to be able to work the dog immediately so that he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter.
"The old helicopter, the dog goes and is looking for it," said Tomášek.
A dog who is restless or who is unable to start working right away is expelled from training.
"Most of them then leave them in the garden, for example," Tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs with different specialties in the Uztek region.
They rule the German sheep, but also the Belgian sheep.
The password's been keeping him from the puppy.
"He educates himself, prepares himself for the service that a dog will do for us," Tomášek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations which may reveal any medical handicrafts.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, the first test is in 20 months.
"To the sharp impact is about two and a half to three years," Tomášek added.
The length of service with the police depends on the health status of the dog.
Most of them serve within eight to ten years.
Then they experience most of their passwords.
Trailer at the 3rd Narcos season: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the Wednesday of the Netflix emergency series
Despite the conclusion of the second Narcos season, when Pablo Escobar's killer was discovered, the Netflix series is not far away.
Confirmation by the streaming service has already reached the third and fourth seasons - firstly, the name has already reached the first trailer and the origin of other opposition posts.
In the third season, DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential farmers, they operate "as a company from Fortune 500" with only the difference that they scale violent acts and pay more government agents.
Gilberto Rodriguez Oreuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Oreuela (Francisco Denis) plays brain operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Amman) is concerned about the connection with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a verbizing American and Colombian rights defender in the fight against drugs.
Among the other players are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third Narcos season will take place on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections may be credible only if all members of the company, including women, have been appointed by the UN representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, the leader of the United Nations Relief Mission, said that the election to local representations is involving hundreds of women, three women are taking care of the post of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered volunteers are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he stated in his mid-term statement.
Elections may be fully representative and credible only in the event that they are involved with women, as well as all related processes associated with elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban has issued several threats to the electoral process, which moves the international fighting activity on the other hand.
In the elections this year, for the first time, one democratically elected government transmits its power to a peaceful next government.
Haysom stated that strong women's role is strengthening Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan independent electoral commission stated that a total of 3.6 million registered volunteers made up 1.2 million women.
The unique beer cooks beer again.
For a good beer to a re-caught beer.
The inspiration and sincerity of the new owners returned a few years ago to the life of the brewer in Lobči near Mšena.
Bivovar, mentioned for the first time in 1586, has a renaissance core and in the 19th century was converted into a parascopy operation.
She followed the years of flowering when the beer was pronounced mainly by dark beer.
Unfortunately, the production was stopped during World War II and a brewer was born in 1984.
Since then, buildings have been used by the state ship.
The loss was done by the brewers after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and broken into building materials.
In 2007, however, new hopes in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Paul Prouzov.
These buildings began to repair with maximum respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
Carefully dedicated and devoted to the study of archival materials, they try to preserve original materials and building elements.
Bivovar has the same shape as in the 19th century, when its golden era began.
Their work has been appreciated by the declaration of brewery as a cultural memory by the Ministry of Culture and the construction has also become part of the European industry heritage tracks.
In 2015, the tradition of cooking beer was celebrated.
If you want to taste a great Lobečian beer in the picturesque Kokořínska region, visit the brewery area.
In the cooking of beer, they use coconut water that is found in protected rural areas, sugar from lobbying fields and javelin clouds.
You enjoy a traditional light bed, but also dark beer and specialties.
And don't let yourself be seen by a brewer, it happens on Saturdays and Sundays in the afternoons and in the second half.
The biggest distillery of Czechoslovakia?
One of the greatest strengths of his type in the whole world?
Such a unique building should have been the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Jacler, at the top of the plot over the village of Babi.
It was originally to be made up of up to twelve bunkers connected with extensive underground.
There should be a department, wife, ammunition, materials, electricity, machinery and hospitals.
But the construction ended the Munich Agreement.
In the next few years, this was how the only possible iron concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were destroyed.
Thanks to the fans from Spolka Stachelberg, who began to rebuild a unique building in the early 1990s, you can look here too.
The ground has already been made available by 75%!
The part of the area is apart from the T-S 73 twine with the exhibition and underground and armed facility of the light-duty, two further arranged twine twine, storage and scientific path of the Trutnovski twine.
Exercising, cozy and fascinating views of the countryside are guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building was found on the list next to such monuments as the Great Chinese Wall, Traian's port at Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Nineveh and Nimruda.
Kláster Chotéšov, originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today, above all, forms a possible four-storey building of a convention above the beautiful garden.
The list he got, but unfortunately it belongs to unique buildings that threatens the decay.
But the climbers don't want to give up, and they're running a lot of action to support the monastery.
One of them is another annual dinner for the Chotěšov monastery this Saturday of the fifth of August, where Mr. Vladimir Mishik, Ivan Hlas, will show you the Shermír's performance and look at the places of beautiful spacious buildings that are usually not available.
But most of all, you enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
Do you want to look at the non-advertents in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to the Neanderthals in the Anthropos Pavilion of the Moravian Museum in Brno is looking forward to the most profound excursion to the period of stone, to the world of our ancestors.
You will find out how non-andralists have been able to perfectly balance themselves with the most diverse extreme climatic conditions, mainly by setting ice and ice ages.
Even in their simple material culture, the predators of their time were unrelentingly successful.
You will also learn how they looked like their anatomy, technological skills and hunting mind, but also their aesthetic feelings.
Don't you think you'd say that to the Neanderthals?
Let him convince himself in Brno.
The Fourteenth KELT & WORLD MUSIC Festival is held on Saturday, 5th in the Veverí Castle.
In addition to great music you will see the construction of a Celtic village, you will try the Celtic way of life including crafts, games for children and adults, enchanting, magic or ritual painting on the body.

The chef Miroslav Kalina, you will enjoy culinary specialities and regional food, enjoy music and dance performances, a rich program for children such as creative workshops, theatre, jumping castle, Smouli competition travel and, of course, a number of competitions.
Know the plant by one click.
Students with herbs and ordinary lovers of plants will help with a new, free Pl@ntNet application.
If they're interested in which plant they just hit on the walk, they'll be able to do it.
The only thing they'll have to do is take a picture of the plant and the application itself recognizes what kind it is.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the Centre for Ethics and Environmental Education in the Bratislava Mountain Park under the project The City's Secret Life Project.
The project also involved students from 50 Czech and Slovenian schools who with teachers in the database photographed the applications and added plants from their surroundings.
The newly created French app is free to download on the pages The City's Secret Life.
The main objective of the French programmers was to make the most of the people contribute to the application of their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognise.
"Children who hold a tablet or cell phone in their hands can go out into the woods," said Ivan Poláčová, coordinator of this project.
Based on sufficient quality photo of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can identify its name within a few seconds, which will then be listed under the photograph in Czech and Slovenian.
The French allowed us to translate the city's Secret Life into Slovenian and Czech.
It is therefore welcome that users contribute to the plant image that is not yet available in the database after the account is established.
"Francous will assess whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláčová said.
GMB supplies regarding investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The committees require assurance from the managers of the McVitie's dry cleaner about the long-term commitment of the factory in Glasgow.
The Scottish Board of Directors of the GMB stated that the company is currently silent about any investment in the Tollcross plant.
More than 500 employees are working in the factory, producing, besides other products and biscuits, Hobnob and Rich Tea.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, stated that over the past few years she invested more than 5 million pounds in the entire area.
She added that the staff and representatives of the committees will be "between the first informed" in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the construction company, the Scottish GMB committees expressed their concern that McVitie's "will not be granted its promises to finance and modernise production lines."
The main organizer of GMB Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the building manager regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very disturbing for our members.
There have been generations of families working here, and employees come from the local community and the area of Glasgow, where work in this factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
From the perspective of work, wages and benefits - and despite Brexit's view, rising life costs and declining slow production - needs the eastern part of Glasgow desperate prospering producer such as McVitie's."
Pladis spokesperson said: “Tollcross received a letter from the GMB only yesterday and the company issued a statement as soon as possible, because we appreciate the continuing commitment to employees and committee representatives.
Regular meetings with GMB staff and representatives in Tollcross were held two months ago and many problems were openly discussed at this meeting.
We spoke to the employees that, as in all companies operating under extremely competitive and non-existent economic conditions, we will assess our operation on a regular basis, which applies to all of our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested 5 million pounds in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and improved operations.
We appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the localities and, in any case, any changes in the operation of the factory, employees and representatives of the committees will be informed without delay."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymara's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won't let Neymara on his side after she made £189 million, so the amount needed to buy Neymara from the contract, but warned this French team of Barcelona about its record trip three years ago?
This sensational transition has developed the waters of summer transitions. Club League 1 is ready to exceed more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogby to Manchester United, who paid 89 million pounds for it last season.
After the transfer is confirmed and completed, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the best paid professional athlete in the world - after tax will take over £500 000 per week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is tainted by the way Neymar got out of his contract, despite the fact that the trusted source confirmed that the club has always tried to tell Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
However, was the football world alerted to this fact three years ago by President PSG?
When Manchester City in 2014 expressed its interest in Blaise Matudiho, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs that would be interested in converting one of the best PSG players.
"I'm not afraid because as soon as someone tries to get one of our players, then we'll definitely talk to one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they'll face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the line of thought when in summer she expressed an interest in PSG's successor, Marc Verratti.
The PSG made it clear in the sense that under no circumstances will the departure of the Italian representative be allowed. Therefore, it is possible that Barcelona will now swallow a bitter pill for its trophies with the departure of Neymara.
Who's explaining the sanctions?
Does political punishment have a broad understanding of the rules?
Donald Trump was on anti-Russia sanctions.
On the day before, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madura.
And the day before Trump wrote that China was not doing anything about the North Korean threat and that it would not go on.
And from that, it clears the idea of a penalty like a shoe break.
These things can't be thrown into one loop.
Madurova Venezuela really went on a road to dictatorship, totally.
China doesn't just act like the American president would like it.
The Russian capital is for itself.
But if anyone wanted to sum up all of this in such a way that even the ordinary will, the American, the European or the other, understood what it contains and what system of rules is based on sanctions policy, it would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump only covers what has already been found by President Obama, just giving him an implementing stamp.
So why such a distraction?
Last year, Europe was afraid that if we win the Trump American elections, we would join Putin and revoke the sanctions.
That's a terrible idea.
In practice, it's the opposite.
Trump and I don't release the sanctions, but they're introducing.
But Europe fears even more.
German Prime Minister Zypres says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
It's like the basketball are just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are neither the basket nor the EU anti-Russia sanctions.
The head of the European Commission, Juncker, again complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
Is it like they're supposed to use sanctions just so weak that they don't put anyone at risk?
A common fan of tape.
For three years he heard that the fate of the anti-Russia sanctions depended only on the implementation of the mining agreements on the Middle East in Ukraine.
It is now clear that it is about the EU's energy security.
Vomiting tape and widening.
Russia is being punished for being too fit into a place she doesn't have.
China's lost because it's getting a little high.
The Venezuelan president is punished for building a dictatorship in his country's borders.
All the punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the rules or the rules?
Andrej Babish: I don't consider working with Okamura.
Andrej Babish married, crosses the Republic with his visionary book and finalizes the electoral program.
In addition to the Pardubic region, all candidates are ready.
According to his words, he had no significant influence on them.
He even agreed to lead the Morovskolesk heitman and shadow school minister ANO Ivo Vondrak.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a MP or a hero," Babish confirmed his previous opinion.
A lot of representatives and national politicians have upset your opinion that the direct election of the mayor and the prime minister should run the locals and cities themselves, only with the managers.
Are you serious?
That's not how it was.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect the President directly, and I am convinced that we should also elect the mayors and prime ministers.
In my book, I'm not talking about disposing of the representatives, they can be there in peace.
The question is how many of them will be.
In presenting your book, what do I dream of when I sleep, I heard in my own ears that you were talking about cancelling the representations.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about a direct choice and a reduction in the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the primacy is estimated to be a bit of a building and not a big project, but she has no competence for it.
The same applies to the government that only two people, Klaus and Zeman, have ruled in our history.
Which I'm not saying they did well.
The current prime minister is not in charge, he's just slowing down the debate.
It can't work.
That's why you want to set up the majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's hard to get through.
In the program, we only have a change in a single-wheeled election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a scrupulous mandate of ministers and the amendment of the Minutes' Rules of Procedure, in order to prevent the excessive display of Members, who are to work mainly in committees and committees, from being held at the Minutes' meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the recording with 101 MPs, destroy both the Senate and, through grateful care and primacy, you will control the entire country.
I'm sure it's not.
There is nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
The French President Macron has announced a reduction in the third-party legislature, while there are 57 thousand French lawyers, while we have 17 thousand Czechs.
However, Macrona doesn't blame anyone for threatening democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won the election mostly, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making some dramatic changes.
The virtues for those who have a parliamentary majority are great, but it is enough to look at Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like that in the case of the U.N. movement.
We just need a team that will work in the government for people, not for their parties or resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree that only teachers, employees in culture and social services would increase.
Why have I been re-elected and added 21 percent to the GIBS members who are already taking 60 grand?
Would you like to be the prime minister?
The Prime Minister has to intervene when ministers behave inconveniently, messing with the government with travel offices, and for the state's money, they would like to business like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and the country in Africa.
The ministers in the government don't argue, they're supposed to say things out of it.
There's no room for a coalition break, a strong vote, and a chat room, there's a decision to make.
How do you want to have a coherent team when the ministers are dealing mainly with the site?
There's a constitutional law over there.
When the bread was baked, Sobotka said the coalition contract was not paid, and he expelled Babies from the government.
That's what any prime minister can do.
However, if he is a person and has management skills, a similar gesture plan is not needed.
They measure all the same and require perfect performance from all.
Do you know who you'd suggest to the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it, because we're not even in that government, nobody wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I did so awfully.
That's not the kind of creature that's in place.
The senior entrepreneurs of the Pope, who would like to cooperate with you, may win over the wing of your benign Jiří Chunka.
I don't think so.
ČSSD leads Lubomír Zaorálek, which does not exclude the U.N. Coalition, the ODS may include Václav Klaus ml., which is not against.
I'd leave it on the electorate.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said you have many points in common with SPD Tommy Okamura, for example in the area of the economy.
So the ochamourists are considered a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec claims he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, running as a VV Vita Barty ball, then getting money from the Uzvita for his company, he ran out there.
Of course, he's a remarkable personality.
Of course, she's a little nervous.
When I take his program, there is a broad involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, that can be agreed upon.
I'm not asking you at all.
I wonder if you are an acceptable person who has xenophobic opinions spoken on demonstrations with matches and wants to leave the EU?
We don't consider working with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine.
It's obvious he went into politics to profit from it.
And what about the silent support of the communists of your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but I'm gonna have a voter.
It'll be about negotiating a winner with another in line, but God knows who's gonna be a winner and who's the two.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on a coalition government programme.
Let's go back to your attempt to be a firm.
But the government just has to drive, Prime Minister Sobotka has let everything go, never decided.
Coalitions such as ČEB or EGAP did not work.
For Sobotka is his ball, and I think that's also why he threw me out.
Once he did, Chez ruled the Czech government.
It is incredible, however, that the Prime Minister has brought a resolution written by the management of the CEZ, which holds to the Minister of Finance how he should vote on the CEZ Vale.
If you become a prime minister, will you change personal circumstances in the Supervisory Board and exchange top management ČEZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm a prime minister, he'll see.
I'm not yet him.
It's funny that the CEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with the ČSSD would like to exchange for even better with the UN.
Well, then, after the election, it'll all go on again.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have a humble lobbyist or a pinkie, I'm a single unit, and I don't even solve this.
Then answer directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you try to exchange the management of ČEZ, Czech TV or the General Health Insurance, that is, the institutions you criticise?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent company.
He's been doing what he wanted for years, and I've been providing for the traditional political parties.
It's enough to look into Mr Schwarzenberg's intentions.
Although he was supposed to be in the Czech majority, he never drove it, he was only there to count, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, assess them, put them into a subsidiary company, arrange funding, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her shows against me lead a permanent target campaign, but I don't and I won't have any jurisdiction to dismiss anyone.
But you can control it.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens are paying for public advertising and television fees of around 7.2 billion a year, but they don't really know how these institutions operate.
How come they don't know?
However, the House approves the report on their economy, which has a direct impact on the position of the Directors-General of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
Look how these reports are being discussed, the super powerful package of Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
It pays both for the current parliamentary commission to escape from the investigation papers, and for lex Babish.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kaluska push me out of the government, which saved the top 09 percent, but the ČSSD put them on.
They are afraid of breaking their corruption system, and so they are talking about the threat of Babish democracy.
Nobody's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the First Vice-President of the UN Jaroslav Faltýnek builds a power base by bringing up the son of the Supervisory Board of Tepláren Brno and setting up a joint lawyer of Kvetoslav Hlin's contract with city and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or the Czech Railways?
We're in a constant dispute.
I don't like it, and I've counted it several times.
The Faltínek argues that the lawyer in question works at a significantly lower rate and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As a finance minister, I didn't have anyone.
We, unlike the devils, never had a corrupt affair, no Pelt, no short-term, Brezina.
If there was any sign of clienteleism in our house, we just fired such a person.
I'm not compromised in this respect.
If something like this happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
