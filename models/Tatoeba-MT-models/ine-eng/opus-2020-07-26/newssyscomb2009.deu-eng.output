The triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, in total, is 29 percent
A significant weakening of the two parties of the former Great Coalition and a significant strengthening of the parties to the rule of law led to the first preliminary parliamentary elections from Sunday in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (OPVP) suffers losses, where the position of former President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the kipp.
On the contrary, the head of the alliance for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphal return to the federal policy.
According to the previous results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest power in the country with 29.8% of the votes, compared to the last elections in 2006, but it loses 5.5% of the votes.
Even worse, the GSP cut off, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the history of post-war Austria, and especially in the People's Party that demanded the elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the OVP had emerged from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead in front of the SPÖ.
The voters, however, probably punished the party for letting the government go wrong.
In the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible withdrawal of the Chairman and former Vice-Chairman Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case at an extraordinary meeting of the Management Board on Monday.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely exit from the electoral debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the large coalition from SPÖ and OVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) received 18 percent, the BZÖ received 11 percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fears at the same time that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party met with the populist talks (at that time the FPÖ was still unified, in 2005 it was separated from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which even led to sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with each party and to move from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal policy.
In Parliament, however, the Green Party was also in the process of bringing about a slight loss and, amongst the Austrian political parties, retired from third place to fifth place.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percentile and therefore did not join Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who have been accused in India because of the illegal collection of cages, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that it might be possible to cool down the Czech-India relations.
This was highlighted by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then be sure, it will come to some cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, in judicial matters the executives could only take a difficult step.
In spite of all this, he pointed out that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the prosecution and received a fine, the central government wants the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the case falls.
"His problem could be explained," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, Mukherdshi's view would be the best if he went to trial at a higher court.
He could ask for bail and wait freely for his verdict, as the Minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also spoken in negotiations.
"He recommends a call at a higher court, then a question for him comes up," said the chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to point out the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such help would already be offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he confirmed the importance of the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of his partner, the Czech Republic, to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he explained.
One answer to the question whether he received the Indian side's commitment to dealing with the matter is different from that of the Minister.
"I've already been promised quite a lot," he just noted.
A check points over the ring around the seabed
It comes to an electronic map, illustrated on Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-headed staff of the UN Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His chief, the Director of Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, pursues the interpretation and complements it.
Here are workers and enthusiasm.
The seabed has so far produced only a few known worlds that are rich in natural resources.
Here is oil to be found, then Erz and other non-adult raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which bear, for example, the key to developing a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
Today, the countries of origin have reported their claim to the new sea areas.
After a UN convention, they make use of their rights, to which they united themselves in Montego Bay in Jamaica in 1982.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental peninsula, which often reaches up to a hundred kilometres from the shore of a country into the sea.
This country, in accordance with the Convention, has an exclusive claim to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simply expressed as a continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It exceeds the limits of the sea, often also the limits of two hundred sea miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be based on extensive scientific and technical documentation, which is based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three last-mentioned countries have had success," Mikulka added.
An international echo was recently the success of Australia, which as the first country was able to significantly expand its marine areas.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the seabed granted to the country last week by the Commission is approximately 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times the size of the State.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit that comes to them in the future from using the seabed will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also be gradually submitting their requests.
You can do this ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of ocean supply, which is referred to by the Convention as "the common heritage of humanity", begins.
Then no state has a special idea.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a gold miner country," he says with some overcrowding Director Mikulka and adds that "its individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech in Pacific
Part of the seabed is also now part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former East Block within the framework of the Interocean Metal Joint Organisation.
In 1991, it was granted the status of a so-called "rail-breaker investor" by the Convention, as was the case with the investors of a few smaller states.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the sea floor.
"You can go there on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan", says another lawyer, the Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian staff of the Rober Sandev Division brings together such a particularity as a pattern.
It reminds of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the so-called scheme that the legend after the Golem has brought to life.
German special forces were on site when Geisel was released
The Egyptian government had asked for help to solve the Geisel crisis from Germany - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come to use.
More and more details are being made known about the circumstances of the release of eleven in Egypt by European tourists.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also directly involved in the rescue operation.
At the same time, both federal defence specialists and GSG 9 officials were the Flying Staff of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Chamber, and logistics experts of the Technical Service at the place of release.
However, as spokesmen of the ministries continued on Monday night, the German forces were not needed because the hostages left their prisoners and fled when they had recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian Government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve them as support forces on the ground.
"I'm glad it didn't come to this," said one speaker of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had expelled the group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and eight Egyptian companions in southern Egypt on September 19.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad were dragged into and out.
The identity of the hostages has not been as clear as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The gears have now arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the free hostages were in the grip of the German message.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin there was no information at first when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Image" section, the five holidayers and the special forces are to be evacuated with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US Representative's House Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the US Congress has left the 700 billion-dollar heavy bailout for the financial markets very little to lose.
The Dow Jones went deep.
With 206 to 227 votes, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of the two parties, there was no majority for the programme that should put chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the advocates had desperately tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion-dollar heavy package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called the MPs for an agreement, even though the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he said.
Still during the vote, the Dow Jones broke in by more than six percent or by 600 points.
There were reasons for concern on the part of the investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote in order to re-evaluate after the failure.
Experts now rely on the international financial markets with further heavy turbulence.
For the programme to enter into force, the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary.
Organizers list increasing bookings
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales in comparison to the previous year have increased significantly, according to a study - even for the winter season by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic outlooks, the journey of the Germans remains untapped according to a study.
In the winter season bookings, the travel offices recorded a sales surplus of 31 per cent over the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study by the GfK Institute of Market Research, the number of bookings already increased for the autumn months is also available.
So the sales plus of the travel offices for October amounted to about eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
The basis for these results is GfK figures, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel offices and accounts for the entire market.
This includes the travel bookings made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the low dollar rate, particularly travel to the United States was requested, the DRV reported.
This is about a third of the booking growth.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic fields of the Germans, were particularly requested destinations.
In particular, holiday trips are high in the course, DrV President Klaus Laepple explained.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, here the costs "are better calculated for customers than for the individual organised holiday".
Consumers could save money through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, said Laepple.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that the previous year would be a sales plus again - although according to another study the number of Germans who took a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first holiday October
Ballermann-Apres-Ski hits in the finish line, beer from litres and promises in Designer-Dirndln.
A Wiesn-debüt.
Susanne Kronsucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, television moderator and wears a tailor-made dinghy.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: almost three minutes on the lawn, the photographers are already crashing on us and cutting the memory cards completely - very funny and that on my first visit.
That's how you make friends.
The Billigi-Dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually located in the north of the White Wheat Square, the feeling of well-being remained in the suit so far in borders.
But just once on the Aresian Way, it's all half so bad.
Almost everyone wears an ashtray or leather pants; no eye directed or painfully touched - everything is completely normal.
Rare look at the chocolate stand only collects my dinghy shorts.
A nun reminds me that I would have wrongly tied the shorts: "Links hoast free, mid-wife, forgive right, reverse white."
Secretly, I'm holding back the loops from the back to the left.
"Exactly," he said and laughed.
Others make less effort to wear subtle flirting techniques and wear light filter gloves on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and stretch an unsolicited opposite the naked back.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, who comes from England and also visits the October party for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long drawn "oooo".
He tells me this after he has taken his first drink.
Right next to one of these hydrants, everyone thinks he's a muzzler.
So Bob's one of those notorious "Wildbeisler."
Others do not have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, health professionals in Schare run over the parking lot that needs to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the wheelchair - every four at once drag a covered load of tent to tent.
It works like with most Wiesn visitors: empty away, completely back.
Whoever's in the Promille Sarg is under the plan, you don't see it.
"These are the ones that pack goarnimmers," one of the sanitizers called me on request and disappeared in the crowd.
Name of the victim of an accident reported by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in a hospital after being attacked by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, resident in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at the Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the suspicion of light driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, the European authorities were interested in getting deep into Turkey's background.
On the east side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this corrupt, imperial effort.
The Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo Renaissance style.
That's at least what the tour guide tells you.
The building sits uprightly at the end of the train path with a tower on each corner of the front and thus looks like any provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart.
But once you are inside the waved ticket switch, there is no doubt about the propriety of the project, whose most western access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolian-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany's imperialist plans took place during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence by Arabs and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces expelled from Egypt and forced the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha Train Station.
In 1917, a munitions train flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was a Saturday.
Since then it has slowly collapsed, largely passed through history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and all east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Tukei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a huge new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
A policy of approach now prevails.
Significantly, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian split groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the facts of this new foreign policy, I have made the night trip to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a helpful ride on tracks that produced the same pace of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which will be seen as a new city, for the new world state project, the Ottoman past to return to its back.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamic origins, represents a paradigm change in the Turkish unity
This has triggered some mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi brought me to the AKP headquarters, a specially constructed, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-finished shopping centers and bars in which middle managers, both men and women, met to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-law politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Pull, Krawatt, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey was cut off from its back country.
Today, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There wasn't either one or the other.
She had to do both.
"But surely Turkey could at some time," I asked, "must be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to make this decision."
He then raised a point that almost everyone I spoke to here said almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey aboard, the message seems to be, in the transferred sense, Europe as a whole can run towards Asia and the Middle East as a whole on similar railways.
Back at Hydarpashas Train Station, after another night of largely sleepless sleep, I thought of these two German lords Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had seen this construction 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, lie in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting for the ferry station to bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At the time, at least there seemed to be little doubt about the continent that should have a claim on this fascinating country.
Remember Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, next year.
He was thought of young people up to 21 years of age, but when the choir was the last time in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 years - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape changer) was intended to attack the readiness and ability of the choir, any music that was presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young Chores was often amazing, always exciting and stood alone thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never left.
How often death kept us "to let the music speak for itself".
He kept saying, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So it's singing!"
His kind of leadership was absolutely clear and precise, but never did it take too long.
However high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any leader was to be beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, where he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I have written criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I was never disappointed by one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He dismissed the conductors who, according to his words, simply went home with one or two well-known sheepmen in the world.
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your reference to William Woodruff (September 25th), you write that "in 1946 he resumed the teaching of economic history in Oxford and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950 ... while studying at the same time for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from an author's comment in Woodruff's book "Jinside of Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University and during this time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published as the "British rubber industry" in 1958.
He was in the United States from 1950 to 1951 in the course of a Hoblon Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to miss this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological Faculty.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flemenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me pay attention to them because of their flexibility and because of the power they emit, how they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magic moments.'
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda begins marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large inner space, this large space limousine offers an even greater size.
This includes the technical features that make it possible to save even more comfortable driving and fuel.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
So is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically, the new jazz shows a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made to this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be highlighted.
However, before you begin to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz will appear six years later, after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda was able to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz in Europe is less known, this model is a phenomenon that concerns its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where Jazz is the most sold car in 2002 and also in 2008.
After Jazz was published on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 Jasz models in 2007, the expected estimates run on 10,000 cars. This is 17% of the expected growth on the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda has sold 8,000 jazz models, which are 6.7% of the total sales to Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the managers of the branches in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 Jazz models per year.
More precisely, it allows the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model to obscure the sales ban in Spain.
In fact, the brand leaders hope to complete the year with total sales of 22,000 models. These are 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this growth in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain from the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda puts on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters long, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the rest is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of insight on the market is foreseen for the first month of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it is 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous jazz model.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a double load system, also reaches up to 339 litres, which is 19 litres larger than the capacity of the first generation.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine because the capacity of the Honda Jazz trunk with a 1.2 litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except for additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility of introducing panoramic windows, improved access to the seats will be offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors was 80 degrees, with the first Jazz only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 performances of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance, while at the same time providing torque-intensive performance for the entire engine life.
The first variant with 1.2 litres achieves the performance of 90 PS in 6 000 spins with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and a CO2 output of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 PS at the previous generation, it is now able to reach 100 PS.
The jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litre of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-Bine' avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan this time was inspired by nature, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the copper behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the technical development centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed these small robots in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director of Technology-PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan security shield.
This robot is supposed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds up its own, oval-shaped flygraum, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the faces of the bees, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows them to fly uninterruptedly in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to imitate the Rundu perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles that are located in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and are located in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a bordered microprocessor, which is immediately translated into a signal to avoid collision
In the moment when the obstacle is observed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angle to avoid collision.
The greatest difference to any other system is that this exchange manoeuvre is absolutely instinctive.
If it were not so, then the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can neither go up nor down, but can not cross; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way that it does the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions to avoid collisions by the small robot.
`This device requires only a few seconds to process the information and act on these data.
It does not require the information or intuitive logic of the maneuvers made, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in developing the technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan will introduce in the next ten years to the serial cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and hold longer than the diversity of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through Satellite to avoid obstacles on the way to the goal when driving.
She's in the middle before she's loaded with a mortgage.
It must be noted that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without its own good.
Before the crisis and in order to prevent US citizens from developing mortgage stories of allegedly eligible banks, an entertaining and informative game for Internet surfers was developed: `Bad Credit Hotel', it means.
Or maybe the 'Hotel of Bad Credits' or of each other.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to consider one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask no credit.
And above all, where you can do it, which is also likely the goal of the game.
She certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is a page for teenagers rather than a place for all viewers.
What happens when the game is extended?
Well, if a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a renewal that is due to a strong case of its stock exchange.
A week after a provisional agreement was made public, the two banks explained that MUFG 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock shares will be purchased at a single price of 25.25 dollars, which represents a total amount of three billion dollars.
The accepted price is below 19% of the price of the share of 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares that will secure a 10% profit and can be sold again at a $31.25 price.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business would be carried out on the basis of a single average price of 29 dollars, which is 28% above the current price.
However, Morgan Stanley's share fell against 17.00 GMT by 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank," explained John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley has adopted this status last week, which will allow him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Its connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: last Monday Morgan had just stated that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
'One week ago', in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, managing director of the MUFG, 'we thought that the participation would be entirely made up of tribal property.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and ensure ourselves.
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will pay off about 20% per share with a reduction in profit.
The agreement provides that in one year the MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into stock shares if the latter are exchanged within a given period of more than 50% above the sales value, i.e. about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his sales.
However, a press speaker in the group refused to make more precise information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that his balance sheet had been down since the end of August `clear'.
The last few weeks were hard for the group, who had to take a look at how their stock exchange rate went down by half, while the price for insurance against payment incapacity was high.
This price went back on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivor' of the large investment banks on the Wall Street after the competition of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merril Lynch, announced to have withdrawn 15 billion dollars last week, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Re-establishing the Republic around the 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, of the Bolivian Evo Morales and of the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Jener third it was that this Sunday, following the example of his peers and friends, put the plan of a new constitution to the vote.
Mission meets, because according to the public results of 80% of the vote, 64% of the vote voted with 'yes'.
According to these results 28% agreed with 'No', 7% of the electoral lists were invalid and 0.7% were given empty.
In order to adopt the draft constitution, a vote must be reached more than half of all the votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the end of the Vahlokale and a census of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for 'yes', and 63% to 70% of the prophecy.
On the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa requested the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly', he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers south-west of Quito, and congratulated the Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election held in silence under the observation of the Organization of the American States (OAS) referred to a text consisting of 444 points in order to secure the 'new socialism' for which the President is employed.
The draft constitution transfers State violence to the economy by leaving it alone the right to "development planning" in a country that lives largely from the promotion of oil by foreign companies and from the foreign currency sent to the country.
The project, which will be preceded by the 2006 Correa selected, will also be given more extensive power to the head of state, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of every four years, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and that a new mandate will be sought in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in that country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also intends to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, which will provide an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an equatorial support point as a starting point for American anti-drug interventions.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command began the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were captured in the desert for 11 days were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon healthy and unharmed.
In the morning they were released from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, at 3.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft, the hostages reached the military base al-Maza directly next to the international airport of Cairo.
They were brought directly, without being able to speak with the press, on board a helicopter to the Maadi Hospital, a foreign district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoyed all the 'best health' and the kidnappers 'was not paid a ransom', Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna explained on the roll.
After being arrested on September 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border region of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was again brought from 35 unknown exiles from a hiding place.
It is eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency of Egypt, the organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from the board of two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
`On both sides fell shots and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,’ said this responsible, who wanted to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units were sent to Sudan, where they received support through German and Italian commands.
The chief of Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he is, about the role played by the secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men from the secret service and from the special units," he explained without further details.
He also argues that a ransom has been paid.
At night, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped a field vehicle on a patrol where the kidnappers were found, six of whom, including the leaders from the shadow, killed and two prisoners.
The army stated that they were associated with a rebel group from Darfur, the Liberian-Sudan-Unité movement (SLA-U), which was immediately opposed to this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and is the central theme of the current election struggle.
That's better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who is going to stand up and collect the miserable sums that are given to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are complainingly starving?
Which politicians will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects their monuments and their culturally important buildings?
That there are no laws in Quebec, as in Canada, that protect our cultural heritage effectively?
Did you know that the French government provides EUR 3.5 million alone for the restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
Our neighbours in the United States have written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, Members and all government districts, in mutual consent.
In Quebec, in the association of the historical societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 dignitaries gathered in 211 historical societies are trying to deal intensively with history, with a few grotesques to save the numerous private archives, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, who protest with the power of despair when supporters and decision makers leave their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten free holes.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux government government parts of the Fortis Bank
With a partial settlement, the Benelux States want to take over the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which is affected by the US financial crisis in Turbulence: the three countries provide the Bank and Insurance Institute, which, by the way, also has facilities in Hungary, a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level at the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s competition authority.
In the Eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has continued for a year, so decisions that are now taken in connection with the Bank could have a pre-emptive character.
In the sense of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three countries purchase the Bank's respective shares by about 49 percent.
The Bank will probably sell part of its holdings, all of the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis have started a steep course last week, and in the second half of the week, serious crisis scenarios have already emerged.
However, analysts agree that the bank is too large for a job with its 85,000 employees.
The Institute's securities fell to a 14-year-old depth on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock exchange rate, the market value of the group amounts to EUR 14 billion, which, according to management, is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion expensive American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty on the markets was due to the cash flow of the Fortis shares.
However, the courses have increased slightly on Monday.
On Friday, Philip Dierckx was appointed the new Director General of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but there was no interest in a business offer.
The Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor should spend his money, it said.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the branch offices of the bank have not been shaken.
In Hungary, the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls its own leasing companies.
Fuchs in henstalt
Because of human drug consumption, in America, life and health insurance often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market may become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in an independent hand, otherwise we trust the Füch the Hühner" - says Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance shall determine the fees and payments in the event of damage, depending on the health condition of the customer, and should be considered too high, the insurance shall not be closed at all.
Previously, the customer was sent to a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the light of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago Dick found a much cheaper method: according to the customer's identification number, he refers to the data of the last one and a half years of the pharmacies, the language which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates the patient's illness and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol lower medicines, it was followed by that his blood fat level is untreated, which would automatically select him as a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurance has to do more than just the paper frame, however there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as for migration and warming, but also for depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the point of view of the insurers, while the latter are not mentioned.
For data collection and processing, own societies have formed which, before they relate to the data, ask patients for their consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, even though there have been no omissions so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory investigations and link them with the data on drug consumption. In order to provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
While there is a personal data protection law for health data, its effect extends only to health service providers and insurance.
The draft law has already been submitted to the Congress, which could also be controlled by the authorities by the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be transmitted with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly prevent access to his data, since the insurance does not yet enter into a contract with him.
And so the hens are left in some way to the grace of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India to double trade
Since the European Union and India are both leading trading partners of each other, this was the main issue in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Industrial Summit is also taking place, where it is mainly discussed on cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an ambitious, democratic power which should be given more votes and co-operation in international affairs, Member States have not yet agreed to support the permanent membership of the UN Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed at the 9th summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU President-in-Office of the Council, Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
In view of the fact that trade between 2000 and 2007 rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally incorporated into an agreement so that air traffic will be avowed in the future.
By 2009 India wanted to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union of the partners is one India, New Delhi is only in the ranks of nine EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, namely terrorism, which condemned both sides to the strongest, and the convening of a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides liable for the failure.
The EU stressed that it adheres to its energy and climate programme, which means that the emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, just as with the proposal, to conclude a kind of global compromise at the future climate summit and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 per cent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated and both support the convening of an international conference on the subject of the financial crisis.
The head of Government of India today visits the French capital, where he will sign an agreement at a bilateral meeting on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris we are looking forward to orders from French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement is to be concluded at 15 years' time.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publisher at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th fair, the most important international event for legal procurement.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair is expected for the current event of over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will be distributed over 171,790 square meters of the fair and over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the most honored of the event.
The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will be represented by the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm large exhibition room "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion figures, trends and perspectives will be discussed around the publishing industry in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books of foreign writers in the whole, but especially in the adult and youth sectors, is diminishing.
Discovered a year ago the billionaire Steve Fossett's small aircraft
Steve Fossett's small aircraft, which was discovered on 3 September 2007 on a flight over the desert of Nevada, was discovered.
The parts were found on a 3000 m high plateau, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, completely discovered the latest doubts during a press conference: "The plane was located, on which a body was sent. Now we have the assurance that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or near it.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Transport Safety (NTsb) informed that a team had been deployed for a few hours after the flight was sighted, which identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab that was lost on 3 September 2007, after Fosset in Yerington in Nevada was launched for a 3-hour flight.
Yesterday, too, in California, not far from the border to Nevada, some of the personal objects of Fossette were found by a couple near her home at the Mammoth Lakes.
This is two demonstrations with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett was given one month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history by a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he was able to cross the world ball in a two-week, single-air balloon.
Three years later he circled the world in a single flight without landing with a plane.
Among its several records is an altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andes, which, however, is with a co-pilot.
Glad, the advertising you don't expect
A suv, which falls through its original design and the special line direction, the smooth surface and its clear angle from the traditional schematics.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to boost the sector's new breath with this offroader.
Just because of its exceptional features, the idea of the Suv Glk will also become unconventional, which will be seen in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz from October 17.
Thus, the advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also take place in a new dress, that is, in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the car sector back in Italy.
A project with a peak effort to be carried out by Corso Como in different phases, which will take the central shopping miles of Milan, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near Corso Como to give the whole a special perspective: the new suv will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car appears to stand out from the poster on which it is drawn.
On this side, using the Eluminium8 technology of the new glk is illuminated in different moments in all its details in order to reassemble itself as a whole.
Without a doubt, the concern of Mercedes with this advertising is to introduce a new type of autoclame into this rather stereotype field.
But will it be possible to travel the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it's clear who the Italian Hooligans are.
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls for whom all Italy is ashamed now? They are part of the Ultras Italia group, which has been travelling behind the Italian national team for years and who, frankly, have not caused any serious problems until recently.
Never before did it come to clash with hostile fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The sponsors came from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia were included in Sofia.
They wear the tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: however, they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Your models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a conflict with a truly radical dream, that of Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fans were given 144 cards for the game: all were displayed on names and therefore easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among those traveling to Sofia, no one was in a running stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already pre-loaded in this regard, were also refused the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal waits for the Bulgarian police reports to start further steps: in this case, the Tifosi arrested or identified in the outbreaks can be counted with a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums across Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of copyists, who could follow these little more than 150.
"This fire must be issued immediately, and this does not give such behaviour the opportunity to justify it in any case" means from the Viminal.
Therefore, "eyes above all also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sport Guard), on Tuesday, gathers the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, that is to say, the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce shouts and the right arm raised during Mameli's Hymne? In Bulgaria this is no punishment..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed without joy), who has been the director of the observatory on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the President of the police of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
While it is true, Mazzilli says that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duke, but undoubtedly the conduct of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist – adds the No. 1 of the Observatory – crimes are committed in the country of their actions.
So far, this group has been in the mood, but now it has to be considered what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the peppers during the Hymne Mamelis: this is also not a punishment, but they allow me to miss the education...".
