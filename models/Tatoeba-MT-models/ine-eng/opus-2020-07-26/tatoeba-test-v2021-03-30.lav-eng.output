When the English speaker points out that the stranger he is speaking to does not understand anything he says, he repeats exactly the same, but louder, as this person would be a fool. At no point does he think that his choice of words could be difficult, or that his statement could be easily understood, and that he could say it more simply with other words. As a result, the person not only does not still understand what he is saying, but also becomes offended by the fact that he is considered a fool.
