The triumph of the right populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceived weakness of both the existing parties in the great coalition and this marked reinforcement of the right populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections in Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian popular party (ÖVP), in which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously vaccinating, has suffered particularly severe losses.
On the contrary, the EU's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Deputy Prime Minister of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the triumphal return in national politics.
According to the provisional results, the country's strongest party remains the Socio-Democratic (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, however, compared to the last elections in 2006 it loses 5.5%.
Even worse went to ÖVP, which loses almost 9% of the votes by 25.6%.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the Austrian history of the Postwar and above all the literally catastrophic results of the peoples, who have led to early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the populaces had a significant advantage in the preference to SPÖ.
But the voters obviously punished them because they made the government sink.
In the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignations of the party's president, Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that it could be already Monday during the extraordinary call of the party's leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path to the ever more likely way out of the election result, namely to the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties (BZÖ) and the 11% of the votes of BZÖ, the socio-democrats have at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999 when the populists agreed with the peoples to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 separated from the BZÖ) which was also the cause of sanctions by the European Union.
On this evolution he obviously plays Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to work with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party has also been able to enter Parliament, but it has slightly fallen, falling among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If the problem could not be solved with the Czech scientists who were accused of the illegal collection of the Scarabites in India, there would be some cooling of the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, according to the Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it were not to be resolved, then it was found that there would be some cooling," he noted after the meeting that took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that executive power can hardly enter into legal acts.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was charged and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with that local in Darjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," the Minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to a higher court.
Then he can ask for the release on bail and wait for the sentence in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that, his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommend the appeal to the Court of Majors then it will be possible to obtain grace," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can enter the façade is to give the convicted 'competent legal support', the Minister said.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being paid by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been committed with India for many years.
Indians admit it too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, in front of his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a deep mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister has avoided answering the question if he has obtained a promise to take care of the matter from the Indian side.
"I've got relatively many promises," he just said.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia is designed and adjacent marine zones.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with her the seabed adjacent.
The area is at the same time large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 UN Division workers on ocean and maritime rights issues.
His head, the Czech Deputy Director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his presentation and every time he adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metallic minerals and other mineral materials, but also living organisms that are unknown until now that they carry within themselves the key to discovering the medicine against cancer.
The largest ground floor on the farm
Coastal states have begun to interest the submarine.
According to the UN Convention, that is to say, the laws on which they entered into an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental platform, which often extends to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the state in question.
This is the exclusive right under the Convention to all resources of the continental platform.
"In a few words for continental platforms, that part of the seabed and its subfloor, which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is meant.
The so-called exclusive economic area extends beyond the territorial sea, often more than 200 nautical miles," explains Mikulka.
The country's request to the Commission for the definition of the size of the continental platform must be accompanied by a very broad technical and scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It's the result of a preparation for many years.
"One of our tasks is to seek legal and technical assistance from the Commission.
The Commission has so far dealt with 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three appointments were successful," Mikulka adds.
The recent success of Australia, which has significantly expanded its marine holdings, has recorded a global eco.
But also New Zealand has earned us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, about 1.6 square kilometers, so more or less six times the same state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will bear fruit in the future from the seabed, as promised, will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do this for ten years since "the Montego Bay Convention" was ratified.
Where the continental platform ends, the area of the bottom of the ocean that the convention has declared the common heritage of humanity begins."
No one's been in an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Navy Foundation is not Klondike," says exaggerating Director Mikulka, "by the fact that its individual parties are legally demarcated and their contractually established regime."
The Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
If it splits with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was acquired in 1991 under the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, the status of so-called "pioner investor".
He has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is fractured, it's a nearly submarine replica of Tatry.
"E" can be drawn on the total surface of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is rich in polymetallic alloys containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan explains.
A Macedonia division worker Rober Sandev brings with him a discovery to show it.
It looks like a little patata or with a little fantasy, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the wake of Golem.
German special units were present for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready but did not intervene.
In the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages seized, we are getting more and more detailed information.
On the rescue operation, as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, special German units participated.
In addition to the army specialists, the GSG9, the Avian Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution were present.
As the spokesperson for the ministers announced last night, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, left the hostages running.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as direct assistance in the place.
"We didn't come for luck," says a spokesperson from the interior ministry.
On September 19 in southern Egypt, attackers kidnapped a group of travellers: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end remains secret as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the liberators arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
The details of the release were not explained.
There was no information in Berlin for when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, 5 vacationers and special units should fly with an Airbus from military aircraft and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The first chamber of the American Congress just failed the 700 billion-dollar rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 votes to 227, the American House rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals made by US President George W. Bush and the political leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the programme, which would have to justify the chaos of the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, supporters have desperately tried to persuade critics from a heavy package of 700 billion dollars.
Barney Frank, one of the treaty leaders, has encouraged Members to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have recognition to avoid something, which has not yet arrived.
While the suffrage was under way, the Dow Jones was crushed by more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investor concerns was that the state rescue package could fail.
It was then resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the failure, it collapsed again.
Experts now expect other serious turbulence on the international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force it is necessary for it to have the well-being of both the House of Members and the Senate.
Producers record figures for increased bookings
It seems to be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to one study, the turnover on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year has increased clearly - for the winter season even more than 30%.
In spite of the weak conjunctivities, the desire to travel the Germans is still valid.
On bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a plus of the invoice of 31 % compared to the same period of the previous year , as the German Association for Tourism DRV reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK market research institute, there are increased booking quotas for the autumn months.
Therefore, the excess travel agencies for October compared with 2007 would be up to around 11%, the DRV reported.
Presumptuous for these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
They would also include travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the low dollar ratio, particularly the travels in the United States were required, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly requested travel destinations in the Germans to Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as to Germany.
Above all, all the trips included have a high score, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
Considering the increased costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be better calculated for customers than for an individually organised holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts for reservations made in advance or offered with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that, compared to the year before, there would have been again an excess of the invoice - even if according to a further study, the number of Germans who took a trip, compared to the previous year was dropped.
My first time at Octoberfest
Ballermann hits, bottled beer from a litre and vip in Dirndln.
A Wiesn debut
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, TV moderator and wears a Dirndl made of size.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, is common: just 3 minutes in Wiesn, the photos are already launched against us and take pictures until they fill up the memory of the photographic machines – very luxurious, and this at my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how friends make us.
The Dirndl from two money seems to achieve its purpose.
As a tourist of Wiesn and actually resident north of the equator of white sausages, the sense of well-being in the costume/dressing up to this day is still within the limits.
And instead of coming to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or the leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's blizzard collects strange views at the banana stand at the chocolate.
A monastery tells me that I would have raised the lever in the wrong way: "On the left you're free, in the center you're virgin, on the right you're engaged, behind the widow."
All of a sudden, I'm going to turn my back on the left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less loss of subtle flirt techniques and wear hats of fur hats, on which the cape covers "To drink to get dressed!" and turn the naked back against an uninvited one.
The boy with display tendencies is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the Octoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous," with an ooooo squirt.
This tells me, after he got rid of his bottle of beer from a litre drunk before.
Right next to one of these hydrants, of which everyone thinks it's a potato.
Bob is one of these "Wildbiesler" families.
Others don't have the luck of getting rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 o'clock in the evening walk in white on the square of the feast the healthy, who must take care of the poor benefies
Nurses make up white every time – every 4 times they wear a tent-covered dress in the tent.
This works as with most of the visitors of Wiesn: it goes empty, it returns full.
Those who lie under the telone in this bar at an alcoholic rate in the blood, you can't see.
"Des sund die, wos goarnimmer packn", one of the sanitaries screams at me and disappears in the baraonda.
Victim of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being invested by a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident on Friday afternoon on the Shenfield Road in town.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, to Romford, but she died shortly after.
After the incident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with the abuse of leadership.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, European powers were anxious to enter deep into Turkey.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, there is one of the most beautiful relics of this fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Rinascimental style.
This is at least what tourist guides tell you.
The building is on horseback between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The entire building is slightly decadent.
But once inside the office ticket from the ceiling, there is no doubt about the size of the company of what was the most westerly passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway running to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions sank during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the ice-cold borders of the cold war, has passed
British and dominant forces marched out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there were bad news for Hyderpasha station too.
In 1917 a ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then it has slowly gone into dissatisfaction, far beyond history.
But today, this railway break for Anatolia and all the east points, they serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's growing diplomatic horizons.
The ruling party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the ice-cold borders of the cold war, has passed.
Now there's a new policy of commitment.
Significantly, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the Turkish capital Ankara carriage to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The following morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a race to subballs along the tracks that produced the old world chains of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to return its back to its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary move in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, more significantly in Washington.
A taxi brings me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by commercial centers built by means and power pastries, where managers in complete business - both men and women - meet to make first-morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a policy of the right-wing centre from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The cold war was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey has been cut off from its entrance.
Today you have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of one or the other.
They must be both.
"But certainly at a certain point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want to face that choice."
He then stressed a point that almost all those with whom I spoke have read in memory: the links between the Middle East and the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as far as Turkey is concerned.
With Turkey aboard, the message seems to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically travel those railway lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that Europe's Middle-East ambitions can now be largely in the hands of Turkey.
And while I look forward to the ferry terminal that leads me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
At the same time, there seemed to be no doubt that the continent should advance claims on this fascinating country.
Quick remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, 11 September) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under 21/, but at the time the Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to cope with all that music had to do, whether it was madgali or Messiah, without accompanying or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and was all due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often he was told by Tod of "lascair that it is the music to speak for himself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
There's everything in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the tray was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial or flowering.
Whatever the music standard was, it made it ever higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a director of the orchestra, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades when he was driving Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
During the past 40 years and more, I have discussed over 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been in agreement with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated the orchestra leaders who, in his words, simply "were riding around the world one or two well-known battle horses".
He's gonna miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your neurology by William Woodruff (September 25th) specifies that "in 1946 he began to study economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a degree in science, letter and PhD".
This results from the note by Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the United States as a researcher in Hoblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"Recommending the exhibition by José Vicente Resino "Flemenco y Life", because his photographs in white and black, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They drew my attention to the simplicity and strength they convey, although treating the protagonists with particular respect.
A sample that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second assault on the Honda supermarkets
In November the Honda will launch the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model had already had a large habitat, this new monovolume has an even wider internal space.
A refined mechanic must be added to everything, which increases the comfort of the driver and enables fuel saving.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a very similar line to that of the previous model, changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, it is worth pointing out an innovative design, a new platform, larger sizes and new mechanics.
However, it is useful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after the first generation market entry.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other producers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in sales.
This is precisely Japan's case, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, almost one million Jazz units have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow to increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, the estimates for 2009 were around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, corresponding to 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
With regard to the new generation, the managers of the Spanish branch are expected to sell around 2,000 Jazz units in the course of one year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the decrease in sales in Spain by a good measure.
In fact, the company's managers are expected to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, i.e. 4,000 in less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To succeed, the Honda trusts in the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a hybrid with five doors and compact format - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year around the world.
For the markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of the sales of Insight will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the presentation in society in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length is 3.90 metres (five cm in length), the width is 1.69 meters (two cm in length) and the interface is 2.50 meters, with an increase of five cm.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the living interior is also expanded.
This advantage derives from the introduction of a new platform, and from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the luggage – equipped with double background – is 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the engine version 1.4 and that the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 baggage is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear lights or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in the accessibility of the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, start with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees from the first Jazz.
Also, engines in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with a petrol engine of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both machines include i-VTEC technology that allows lowering consumption, producing less carbon dioxide emissions, optimizing mechanics, while maintaining the engine pair high in all its phases.
The 1.2 litre model allows you to use a power of 90 cv to 6,000 spins with a maximum couple of 114 Nm to 4,900 spins.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses – uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of approximately 125 grams.
With regard to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, they are now available 100.
The Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses reach a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "car monkey" to avoid collisions
In the context of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that, taking for example the flight of bees, can avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers at the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Two, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Brand Management, BR23C is an extension of the Nissan Four Area Security Shield.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the home’s vehicles.
During the flight, each water creates its own personal oval-shaped space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the eyes of the bees, which are able to see in all directions with a angle above 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, engineers have developed what they have defined a laser location (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor that immediately prevents the collision.
"At the moment when it detects a obstacle, the small robot imitates the movements of a monkey and immediately changes direction by turning on the right or higher angle wheels to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and engineer the head of this project.
Unlike an ape, the robot cannot turn upward or downward, nor in a diagonal; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can rotate and without using infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to compile the information every few seconds, and to act from this data.
It does not require the memory of information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruptions and with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, nor mega."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan expects to be serious in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the type with lithium ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to a destination by avoiding the obstacles present in the path.
Trema before you ask for a loan
We must recognize that the United States Treasury Department, as well as having many capitals to intervene, is certainly not ingenious.
Faced with the crisis and in order to prevent Americans from getting involved with money laundering in banks with doubt of insolvency, they created a fun and educational game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the Hotel of Bad Credits... or problems.
The tetra look of this accommodation and, in particular, its receptionist serves to make you think not one, but two or even three times before you ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary objective.
Certainly the information the game provides is useful, but it is not detailed.
It's more a page for teenagers than a website for the general public.
What happens if the game is complete?
Well, compare a dream room inside the hotel.
It's always something, though, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a share equal to 21% of its participation in the Company, resulting in a net decrease in its shares in Borsa.
A week after the conclusion of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that the MUFG would have purchased 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shareholdings at an individual cost of $25.25, which is an amount equal to $3 billion.
The price set is less than 19% than the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of securities convertible at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a 10% return on them.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global operation would be based on an average price of $29 per capita, i.e. a percentage lower than its current rate of 28%.
About 5 p.m., however, Morgan Stanley went down from $6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding company," explained John Mack, director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley has adopted this new statute last week, which should allow them to differentiate their actions by making it subject to the Federal Reserve control.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than the previous one.
The terms defined on Monday also show that in the last days the agreement has been amended: on Monday last, Morgan simply announced the sale of 20% of his shares to the Japanese Colosseum for a sum equal to $8.5 billion.
"One week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of the MUFG, explained: "We thought our share of participation would be exclusively made up of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation in the world economy and in the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, the MUFG will receive Morgan Stanley's securities at a price lower than their accounting value of 7%.
And the operation would translate into an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis."
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in one year if, during a given period, the latter were exchanged more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, i.e. about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow them to take investment opportunities, strengthen their budget and increase their liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group, however, refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore set a Tier One solvency coefficient of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that he had "clearly" eased his budget from the end of August.
In recent weeks, the group has tried hard to reduce the value of its actions, while the cost of insurance against risks has been reduced.
The cost that flowed on Monday, however, remained at a high level, about 12%.
Last week the Goldman Sachs, the only other "substitute" among Wall Street's big investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers' collapse and Merrill Lynch's discovery, announced that he had taken $15 billion, in part at the Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Found the republic on a socialism right in the twenty-first century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales et of the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, the latter was voting on the draft of a new Constitution.
A mission that has been carried out since 64% of the electors voted on the referendum, on the basis of votes equal to 80%.
According to these results, "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% white cards.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should obtain half the votes, one more.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the end of the election and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a striking victory of "yes", between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed proudly", he assured himself, congratulating the Ecuadorians in the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers south-west of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The poll, which took place in all calm according to the election observation mission of the Organization of the American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 acts to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution confers the power of the state on the economy, reserveing it the "planning of development" of a country which essentially lives on the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
Designed by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also accords more power to the head of state, which can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, which will have the opportunity to disband the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to reproposal its application for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also states that the health and education services are free, which the President has begun to promote in this country by 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will terminate the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 ports released in Ciad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian accompanying prisoners in the desert for ten days were brought to Egypt's capital on Monday afternoon, healthy and safe.
In the morning, they were released from an Egyptian command in Ciad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, about 15 and 30, on board a special aircraft.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to give any interviews to the press, to the Maadi Hospital, a residential area of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom "to kidnappers" has been paid," said Egyptian Minister Zoheir Garanna on the landing track.
During a 4x4 safari on 19 September at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages was swept away by a hiding place to 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Egypt, the organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night, just before dawn.
"There were the shootings, half the kidnappers were killed, while the others were running," said the manager who demanded to keep the anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lamp" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by the German and Italian commands.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We must admit that if we have achieved this result, it has been thanks to the professionality and efficiency of the men of our secret services, special forces," he said, without adding any further details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese Pattuli army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board of which the kidnappers were found and to have killed six, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and to have captured two.
According to the army, the kidnappers would be linked to an organization of Darfur rebels, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a statement immediately lied to by the latter.
Letter- The silent majority of culture
On the first page, a debate on the financing of culture on which the current electoral campaign is concentrated.
That's better.
But part of our cultural life remains in the shadows.
Who will speak to denounce the poor sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
What policy will the federal government be forced to reassess that is neglecting heritage monuments and buildings?
What in Quebec, like in Canada, do we not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three million and a half euros on the only restoration of the Chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
With our neighbours in the United States, it is the Constitution to affirm that the protection of the heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this by common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historic Societies of Quebec, at least 40 000 volunteers are grouped into 211 companies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archives and heritage assets, with four moneys, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are the ones who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-makers attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemetery.
When will the right space for history and heritage be reserved?
Benelux governments nationalize part of the Fortis bank
The states of Benelux, through partial nationalisation, assist the Belgian-Poland Fortis bank, which is in trouble for the first time in Europe for the crisis in the US credit market: the three nations will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interests in Hungary as well.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level at the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debated for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken on this matter can be a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will sell almost certainly part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of the Fortis had started with a vertical hook, serious signs of the institution's crisis had been presented then in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow them to go bankrupt.
The bank's shares fell almost 12% on Friday, the lowest point of 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Considering the current stock prices, the total capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to bank leaders, this value is not real.
The corporate summit is responsible for the collapse of the Fortis actions to the uncertainties of the extra-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
Monday, the title took off slowly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed a new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution has also looked for private buyers, but so far no one has made a proper offer.
The Belgian government had already assured the investors that they should not be afraid of losing money.
The bank's customers didn't panic, the subsidiaries weren't attacked.
In Hungary the Fortis has autonomous subsidiaries and has also purchased leasing companies.
The wolf in the pollen
In America, life and health insurers, based on medical procurement data, often refuse to provide an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a program of privacy according to which the use of prescription data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's like trusting the chicken to the wolf" - writes Washington Post quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of medicines.
Insurance companies are subject to the insurance rate and the resulting figure in case of accidents at the customer's health status and if they consider too high the risk they do not prescribe the insurance.
A long time ago, the customer had to undergo a medical visit and the contract was concluded only after the outcome of the exam.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the customer's identification code, you can easily get information from the medicines he has purchased in the last year and in the middle of the year, and from this, the equinox program of which diseases are suffering and in which health conditions are found.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in the blood is virtually insurmountably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
There are several versions of the program in trade, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer, besides the paper work, is not much left, even if there are small difficulties.
Among other things, some medicines can be used for more purposes, such as some compounds can be used against emicrania or heat vampires, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance - commercial point of view, is a risk increase factor, the first two are not.
For the request and processing of data, companies have been formed and these have, before receiving the necessary information from the pharmacists, requested the patient's approval.
The authorities are now obliged to do so even if they have not so far imposed fines for negligence.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to medical consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data and, at the same time, control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of the Congress, there is a bill that gives the authorities the power to control the companies specialized in the service.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough: that is why he has developed a programme that links the data further with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot deny the approval so much that otherwise the insurers do not provide for the contract.
So then at the end the hens are entrusted to the tenderness of the wolf.
Global Marquis Menu
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that trade mainly one another, the agenda of the ninth summit was dominated by this topic, in addition to all other global problems.
Today there will be a French-Indian summit that will focus primarily on cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises the fact that India is becoming a great democratic power to which more voice should be given in international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So he did not insist on this issue in the ninth summit organised yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission, and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found the agreement to double in 5 years, i.e. to increase up to 100 billion euros, trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods rose from 25 to 55 billion, this is not too ambitious.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements, so air traffic can also take the road in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The objective is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only 9th among the EU's partners.
The summit has devoted attention to global factors.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both parties, and called for a United Nations conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Round, although both parties played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed its persistence in the energy and climate programme, i.e. it would want to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need to establish a global pact at the climate conference scheduled for next year and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to slow down the increase in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India today will go to the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he prepares to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that in order to build Indian nuclear reactors, French companies will receive a 20 billion-euro commodity.
According to information from our printing agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian editors in Frankfurt
Large presence of Italian editors at the International Fair of the Book of Frankfurt.
Over three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Fair of the Book of Frankfurt awaits for this edition over 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand exhibition titles and with Turkey as guests of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary to the Ministry of the Goods and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government at the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be present institutionally with an Italian Point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
He will follow the press meeting at the Room Structure in the 5.0th floor of the Buchmesse: this will be an opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of the publishing industry in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign authors' books on total Italian production decreases gradually, in particular for adults and boys.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the billionaire disappeared a year ago
Steve Fossett's flight retreat, the billionaire disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying on the Nevada desert, was discovered.
The wrecks were found on a 3,000-metre hill in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, there were no human remains.
The sheriff of the Madeira County, John Anderson, fled the doubts that remained: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said in a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The billionaire, 63, was given for death in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) informed that a team of investigators was sent hours after the notice of the retreat, which then identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, scattered since 3 September 2007, when Fossett withdrew from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from Nevada, some personal effects of Fossett were found by a couple near their home of Mammoth Lakes.
It is two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash in cash and a envelope.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world's round on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later he made the world's round in flight and without a ladder.
Among his many records, he also flew 15 445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemas with an original design and well defined by decided lines, wide surfaces and clean angles.
This is, in summary, Glk's last born among the "compaties" of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to make a new window in this sector.
For its content out of traditional canons, it will be unexpected and unconventional also the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17 October.
So the advertising battage that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unpublished mode of communication even through an adventurous 3D affidavit campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A maxi-affisions project, organized in three different phases, will dominate the central way of the Milan shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como you will be able to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car is out of the manifest.
Then, through the use of the innovative Enlightenment8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, and then recombined in a single image.
No doubt Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something back into the stereotyped field of automotive communication.
Will this formula be able to stifle the interest of future buyers?
Here are the Italian hooligans
From the Trivenet, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of whom all of Italy is ashamed now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" which has been following the National Azzurra for years and which has not since created too many problems for the truth.
He's never met the enemy fans.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The promoters come from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These in Sofia have added groups (little units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-color flags where the cities of origin of the militants are composed: Saturday night they were removed to avoid being identified.
They're inspired by the English typhoria.
In Bulgaria they found a typhoeria of real Nazis, that of Levski.
Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all nominees, so easily controlled.
And the Viminal had control of them all: among those matches for Sofia, there was no one with a Daspo running, no one who had been stopped from attending a stadium.
Four Azurri fans, who had prior stage crimes, had in fact been denied the ticket and prevented the transfer.
Now the Viminale expects to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police and then take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorder.
An international Daspo that prevents not only Italian stadiums but all over Europe from attending.
Our hooligans, i.e., will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is fear-emulation: that is, to those little more than fifty, they add more.
"We must immediately fire this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they say from the Viminale.
So, "eyes well opened especially in view of the National Wednesday's game in Lecce".
In Puglia there is, in fact, a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow we meet the Observatory, Tuesday the Casms who can also count on a section of Asia, that is to say, the secret services, which deal exactly with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the arm stretched during Mameli's inn? In Bulgaria it is not committed..."
This thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) by Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Viminale Observatory (has taken the place that was before Francesco Tagliente and then by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly here in Trieste where there is a nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it has not been able to accommodate the Duke but, of course, the behavior of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I do not do the sociologist - he adds No.1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the event occurs.
So far this group has remained in line, we will now see what has happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But we're also talking about fish in Mameli's nest: even those that aren't done, but if you allow me, they're not education...".
