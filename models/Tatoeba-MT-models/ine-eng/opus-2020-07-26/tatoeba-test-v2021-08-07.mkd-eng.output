I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
I'm just with someone I want to be with.
I'm working in Boston now.
I'm working on it.
I'm at work tomorrow.
I'm working.
I'm worried about your health.
I'm afraid Tom will be mad.
I'm writing my conscience.

You can cross Hawaii for a whole year.

I owe Tom this.
I paid the penalty.
I'm planning to skip lunch.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I like dogs more than cats.
I prefer goat cheese from cow.
I'm guessing the eggs from the hippo.
I prefer the black one.
I'd rather sit down.
I'd like to walk alone first.
I must sound funny.
I promise I won't do anything to harm you.
I hit a box in his jaw.
I pushed the button to turn on the radio.
I've drawn the word "Alice" to highlight it.
I proposed it.
I put three coffees of fake sugar in your tea.
I opened my umbrella.
I've given up smoking abandoned.
I gave up.
I'm raising goods.
The Iranians were peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the way your hair looks.
I really like it.
I love your website very much.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mother's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It'd really be nice to shut up.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember how I met the queen.
I despise his harsh attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried one.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said maybe he'll come back.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is there something missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I saw him right now.
I've seen how to play cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister drop the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the mine.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom and Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is he far away from Boston?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Are you caloric compacts?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are they all busy?
Are they all happy?
Is everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
He's breathing?
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
I got right on my head.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I need to feel sorry for them.
I need to take her home.
I need to pack.
I should go change my clothes.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more cultural.
I should've checked.
I should have done that yesterday.
I should have known you were gonna be here.
I should have refused.
I showed my room.
Is it cold outside?
Is it over?
Is he far from here?
Is Dada really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I've got his hooker stuck in.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I'm sleeping on standby.
I slept like a curse.
I slept in the yard.
I slept on the bus.
I cut the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I'm smiling.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this great?
I kind of like it.
I've been cleaning snow all day.
Is she a cab driver?
Is she pregnant or is she just fat?
Is she really that pretty?
Is that your mother?
I was staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I hit something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Is there even that word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that Sarkam?
Is that enough?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Did you do that to them?
So there's Tom?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you came?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is it paid for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything special you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it a real diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this true in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is it your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this place free?
Was that all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or hiss?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom left.
Somehow I still don't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do it.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom aware?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom having fun?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Are you angry, Tom?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
You talk to Tom?
Is Tom there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying Tom's attention.
I burned a kibrite in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
I suddenly felt old.
I'm suffering from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on looking for a way out of this cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm begging you to settle down.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's the way I doubted it.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear to God, I wouldn't have caught up with you to burn and you would have been the last cup of water.
I follow each day.
Is your freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I use the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my counselors about what subjects to take.
That whole thing makes sense.
It looks pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So it wasn't.
It's not possible!
It's you for now.
It seemed much more than I expected.
Never, but never really, it couldn't happen here.
There's no way he was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
I didn't care.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That disappoints him.
It'd look good.
I don't mind.
It won't get any better.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; anyway, you have to.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like he knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I'm teaching Chinese.
I teach him English.
It's my fault.
That gave me an idea.
I've got something to do with it.
It had to be done.
It must have been created from somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too soon.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's cool.
It's not about luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has a sentimental value.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I think of him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm real.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'm going to go visit Tom and see what he's like.
I think I love you.
I think I've made myself clear.
I think I'm writing pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible for me to pee.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French very well.
I think it's risky without any help.
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it's time you left now.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I'm wrong.
I think I might be able to help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's crazy.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's inhaled.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom was brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's beautiful.
I think Tom's cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's evil.
I think Tom's fine.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's tiny.
I think Tom's a cepide.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's under threat.
I think Tom's being subtle.
I think Tom's sensitive.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom will go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better if we don't drink water.
We'd better not get out of this storm.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to the solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we ate enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should pick her.
I think you should do this alone.
I think you're helping me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should end up with this on your own.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought there were bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask for his help.
I thought I'd ask for their help.
I thought I lost all my money, but it seems I was wrong.
I never thought I'd find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought it was causing me.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom was retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was coming from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
So we didn't agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I was thinking about visiting the museum together.
I think you're gonna have a run for the goose.
So you didn't want the reward?
I thought you found another one.
I thought you lost your hand watch.
So you don't hate him?
I thought you were tired.
I thought you might be able to help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you were only dating girls who were inferior to you.
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
So didn't you say you know how to swim?
So you said you wanted to go with us?
I thought you were playing chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
It hurts so much here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the cup cap up.
It's a multi-phase process.
It depends whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
I can't answer the question.
There's no way I can finish my job in one day.
It's less wet than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I handle that?
I'm paying.
He's not coming to consider.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get in our head that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer than yesterday.
It's worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
He's writing on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It kind of seems wrong to me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It'll be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be worth it.
It looked terrible.
It looked funny.
Looks like you're right.
It looks very delicious.
It looks different.
It seems familiar to me.
It looks like eggs.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday.
Looks like these two are back in touch.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Looks like we're gonna have a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's what I got close to Tom.
You're scaring me.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It might have sounded like a proposal, but it was an order.
Maybe he'll come back tonight.
Maybe it's weird.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It might rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It must be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me that time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I can't.
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen years old.
I told you this would get boring.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I happened.
I'm back by bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants were taken off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I fully understand.
Probably won't be worth waiting for.
He was back two days ago.
He's been having a lot of trouble.
I tried to explain, but I didn't.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to make them stop.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
I'm sincerely sorry for that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to dry up.
He's getting ready to go back.
It's a classic.
It was a real disaster!
It is recommended that you check for adverse effects if you drink alcohol while drinking the medicine you have been prescribed.
It's a children's game.
It's a good system.
There's everything in the file.
It's all in the room.
We're done.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
It'll be over soon enough.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's almost got to go.
Epten's fun.
It's seven o'clock.
It's 11 o'clock.
It's already open.
That's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
That's a fake lead.
It's a risk plan.
It's a shame the concrete doesn't burn.
It's coming up fast.
It's just a job.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They've unplugged him.
You just got me a macky.
It's been a week, up and down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely hot.
It would be best if you didn't talk that much.
It's better to be alone.
Better to be optimistic and lie than to be pessimistic and right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's nobody here.
It's time to close.
He's cold in here.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
It's dark here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to end up in prison than to escape.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
I guess I misjudged him.
It looks like her style.
It seems to me that this is the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's evil to sow.
It's ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's Fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
She's dressed.
It's dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It'll be beastly.
It's gonna get cooler.
It'll happen soon.
I'm glad to see you all again.
That's good training.
It's okay.
It's improved.
It's very fun.
It happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's hot here in hell.
That should be possible.
It shouldn't take us a long time.
I don't care what you think of Tom.
It's impossible for him to quit smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in great shape.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's just a question.
It's just invented.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of skin.
I'm making up my mind, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to carry such gifts.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
It's not a great miracle.
It's not a great miracle.
It's loud in here.
It's none of your business!
It's not a secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not back.
That's not exactly how it happened.
It won't be easy to do that without much help.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's nothing scary.
It's not just a guess.
It's not usually a pen.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not that we're doing something.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not yet spring.
Don't surprise me.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It doesn't happen very often to buy a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a print error.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
It sounds pretty loud.
Sounds very good.
It's our job to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still there.
It's probably still available.
It's double.
It's actually very common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
It's possible Tom doesn't help us at all.
It's simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's a real damage.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's a law!
It's so obvious that we don't need any evidence.
It's getting dark.
There's still darkness out there.
It's still for sale.
It's still working.
It's still not working.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's strange how people in the tropical zones eat spicy food like cari.
It's stuck.
His surface was as flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best thing I've ever tasted.
It's a spider's casino.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them on their own.
He's hot.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
It's not going to take this heat.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom right away.
It's very relaxed.
It's very simple to understand.
It's hot here.
I don't think so.
There's a wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
The water only needs three minutes to shut down.
It's been a long night.
It took a lot more than I thought it would.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
It turns out you're an unexpected beauty saying.
I turned the fan on and turned it towards the wall.
I turned the lamp on.
I turned off the TV.
I turned him down, Tom.
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was midnight.
This was a wee day.
It was a great show.
That was all my idea.
It was all right here.
It was so easy.
That was an amazing night.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was my responsibility to spend the night with a smart, spiritual and beautiful girl like you.
That was an amazing experience.
That was a surprise.
That was a wonderful experience.
It was a hard test.
It was a warm night.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a great day.
It was a wonderful night.
Such conduct was childish on his part.
It was awful.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
It was fun yesterday.
He was having dinner.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It wasn't easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
The pain in dogs is proved to be higher than the pain in cats.
It was so great.
It was pretty funny.
Epten was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was breathing a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so nice that we decided to plan.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that's stuck in the locker.
It was Tom.
It was too little.
It was a shame.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was ridiculous.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very crowded in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was better.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It won't be okay.
It won't be enough.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
There's nothing going to cost you to fix it.
They won't help lies.
It won't help you.
That's good.
It would be very normal for you to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I can explain everything.
I need you urgently.
I've been watching you before.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I already wrote everything I needed to write.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
I've always had someone to help me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I burned the cake.
I burned their cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little overwhelmed with another.
I turned the whole city looking for Dom.
It was a lot worse for me.

It may be too late.
We're finally getting together, Tom.
We met in a maean.

I think you can tell us where to find him.
We tried to get them to come.
We tried to get them to tell us.
We tried to hide it.

Yoga comes from India.
You all look so busy.
You always forget.
You always get me wrong.
You always leave your point dirty.
You and I will fly the same plane.
You don't seem to know how it hurts to bite you alone.
You're doing great.
You're beautiful.
At the same time, you are difficult and easy, and pleasant and bitter; I can't live with or without you.
You're drunk!
You're my friends.
You're my luck.
You're my pride and joy.
You're not Japanese.
You're not a Canadian.
You're not invited.
You're not following.
You're one of us.
You're taller than a pawn.
You're under oath.
You're taking off.
He got there in front of them.
You asked me to help.
You cook bread in your ovens.
You beat her.
You're borrowing books.
You can ask me what you want.
You can ask yourself.
You can ask Tom.
You can avoid such problems if you have these wise advice.
She can be trusted.
You can hug me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never catch my mind.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
You can count on us.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
Now you must leave, sir.
You can leave and stay as you like.
You can get out of here.
You'll be able to do it.
You can handle this.
You can take mine.
You can recognize your children's voices without problems.
You can make things easier.
You can rest.
Now you can sit down.
You can stay in here.
You can only stay if you're quiet.
You can study here.
You can rest.
You can talk later.
You can't beat me.
You can't call them.
You can't control me, Tom.
You can't deny it.
You can't deny it.
You can't do what's gonna happen to you.
You can't fire her.
You can't fire him.
Now you can't help us.
You can't just leave the baby.
You can't leave Boston today.
You can't let that fit.
You can't marry Tom.
You can't prove anything.
You can't sell it.
You can't sit there.
You can't take that away from me.
You can't do this to me.
You can use my car.
You can use this car.
You can use this pen.
You're quick to get the data.
You're cookin' an ice-cream.
You might be wrong.
You could've refused.
You'd be a great mother.
You better ask them first.
To find them.
You better go help him.
You better go.
You better let me do that.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
You deserved better.
You would do the same for me.
You've done the wrong thing.
You've done your job well.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about it, right?
You already did that.
He did all he could.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't even want fish.
You're gonna get hurt, aren't you?
Don't you have a random key?
You don't know how long you've been here.
You don't have to be abnormal to work here.
You know my dick.
You don't know anything.
Dream you know.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
You don't have to be present for this.
You don't have to go.
You don't have to panic.
You don't have to wear anything dirty.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't understand business.
You don't want to do something that will remind them that you're actually not big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You don't work here.
You're driving me crazy.
You forgot your backpack!
You scared Tom.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
You have the right to a phone call.
You go get Tom and get back.
You hit one.
You're wrong, people.
You were right, guys.
Your hair's broken.
You hate us, don't you?
You have a great job.
They bite your conscience, don't they?
You have a habit I don't like.
You have little breasts.
You have beautiful lips.
You were a great mentor to me.
You were busy.
You have merciful eyes.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
I respect you.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
You didn't see that, did you?
You haven't solved the problem, have you?
You have a really good handwriting.
Your hands are soft.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a present.
You have to go home.
You have to help him.
You need to hurry to catch the last train.
You have to resign.
You have to inherit.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
You can't lose your condition.
You have to try, Tom.
You have very nice lips.
You've got a lot of eyelashes.
You heard exactly.
Just get back from vacation.
You almost missed him.
You almost missed Tom.
You don't get involved in this.
Children, stay here.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you do.
You know me better.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're learning fast.
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you're sick.
He left me in despair.
You let Tom escape.
You love your life, don't you?
You'll be all right.
You're going to be confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You'll be famous in time.
You'll feel better.
You'll take a copy.
You'll be better off.
You'll get them back.
You're gonna have a fight.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
You're going with me and a point!
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You're gonna have to study better next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.
You'll never find her.
They'll never take you to that club.
You'll never guess.
You'll never know.
You'll understand when it's time.
It looked beautiful.
You look familiar.
You look beautiful.
You look pretty bad.
You look very good.
What's wrong?
You look imaginary.
You look very handsome, Tom.
You made something.
You gave me a word.
You're distracting me.
Maybe you'll need it.
You can go anywhere.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be bad to slow down.
You met my sister, right?
Maybe you can help them.
You have to be careful.
You must be confused.
I'm sure it's very easy for you.
You must have jumped.
You must be very proud.
You must be strong.
You have to show up first.
You have to forgive me.
You have to help her.
You have to cheat on the kid.
You can't give up.
You've got to get through the trouble.
You have to learn valuable.
You need a friend.
You need a good woman.
You should buy some sugar.
You should do it somewhere else.
You need to make him listen.
You need to grow up and make some.
You need to help her.
I need you to help me find him.
You need to hurry.
You need to do this to work.
You don't have to ask why.
He didn't give them a chance.
We only have one life.
One is life.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth after each meal.
You should go to the dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You pay me very well.
You made a good choice.
You probably think I'm a traitor.
It's gone red.
He was running as fast as he could.
You're burning the car.
You're burning the car.
Your complaints upset me.
Your transgressions have defiled the graves of your forefathers.
Your demands are unreasonable.
Your desserts are tempting, but we're all quiet.
You're ready to cry.
You're absolutely right.
You're a real freezer.
You're acting weird.
You're crazy.
You're a fraud.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a loving man.
You're all cowards.
You're all the same.
You really do.
But she's a liar.
You really need a shrink.
You really should have let me call a cab.
You're always tired.
You're a moron.
You're nobody and nothing.
You're a pig.
You're a prisoner.
You're a racist.
You're a jerk.
You're smart.
You're a smart man.
You're a wise man.
You're mean.
You're busy, aren't you?
You're capable, but you're forgetting.
You were brave, weren't you?
You're mean.
You're unorganized.
You're mean and repulsive.
You're experienced.
You're right.
You're beautiful.
You're free.
You're gay.
You're gonna need help.
You're gonna need this.
You're doing fine with this.
You're in the middle of the night.
You're hurting me.
You're not laughing at me.
You're impressive.
Now you're in charge.
You're in power.
You're incapacitated.
You're powerful.
You took my place.
You're not in any danger.
You're interesting.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
You're something I'm weak.
You're lucky I didn't miss you.
You're lucky.
You're lying to me.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
You're great.
You're distracting Tom.
You're my neighbor.
You're not my friend.
You're not that young anymore.
You're not a freak.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You won't find me.
You won't find them.
You won't find us.
You're below her level.
You're below his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that horrible.
You don't suggest we give Tom all the money, do you?
You're not that old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
Now you can go.
You're crazy!
But you're smart.
You're our guests.
You don't have any alcohol anymore.
You've got too much work to do.
You're specific.
You're part of our team.
You're a pessimist.
You're poor.
You're predictable.
You're a narrow town.
You're quite safe.
You're really sweet.
You're right.
You're very lucky.
You're laughing.
You're funny.
You're uncultural.
You're upset!
I'm very attracted to you.
You're very dramatic.
You're very helpful.
You're very passionate.
How negative you are.
You're a little rude.
You're kind of rude.
How much do you think you're doing?
You're so talented.
You're stronger than Tom.
What a bug you are.
You're such a pig.
You need to help them.
You're scaring me.
You're terrible.
You're the only one who can smile at me.
You're the only one who ever met Tom.
You're the owner.
You're the prisoner.
You're the problem.
You're weak.
You've ruined your whole life.
You're too smart for that.
You're not reliable.
You're upset.
You're very smart.
You're very good with kids.
You're so lonely.
You're very direct.
You're very stubborn.
You're very cut off.
You can wait here.
You're among friends.
You're with Tom, right?
You misjudged her.
You're wrong, Tom.
You're lying, Tom.
The wires look weird to you.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You're too tight when you shake.
Why don't you go to a doctor?
Your house is very beautiful.
It's good to remember.
Your moon is coming back.
Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
Your path is hard.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
Your excuse's up and down right.
Your propaganda isn't interesting.
Your faith is bad.
Your role here is so important.
Your police are full of books.
There's yours.
Your sister's asleep.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
All your stuff is here.
Your wishes are my command.
Your patent's been unlocked.
That's what you said an hour ago.
You told me to call when it was.
You said we'd never catch her.
You said you'd help.
You said you'd write me a message at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
Apparently you already know the answer.
You look like he's studying you.
Looks like you've got an infection.
I guess it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You need to ask them for help.
You should ask Tom.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Be careful not to overdo it.
You should be happy for them.
You should be proud.
You should eat less red meat.
You need to eat more.
You should feel flattered.
You should sleep well.
You should give him some space.
You should give them some space.
You should go help him.
You should go to bed early.
You just need to talk to Tom.
You need to pay your rent in advance.
You only got 65.
You should try it.
You should try this.
You should try to write in a decent way.
You should've asked her first.
You should wear a helmet while you drive a motor.
You need to write a letter of thanks to Tom.
You smell like shit.
You sound like you're relieved.
You sound very safe.
You took off your ankle.
You're beautiful.
You're really talking a lot.
You talk too much about Boston.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
Traitor!
You two are very sweet together.
You used to be so fun.
You used to love Boston.
You're in the back.
They drank you.
You've had a ride, but you're gonna be okay.
You didn't praise us.
It was of great benefit to us.
You're right from the beginning.
You made white again!
You bought Mary something.
You beat me.
You beat them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.
He's overstepping it!
You have a rash.
You're heavy enough to worry.
You got me wrong.
I promise.
You got it now, don't you?
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
You let Tom down.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been delaying this for too long.
You saw what I could do.
You were amazing.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
He was lucky to have survived the attack.
You're wrong.
It's not that you were wrong.
He was right, Tom.
He was driving fast.
It was great.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
He was very brave.
You were wrong about the picture.
You'll do as I command you.
You'll find your toys and books.
You won't need that.
You're not gonna make it.
You won't win.
You're too thirsty for him.
You wouldn't want to be late.
Yeah, I'm mad.
