Parliament did not support the release of Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to cancel within the framework of the new paragraph of the criminal law, on the basis of which the leader of the opposition was convicted, Julia Tymoshenko.
The amendment, which would open the way for the release of the detainees, was rejected by the Members at second reading of the proposal for a reduction of penalties for economic offences.
Germany was sentenced to seven years in prison in October to enter into a allegedly unfavourable contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not valid, the appeal against the defendant shall be brought by the court in December.
The German states a judgment on the political debt of the regime, and the suspicion of the Court's inaction has also led to proceedings in the West.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 from the criminal law, on the basis of which the expert was convicted, supported the vote of 147 Members.
For his approval, 226 votes were required.
Libya’s Victory
The story of Libya's liberation, or Libya's rebel, has already been defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him is after war.
It's still defining the winner.
As is customary in the country, in the election of the winning Islamists, it's about whether calming or radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to the customary Sharia law and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because the hand is cut by theft.
Women can forget about emancipation, the possible waste from the faith is waiting for repair and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, the company consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we can't imagine and that we certainly don't want.
Only our way of life is not the only, not the most objective and probably not the Libyans mentioned for change.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic warriors were grateful to the faithless dogs.
The only thing I'm sorry is that from their point of view, some general of America did not fly from NATO, but Allah, whose size was celebrated in every given effort.
So if they're looking for winners in Libya, the West doesn't belong to them.
We took part in the shooters, we served Islam, and our politicians, in the dictator's person, got rid of the political alliance without guaranteeing any profit.
After fresh bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we don't buy the Libyan military.
The local fall is a problem with "crust" ejection.
But will they have no company of oil for the loss of Libyan black gold?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast an unfair protection of human rights.
So if that doesn't prevent us from making you know what's wrong with the Sharia law.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe went to search for investors
Statistical crime swept across Europe on Tuesday.
The individual States have published data on HDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy has been stagnantly stagnant, Germany and France are growing.
The debt market, but today it's trading records.
Investors don't only look at Italy anymore, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe have published preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
HDP Germany grew by the expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better off than expected (a growth of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), and France indicated that it was found in a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original data referred to as stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent per year in the third quarter of this year.
However, for a number of years, the gross domestic product (HDP) stagnated and, according to the ČSU, confirmed the trend of slowing economic performance growth.
The results are worse than analyst estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent over the third quarter of this year, but stagnantly.
The German economy increased by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter according to the preliminary and seasonally recalculated data.
The eurozone economy and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
Greece's economy has fallen by 5.2 per cent per year.
The value on her 10-year-old bonds is 28.45%.
The outputs of Italian and Spanish bonds are growing to critical limits.
Problems also start to feel Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium etc...
The Czech 10-year-old debt accounts remain below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
From Germany, it seems that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrates the 200 million process
The football performance was the hardest task of the season to handle!
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Czech and beautiful brown Petra Jiráčka won 1:0.
Czech football, even with a lot of luck in the second half of the year, has taken off the luxury drive from home and will not fail again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz was monitoring the progress in the detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a lot of luck in the second.
Czech representation and thanks to the home death in marriage, the great Czech and hero Jiráčov won in Montenegro happily 1:0 and celebrates the process of the European Championship.
Because of the precise defense of the Czech people, the Blackhorses got to the pressure until the second half.
The fighters of the battle became Damjanovic and the Vicinic, who burned two great odds.
Even thanks to the great Czech representation of Peter Czech, neither the Czech nor the next year will fail to win the European Championship, the prize of some 200 million crowns is added to the foreign football fund.
A lot of fighting football has been playing since the opening minutes.
Both teams were hard to get involved in the combination and played mostly around half a row.
The pressure of domestic footballers did not come at the first half, because the Czech defenses did not give up exactly.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred high school students have created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
They want to express their gesture of support for their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday morning, the students prayed before the object and then caused the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students of the University of Isfahan in Iran created a living shelter on Tuesday around Isfahan's nuclear technology centre, where uranium is processed.
They give so obvious that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) noted that Iran, according to all, did not cease to seek nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities is being talked about in Israel.
The students prayed in the afternoon before entering the Isphahan nuclear facility and then caused the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at protecting the Iranian nuclear programme as much as possible, the Israeli press would, in addition to the Isfahan Centre, also aim at the plant in Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Foodstuff of a pregnant child: not eating and eating a meal
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with overweight, with an excess weight of 9 percent of schoolchildren and dependents being 5 percent of children.
In most cases, elderly children come from a family with a health - care lifestyle, as shown by the current survey.
Again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the environment in which it grows and the patterns it surrounds.
For example, on tables in obese children, there are up to half the number of births more often than in families with normal weight.
The minced petals had no chance of having more than 19 percent of obese before the day of the study of the lighting action called Obeseita.
Also, in fattened families, it is not customary to sport, but most families of today’s schoolchildren - only 15 percent of the children responded that their parents would find time for active movement at least once a week.
Research among 900 children
The study was carried out at the end of last year’s school year and attended by 900 children from elementary schools from all over Czech Republic.
It was already the second anniversary of Obezita's action is not an accident that supports the General Health Insurance and Unilever company.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4 to 8 classes have been involved in the project.
Proper feeding and sufficient movement in the family is, however, one of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the respondents, for example, stated that it is five times daily in breakfast-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition," is one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and evening dinner
Experts point out that for healthy development there are important and relative details, including regular family breakfast time.
In the Czech Republic, at the same time, only 23 per cent of the families of the students are eating.
In most families, they eat each on their own.
And the worst thing was finding out that in ten households he didn't eat at all.
Breakfast, then, is the basis for the right daily food.
The questionnaire showed that there are more and more congestive foods in the families of obese children.
Almost every - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 per cent).
Although she regularly sports more than 40 percent of the children in question, their parents were less than half the result - 15 percent.
Get your lunch.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make up of the options offered by their own food according to their own taste and opinion.
"The feeding preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are from a healthy diet far away from ideal."
Among their favorite foods are a lot of wet, fatty and sweet foods.
"The alarm is, in particular, a large form of sweet lemonades," the final study report states.
For lunch as a main meal, the pasta won just over the poultry.
But children practically didn't want candy, and the shape of fish and southern vegetable foods is low.
Illness of health
At the same time, the research has shown that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In the review group of participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of Obezita's illustrative lecture, there was no coincidence in a number of cases a significant set of preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the results of the project are indicated.
For example, it was marked by sweet lemonades, where more children would begin to prefer ordinary water.
Also, children were more frequent in the poultry and fish questionnaire as the main food of the day and would limit sweet foods and nuts.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, hard-earned professionals.
In the opening article on how to teach stylists, I was so excited that it had been a lot in the opening hours.
I didn't know what was going to happen.
The lectures of three professionals from the field, the clothing of the problem figures and the seminar on how it works.
And it's gonna get worse.
The closer we get to the final test, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "duck."
This time we and Director Allenko were discussing how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly commensurate character.
And there's a vast majority of them.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's got a boy's face back without a proper curve, and someone's over-weighting.
The stylist must know how to optically change the broad shoulder, extend the neck or add the necessary curves.
We got tips like Jennifer Lopez's women, so bigger breasts and sides and tight belts, I'll highlight the character pretty much and at the same time don't dress a woman too challenging.
For example, if the difference between the belt and the sides is such that the skirts or pants are not really sitting, then it is worth listening to at least one such piece in peace.
You certainly won't regret it, because perfectly falling clothes are for non-payment.
In a dress at peace you will feel much better than in those who constantly change you, include you, stay in the walk, and so forth.
The male’s character may again be allowed to wear clothing with a shave, application, sweating or pickup.
Of course, this type of information is a lot, so I'm glad that I've been working all week to get all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid that in view of the homework assignment, it's up to you.
Each of the coursers has received an associated celebrity, which is intended to produce two outfits: day and night.
We need to take into account the current look, fashion style of the given personality and type of character.
I'm gonna "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the spirit of me, I am certainly better for myself than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently brought a hundred pounds (breath, please, under the cover), or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut the envelopes out of magazines or search the Internet and print and then process the graphics.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, will also express our personal style and relationship to the graphic creation.
Meditating on the graphic page of styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates so-called product pages in journals (on specific tasks, such as trendy cables, cables, etc.).
The designer and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But it's Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
On Saturday, three guests from the field were arrested for information on the types of posts.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a good-looking stylist can work with one piece of clothes differently.
In this case, variability is key.
So you have to wear such a trenchcoat (or if you want to original trenchcoat) you can wear classics over jeans and tricks like a coat, but you can also wear it on a naked body, round the boat and picture it as a dress.
Or just to pick up the gloves or the glue and immediately the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of all, I assessed the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work."
"Then you can start breaking them," said Jakub.
Finally, I can see why we are all concerned about what to combine with, what, why, when we see something else in fashion magazines too.
He won't even talk about surveillance.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know again that the stylist must have prepared a lot more outfits than he's going to take pictures.
So in fashion stories that will have ten sides (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be prepared to "stabilize" at least fifteen.
And it also looks and works in combination with other pieces of leckda completely different from actually.
So we have to count on that when making the outfit.
That the image and style make the leaks up to half the success, confirmed Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna, who's not exactly a wonderful singer, but the image and marketing made her the world's old.
In the Czech Republic, access to the use of stylistic services is still colder.
Even familiar faces consider her to be unnecessary (just because I know something, what I look like is a sort of thing).
And if someone is already letting us create styling, then we have to calculate that with a great probability he imposes a completely different size than he really does.
Then there's nothing left but to google and find out if the bulwark didn't say that the celebrity in question was broken/depressed and so on.
Honza and Mario put it in our hearts on Sunday that stylists don't have to be in fashion and know how to fix the outfit.
In his work he communicates primarily with the people he's wearing, and so it's important to be a good psychologist.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
"When you're ordered by a manager to order her a dresser and fill her up with nice pieces, you can't throw her out the whole box and say, oh, my God, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things you commend and recommend what they're allowed to wear," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what everything must contain the so-called "placow" or the bag on the spot.
It's the one you turn around the belt and you have all the necessary properties.
In addition to clear things like knives, hairdressing, or closing pins, there are also silon thread (with it the stylist helps with photos of products such as cables or hats), special clips that we can turn behind the clothes if they are larger (spend or other screws are not allowed, they would destroy clothes), or a shirt.
In order not only to listen but also to try something practical, we learned how to stick to the shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where there's a flat surface, it could damage the lawn, right outside.
And so we were glued and glued.
We can't even touch the boots so they don't get hurt by chance.
So there's a real need for engagement.
Mario made me happy when my creation, without exception, praised.
I mean, that's not really my girlfriend.
This is just a small fraction of what we heard about the second weekend continuation of the course.
I'm starting to be more clear that to devote yourself to styling at the professional level is really not a walk of pink fruit, let anyone say what he wants.
In Need for Speed: The Run runs across America.
Reviews
Originally an old-fashioned ride, due to a series of completely unnecessary leftover mistakes, changes in the routine morning trip to the sleigh.
Ambition, though, has succeeded to a significant extent, but it is not valid when no one has clearly wanted to do anything else.
A new piece with the title The Run was built before the issue of high expectations.
He promised that the flight's series Need for Speed would shift a little further in the new direction and from playable shows appeared as a game that in the race of action race should not only be counted.
We were also curious about what would happen to the inserted passports in which the main hero would come out of the car and run after his own.
As with the NFS series, many are a little different from what we expected.
They're potentially decent arcade races, but the whole pulls down a few unnecessary mistakes that have appeared in the series for almost a few years.
So it's not really a mistake, but it's more of a demonstration of some sort of incomprehensible vulnerability of the developers.
The adventure is starting very well.
You are mentioned in a story whose main hero Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You will be seated on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to arrive as the first one in New York.
The idea is that there are a few interesting elements.
The track is divided into ten stages, and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race goes on a different course and the given stages are engaged in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
A man doesn't even have a moment to feel like he's still offering the game.
Some of the environments are also very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graph corresponds to the previous sections of the series.
So it's nothing global.
But the journey across the desert, the subterranean landscape, or high in snowy mountains, works visually very pleasant.
In addition, the competitions have been gripped from time to time with some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you get into a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you need to be careful not to be caught by a lion.
Besides, they're pretty good at each other's competitions.
There's only a few of them, but that's enough.
You're trying to spend the required number of competitors (mainly a classic race), then you're running out of time (classic battle with your feet) and then you need to have a duel with your only opponent.
The police will also be involved from time to time, which continues to make all your efforts even more unpleasant.
The news is passports outside the car.
It's just an interactive animation, when Jack most of the time pushes in front of someone, and you have to help him in that way so you can print the right button at the right time.
It's nothing complicated.
But it will surprise you that these matches are much less in the game than you would expect (in particular maybe only three).
The result is, however, to the benefit of things, because this element has no chance to get upset and, in the context of the above, it appears to be a series of elements that interfere with the game.
The driving model goes in the footsteps of the previous works.
That means it's definitely no longer anybody in today's time, but it can't be said to be resistance.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But more specifically, the current driving model still works quite well, even though we could find better at competition.
Until then, everything's perfectly all right.
But problems start to emerge after a while.
Unlike the driver's model, there's no knee model anymore.
We don't expect this type of game to include complex deformations and collisions, but if you don't have the least idea how your car behaves, then it's probably not all right.
Typically, when you drive or change cars in normal operation, you will sometimes just get lighter and lighter, but another time in almost identical situation will end your car in wild pirates.
Or even a straight attack.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter at all, but it'll let you down safely.
The restarts are solved in such a way that if you break up or go far outside the track, you will be thrown back to the last catch point on the track.
However, only five restarts are available in each race.
Once you're exhausted, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it's more of a help in case there's nothing going to happen than you could actually rely on them.
Sometimes, however, no restarts can help, it solves the need to learn to remember a certain race.
The big inhaler of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some bets need a project in a specific way, otherwise you will not be able to see them in a short time.
Otherwise you will meet again in a given place "civil" cars always in the same configuration whether you come there first, Friday, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially so in situations where you see a rival between two anti-driving cars passing easily before you, while when you get there, there are already cars in such a position that you have to drive them or speed them up.
It doesn't matter when you get to them, because it's "calculated" so that the situation is always right in front of your nose.
The rivals have another advantage.
During the game you will find several places where you will again, regardless of time, always run the same opponent in the same place.
Mostly it blows at the end of the game on the long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
The opponent must get in front of you, obviously, at any price.
If he's going in front of you, he's making it worse for you to take a look at the anti-trafficking cars, so at first you're getting a lot of mass.
The intention is to make the game more sophisticated and more effective, but the implementation is so obvious that it will probably kill you quickly.
And it's a shame, because even through a simple driving model, it's playing fun and places and so much action that sometimes literally you don't have to watch where it's flying.
And basically it doesn't matter whether he deserves to have a concept of fifty unique tracks, sort of races so that the nude doesn't have a chance, or anything else.
A non-traditional idea is the exchange of cars during the race.
You have to pay attention to petrol pumps on the road, because you can change the car right there, even though in most cases you will have enough of what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
The athletes are suitable for urban areas, strong American boulevards on equal streets and exotic supersports on technical riding, for example on the clicked mountain trails.
The main story mode goes hand in hand and way of challenge, which are races in individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only the medals, but also the experience points in your profile, which is common to challenges and stories.
To obtain a higher level of drivers, different items are removed: start cars and end with backgrounds for profile.
It is also connected again with the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares your achieved results with other players and has other community functions.
One of the other hard-to-understanding mines is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your vehicle you will reach the metro tunnel (Be) where you will marry in darkness (Be) on your knees (Be).
On the tachometer, you can see the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (begin) in the back of the meter set and you are uncompromising.
In the editorial, we're probably still having a discussion for a few days about whether nobody really thought about the game, or whether the authors really have such a big stupidity.
The technical page of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It's so freezing that in some of the most busy moments, it's getting a little bit of a picture, and in some cases, it's pretty tragic.
But this is particularly true of a drill with a larger number of participants, if you don't have any gas footage.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a question of taste.
In an effort to love the widest scale of the younger audience, a soundtrack of the category "every dog other grass", but it can be assumed that because of listening to music the game will probably not be bought by someone like that.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so dissipated.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary mistakes, then we wouldn't be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
That's how the game works.
The fun is definitely fine, but be prepared to see that errors will blow into your eyes by the force of the airport reflectors.
The singing congregations of the UK will sound at the concert Students of the Summit
The association of the International Study Day and the Year of the Samet Revolution with the musical experience offers the third festival of Fest Academy.
During this time he will be represented in twenty high school and high school singing congregations.
The main focus of the festival is two concerts held on 17 November.
"University of Karlo has a big share in the festival."
"Among the participating congregations, the Pévetský  Facultí Fédagogique and the Faculty of Humanitarian Studies, the director of Václav Hampl, chaired the festival committee," said Jakub Čaloun, head of the organisation team.
The summit of the entire festival is a freely accessible public concert of high school congregations, which will take place on 17 November from 14 hours to the screen in front of the National Technical Library in Djvic.
On the program is a composition of a significant Czech jazzman Karla Rosičky Celebration Jazz Mass.
In the evening hours, the concert "Students of the Summit" will be held at the National House of Vinohradach, where the colleges will be held, including the singing congregations of the University of Karlov.
Festa Academia aims not only to celebrate the International Student Day and to remind the 22nd anniversary of the Samet Revolution, but also to present the public of the congregation music at the highest level and to develop creative cooperation of young people.
The Union of Czech Singular Assemblys in cooperation with Jan Kepler Gymnasium is the lead singer.
Over the course of the action, they took over the protection of the Prime Minister of Prague Bohuslav Svoboda and the head of the University of Karlov Václav Hampl.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
The harmonogram also offers a whole range of concerts, student happenings, mating and other shows.
Detailed information will be found on the website of the festival www.festaacademica.cz
At EU level, Vicen:
Czechs have the reputation of negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly violated the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years before the situation gets a little settled, calmed and all the players are used to their new roles," the Czech Embassy at the European Union Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
Since its motto "Sensibly and openly about Europe" is taken seriously, it has already shown in the first part of the lecture when it has been able to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a transparent and understandable way that a number of lecturers from the UK Faculty of Law could envy it.
The Vice-President also welcomed the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuye:
"There was a criticism earlier that it was insignificant that it was a gray official that could not play any role, and I must say that everyone had a breath that the role was excellent."
"It is a person who can listen to the twenty-seven Member States, communicate with them perfectly and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new High Representative's post for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained in answer to the question, "Who is this European Union? What phone number should I call?", that is, as a significant step towards unity and greater readability of EU policies towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid us any peanuts.
Vicenová has also dedicated herself to an agenda that the European Council has lived, and will live as soon as possible.
The pre-accession Czech Presidency has been a success.
The Czechs solved the emerging financial crisis, solved the gas crisis, or arranged summits for the Eastern Partnership.
The government's fall at this time was marked by a great negative that has seriously damaged the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very thorough.
In the words of the speaker, the "fmol fact" was not only a Presidency, but also the next financial crisis that is going to take place to date.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union must be approved, which is making the current economic situation much more complicated.
Whether the budget will be smooth and sustainable, which sectors will gain priority, which countries will be supported more and less, this is all in the order of the next negotiations.
She also recalled her main slogans with which she came to Brussels: "About Europe Understandable".
"I really don't like ugly shorts, foreign words, a gloves that no one understands.
How do the citizens understand that there are really no curved or bullet-shaped cuts in Brussels, bananas of different sizes, or that someone really has to ban us from acidic."
He also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
Multi-speed Europe is waiting for us
According to the embassy, the Czechs have the reputation of Eurosceptics and people who are paying more attention to these negative than positive pages of things.
She also regrets the low representation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
According to it, there are many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four have been raised.
"Believe me that when Poland and Hungary come to me and the Slovak is approaching, then the French next to me will say, "Hey, what do you see in there, what do you see in your Visegrad four?" and they don't really care."
In the future, according to the Vice-Presidents, there are, in particular, new tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As a very real then, the concept of two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, is more than a new "European Federation."
"We have the eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone."
"We have Schengen space, we already have a strong cooperation institution."
"It was first said that only countries that wanted to cooperate, and those that didn't want to, should be allowed to fall."
"These institutions will be more and will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicenová expects.
In this regard, it also assessed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye in the adoption of the principle that all issues affecting the Union as a whole should be discussed between all Member States, not only between the euro area countries.
Burn story:
Innovator IBM starts its second century of existence
If anyone were looking for a word that would be the most precise of IBM's strategy, it'd probably be "longevity."
For the general public IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is introduced as a very modern company, and has been a hundred years since its establishment.
Based on this longevity, the company's first boss, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already breached the password that a number of world problems can easily be solved if people are willing to think.
His password "Think!" became so printed that the life of the future giant will take place (and also the name of the internal magazine, which began in IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her basic values, and then she was not afraid to change everything else around her.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second century we will be able to achieve even more," said the current director of Samuel J. Palmisano for the year.
Processed system
Watson, in his thirties, went to care for his employees, like the Báča business in Czech Republic - people from IBM had a pay leave as one of the first American employees, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform, and a developed system to reward the best employees and traders.
It has the same long-term IBM and its relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, society has been brilliant in the pursuit of talents - as one of the first world companies has eliminated any discrimination, so she could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana in the head of IBM is setting up a woman - Virginia Rometti.
This in IBM has been working for 30 years, is still the position of sales, marketing and strategy leader.
In recent years IBM has made so-called jams, online brainstormings, which have created many future strategies and innovations.
It's not surprising that ideas are enough - almost half a million people work in the company.
Good Name Institution
A firm position in the business ensures the company's strong internal and external image.
"In the beginning IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," said Professor Harvard Business School Economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," George Colony of Forrester Research Consultant.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market at the same time.
IBM - or "The Great Blue", as it is familiar with its logo in the United States - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a hundred years.
It is probably the largest technological firm - developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in the product scale from servers to nanotechnology.
She holds the most patents from all American technology companies and five of her employees received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include ATMs, payment cards, financial swaps, line code or diskettes.
IBM has become the second largest technology firm in the market capitalisation (first Apple) this year, when Microsoft was first introduced in 1996.
Front View
Not all products and innovations come into the taste of customers and times - IBM for example did not prove its commitment to its own OS/2 operating system, on-line services Prodigy or PCjr PC.
"If your business is put on the front, you cannot use yourself emotionally in the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, then leave them.
Unlike the competitive Microsoft, which is in principle standing and falling on the Windows operating system.
Prospective technologies
In IBM markets, the largest share of services, about five are software and hardware.
However, in 1990 he was with more than half the most powerful representative of hardware.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-cost assets worth $15 billion, while also investing $58 billion in the purchase of forward-looking technologies.
The investment continues since 2008, when the world first experienced a recent financial crisis.
IBM is one according to his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investment during the major economic crisis.
So far, it seems IBM is going through the current crisis unaffected.
The price of IBM shares has risen by 120 per cent since the beginning of 2008 and the net profits of the company are constantly increasing.
The firm password IBM is to change everything, just not its values.
That's why it can be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will be able to handle it.
History IBM: From cheese-sweeting to space
IBM (International Business Machines) was created in New York a hundred years ago and originally had a complex name Computing Tableling Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was taken up until 1924 - it was originally a brand used for branches of companies in Canada and South America.
The basis for IBM's subsequent merger was four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They own technology like the famous "pitches," which means hours of recording employees' arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company's Supervisory Board in 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson's head of competition to help him run the company.
The leader then shielded the founders of IBM - in Watson's thinking, an indestructible corporate culture and identity has been built so far.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as indicated by its name, began with the production and sale of all-powerful machines for business - from the tailors of meat and cheese after the store.
During the first four years of Watson’s leadership, he doubled the turnover of nine million dollars and began to expand the company’s expansion into all parts of the world.
Watson was so rude to the company that almost 40 years later his son, Thomas Watson Junior, was expelled from the chair.
Under his leadership IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA fly to space - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous year of man on the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "peak", which created the computer standard of the time, with the name IBM 5150 came into the market in 1981.
About 20 years later IBM sold the Chinese computer production of Lenovo, on the other hand bought a consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote itself fully to advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been paying off in the last three years is the concept of the Smarter Planet.
Its aim is to use technology wisely in the current state of the art, not even in unplanned areas, but to improve the situation, for example in urban transport or management.
Recently, IBM launched a Smarter Commerce platform to help traders run the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history even in the country.
She founded her branch in then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a research team at the world level dealing with the recognition of the vote.
A prospector for an unfaithful husband:
Iveto, get the fuck out of here, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Richtāřová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Joseph Richtār (53) became not only the guardian of Ivety Bartošov (45), but also the lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from pink sleep and return home.
But now she's not ready to wait, and she's set clear rules for another life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," Richtārová explained.
When Darina Richtārová offered her asylum in her home in the summer, she probably didn't even see her marriage ending.
Although Iveta moved out of the river after 30 days, Pep did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted he loved her.
Through Darina’s time, she resigned, and her relationship with her husband has calmed down, and now she has even given him a good name.
The fisherman doesn't care who his wife's sleeping with
If the Knight and Bartos had only separated once, his wife's hand open will not be waiting at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will drive him away."
"Not as my beloved old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," Richtārová told her that she had already given up on her husband and continued to obey each other.
Joseph, the fact that Darina locked his back door doesn't matter yet.
"I respect the wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and I won't change it."
"The husband has arranged a paper marriage, and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I'm taking care of repair, garden, real estate, I'm buying."
"Darino and I have a totally normal time, except we don't share the beds together," Bleska Richtrář said.
If she also finds a new love, she won't be able to defend it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, and if he has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility for myself," Joseph closed.
The worst women's abuses: do they concern you too?
When you ask men if they could name some typical female vices, they're usually all out of the glove very soon.
Ladies and gentlemen, do you know in the following lines where there are a number of women's abuses that can perfectly shed blood in the veins to men?
Shopping
Does your second half tell you you're dependent on buying?
Do you have to buy yourself at least one hat a week?
Do you like to buy in discounts together?
Then, in your case, you can talk about buying as a crime.
Some women realize that they should have at least a little crush on their shopping passion.
But tell me, who would resist it just to walk around the store with clothes, look for good falling ends and then try all of them (ideally in different color versions) in the cabin?
Although for most women buying a horse, for men it can be literally a hell of a lot.
Just remember how many times you told your friend to wait for you before the entrance...
Unrelenting Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I should lose at least five pounds - should I start practicing?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Don't these words remind you of anything?
Is that right?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with how they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their views.
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more the women are upset.
Order and purity in first place
It's like an endless cycle.
Clears the windows, wipes, wipes the hair, wipes the dust, shakes the bath - and at least twice a week.
You're telling your partner that you've been sneaking a dirty leg on a clean chair, the kids that they've poisoned the drained washroom, and they've turned down the damn living wall with which you've done so much work?
In case you're suffering from this "pull", try to realize that nothing should be overlooked and order and purity should certainly not be within the family first.
This unharmed desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationship and family atmosphere.
Rape
"Those used coaches throw in the trash."
"Will you take those old socks on you tomorrow too?"
"The wet blade doesn't belong on the ground."
If that's how you mess with your partner a few times a day, you know you'll be able to handle it in a reliable way.
Of course, you don't mean anything wrong, but you want to make it all right.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn't have had to rip it up so much again...
Apologize, pruritus
For some women, they are also their own talks, jokes, but also insulting and arguing with someone.
Women are focused on relationships, and so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
I hope each of us has a little harmless vortex or a curse out there.
Hands on your heart, it's your own for all women.
On the other hand, the brooms of the worst grain, which are often broomed, may be difficult for everyone and are particularly dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the female working group.
Jagr and Voráček helped with the victory assistance of Philadelphia
The hockey attacker Jaromír Jagr participated in the NHL's Monday match with two assistances for the victory of Philadelphia 5:3 on Carolina's ice and is again in front of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux, a nine-year-old star, who added another recording and was declared the best player in the game.
Two assists in the match also recorded Jakub Voraček's partner.
The Jagr said after the battle with the foreign journalists that he had predicted a big night for Giroux.
"Before the match, I told him he'd get a hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes such a feeling will break you," explained Jagr, after whose action Giroux gave the goal of the first shot of the Flyers.
About a minute later, he had a second strike on the Czech team.
The Voráček fought for a white Hurricanes cat and presented it between the circles of Max Talbot.
The second before the first break was reduced in the weakening home player Patrick Dwyer, but the second part was again part of the Flyers.
specifically to Giroux.
After working with Jagre, he shot a third goal, after which his shot crossed the line in the fourth branch of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league, but he certainly belongs among the best three," I appreciated his center.
"I would never have thought I'd end my career with a hockey player like him."
"I'm happy to do that."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL my associates tried to play me, now it's turning," Jagr added.
Caroline from the match was still making a drama, the crowd of Tuoma Routua, and again Dwyer, who suffered from a criminal shooting, got the difference between one branch.
Another complication, however, did not allow Matt Read, who decided to renumber two on one.
"He's got a good shot in our Pronger band."
"He's sucking the cat, I've picked up the speed and (Read) went to the far end."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," described the last line of the match from his perspective.
Philadelphia won the Eastern Conference.
Czech defender Montreal Jaroslav Špatak did not win the match against Buffal, in the second third he resigned for injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candiens also lost two-legged leadership along with the experienced beak and lost two-legged to the penalty range 2:3.
One of their rides hasn't changed Tomás Plekanec.
The home coach more than the lost points hated the vast marodka of the back row, with only five defenders playing the game.
"It's bad."
"We played the run with only one experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do with it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"We couldn't resist the control."
"We should have simplified the game more, removed the crack from our band."
We had gaps in it," added one of the defenders of P. K. Subban.
The Czech barrister Andrzej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg's attacks to a 5:2 victory over Tampou Bay.
About the jets that broke down the five-way series, five different shooters were divided.
How arrival prices have evolved since 1989
By 1989 only five state travel offices were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in the dry majority only entry to the socialist bloc country, as travel to the west was very limited.
The Czech tourists so traveled on a holiday to the sea to NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Soci na Krym u Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime joined the West and Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that it was not possible for citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) to travel freely on an individual basis even within socialist countries.
In case the citizens of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, for example, they needed a letter from that country, otherwise it was not an individual journey possible.
The travel offices at that time also offered trips to the West, but there was a need to stand the front over the night with a pack or to have in the travel office "well known".
That's not how it was won.
The so-called foreign currency pledge, which was a condition for the journeys to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people", who could not go out at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, without a foreign currency pledge, so it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) on the West road.
However, far more often the Czechs spent their vacation abroad, which resulted in a large number of chats and chalapses that Czechs have settled and this habit survives to this day.
Traveling the Czechs has experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While the NDR or Bulgaria were allowed by our maximum in 1989, the summers spent Czechs abroad 4.5 million people in countries around the world.
The huge paradox that we are not aware of today is that for us today, the most popular Croatia was not able to travel freely until 1989, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In the late 1990s, visa obligations were abolished in the neighbouring Western European countries, starting with a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Vienna or Germany.
The Czechs couldn't afford to travel to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to take a look at it for a second.
For example, in Paris the Czech tickets to the apartments were burned, since our then incomes did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a pension.
The typical drawing of the Czech trip was at this time driving its own food, canned, salads, etc. to save it.
Another important moment was the introduction of freely interchangeable Czech crowns, which our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency free after many decades.
However, our standard of living and the average payments have risen, which has dropped around 1997 at another important moment.
As a result of the increased demand for travel, travel officials have been regularly preparing flights with charter airline connections since 1997, with the possibility to negotiate multiple discounts in comparison with the past.
By the end of the 90th century, Czechs had had virtually no connection with all the developed countries of the world, except for the United States, which still made our journey easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of evolutionary travel occurred in 2000 immediately, when due to considerable demand from the Czech Republic, the first direct charter flight to exoticity was made to Thailand.
From this year on, every year Czech tourists fly direct charters to warm, far-off countries, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting about 100,000 Czechs annually!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our evolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States cancelled a visa for Czech tourists and thus our countries definitely joined the most successful countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half of their foreign leave (50.3%) in history for the first time, and lost for the first time in history for one foreign leave including the cost of staying in the area of more than 15,000 CZK per person.
The Valna assembly is supposed to find the president, but again he's threatening the floor.
For almost five months, Czech football is without a president and threatens that the successor Ivan Haška will not even know the Czech Football Association (FAČR) after another extraordinary event that will take place in Nymburce on Thursday.
However, there is still no agreement under which the electoral order will be taken.
Without it, no vote will begin on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest in leading Czech football has Jindrich Rachel, Miroslav Pelt and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June and, at his departure, called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
However, in an era after Haskova, he made his way back to the track between the two bond chambers, which could not agree with the joint candidate.
It was fully demonstrated on 16 September when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates gathered at the National House in Prague on Smíchove, because the discussion was blocked and not just about the way it was chosen.
There was no consensus on who had the right to vote in the assembly in fact - whether only the statutory representatives or the officials of the office had full power.
At this only point, since then, a partial agreement has been established, which has also helped in the recommendation of the Constitution for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
However, there is still a problem with the electoral order.
Nor has the Executive Committee referred to the situation very clearly, which, in its deliberations, whether it is right or wrong, does not solve in principle anything else.
The view of the option of election has changed several times, but the neurologic point is still the same.
The question is, how to proceed in the third round to exclude the possibility of a pat?
"The dispute is whether to act in accordance with the terms or to find another model," noted one of the three Vice-Chairmen FAČR Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the terms of the proposed model in the third round, one of the candidates will win, which will have higher percentage support in the chamber than he will apply for.
The Morava is supposed to be willing to go to the election in order to win the candidate, which will receive a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech party advocates the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds of the weight of the gain in this percentage calculation.
"But then it would lose the meaning of the two previous wheels, it would completely deny the two-wheel concept," grasps the opposition of the Moravian Party of Freedom, according to which it would be best not to avoid and vote according to the current states.
This is a bit of a surprise to Tomáš Paclík, although it is estimated that the electoral order of the states is the highest of all candidates in Pelt.
"I wish it had been chosen as a matter of fact."
"To avoid any reprehensible nonsense as on the previous wave assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzeň, who was first candidate and in his statements he was first opposed to Pelt.
Pelta remains an optimist.
According to him, the new president will know and believe that candidates will work constructively in the future.
"All of us will be very happy with the possible process of the national team today at the European Championship."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, it will be more willing to work together," says the apple artist, who has three of the greatest experiences with football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rachel's more persistent.
"I hope the deal, but unfortunately the situation is very disbanded."
"It's not between Czech and Moravia people, but there are efforts to adapt to the rules."
"This may cause the blockage of the entire assembly to come again."
"But I hope he wins a healthy mind," said Rachel.
There's no time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some of the talks were supposed to be played directly in Montenegro, but who is to say that the football generality will be complete in the fight.
The flight special in which they were to travel to Podgorica, among other things, the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rachel, because of the technical break in the morning, did not fly from Prague and sought a replacement option to transport part of the executive committee to the resort.
Finally, a decision-making meeting at the ministerial level may be expected to take place on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Body Josef Dobeš would like to bring the disbanded parties within the country's strongest sports association to an agreement.
In the game there are many: state grants, football confidentiality and also a Vala collection of ČSTVs, which will address new Czech sport direction on the financial problems of Sazka.
The hell is going to fight for the president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If the leader of the footballers Plzno Tomáš Paklík saw a strong candidate in front of the extraordinary wave assembly, who would fulfill all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) and would not join in the struggle for the top function.
"If there was a quality adept, I'd fight for it and I wouldn't make a choice."
"But in the current situation, no one has succeeded in finding such a person," said CTC Paclík.
To fight with Miroslav Pelt and Jindřich Rachel's wife Paclík's motivation to try to stop Pelt, the alleged favorite choice, in the way to the FAČR.
It also stresses that, in the event of his victory, he would only stand in the role of the President until 2013, when there is a proper wave of events on the programme.
In this function, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not too involved with football.
"I spoke to some people who would come to mind."
"It was crazy for me when some people said they didn't even want to identify with Czech football at the moment."
"That's what I'd like to change," he said.
Paklíkovi is now leading the most important connection of Pelt to the President of the Plzeńsk Regional Football Association Roman Berbre, a man with controversial history, who is known in the background as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates on the rolling mass.
It's so unacceptable for Paklíka that Pelta is in the presidential position.
"If he wins, the current state is served and nothing in the football will move forward."
"In combination with Berbra's support, which is a powerful dealer, it would not have worked more," said Paclík.
They also insist that Pelt's name was recorded in the envoys during the investigation of the corruption affair, but Pelta left without a penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paklík, who is also taking over his earlier sentence that he would "sold the Pulce Club if Pelta became president".
If Paclík would triumph in the fourth election, he would be able to present future cooperation with Pelt.
He also considers another Rachel candidate, whom Paclík supported in front of the lightning wave mass, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him as the head of the representation."
"But management wouldn't be able to run an association."
"I also don't wear my nose where I can't," said Paclík, who in September aroused great attention by standing behind the withdrawal of the committee of decision-makers in front of Human Macel, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Hell claims he'd run an association troufl.
He refers to his ability to run private companies, and since last summer he has also led the Plzens, who, with his support in May, celebrated the Prime Minister's league triumph.
"I have the power to change anything in the football environment to contribute to its specific cultivation."
"To limit the effects of some interest groups that need to be affected by the disciplinary and appeal commission, which goes to unpleasant situations," said Paklík, who is not hiding their antipathy, for example to the Spartan chief Daniel Kretínski.
One of the priorities would also be to consider the strengthening of FAČR's relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it would use political peaks to lobby for more money from lottery tax to sport.
"It's one of the key things the new president should be committed to."
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties say, I understand their arguments, but at the level they have to say where the money is going," he noted.
As a complaint now, Paclík does not even accept his connection to the Pleson Club, although he claims that the president of FAČR should be "online".
Pelta's connected to Jablonce again, Rachel to the Prague Dock.
"It's not perfect."
"But I don't see the point of converting my stock to someone's cover at the Pulsa Club and for a year and a half back there," Paklík said.
Pelta promised new FAČR states that would exclude the election path
Two days ago, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that in the event of an election, the FAČR would have new positions that would definitely rule out disputes over the electoral agenda in the future.
The Jabloneck official is an optimist prior to Thursday's negotiations in Nymburce and believes that the pre-election struggle will significantly influence the possible success of the football representation today.
The Pelta had already promised before the September election that it would focus on the representation and acquisition of finance in the case of the election.
In the election before the last wave, he decided to go to the last minute, and then a two-month delay could be given to him to defend his ideas of football management and to present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect the president to know on Thursday."
"He feels that it is the best time for an association to lead," says a man who is primarily associated with an apple club, but who has been active in Sparta for many years and the executive board of the alliance.
And that's why he thinks he has enough experience to drive Czech football.
He is convinced that the current problems with the election are euphoria, which prevailed during the reign of Ivan Haška.
"Unfortunately, at the Red Vale Assembly there were approved states that were not as perfect as they all thought."
"If different interpretations were not allowed, we had the president since September," Pelta pointed out.
The recast of the most important document of the civil society has served as a tool for delegates.
"If I become the president, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to assume personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a basic thing we can't be without," says Pelta.
I mean, he's still trying not to be out against his rivals.
He had previously warned that he could present himself with Jindrich Rachel, whom he recognized for his legal education, and well knows that his opposition would be his first vice president.
He hasn't even attacked Tomás Paclík for a long time, and he didn't leave a dry one on Pelt.
"Something moves in football over the year, has already achieved some success."
"But his attacks were invincible, and many people in the way of election campaign were shocked."
"That's why a number of them now doubt his true character," said Pelt's opponent's address, who remains faithful to the proclamation he announced in September.
According to him, his most powerful weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest competitions until after the representation.
That should be a football club.
"And I would also try to put an end to all the affairs of the cause of the Bohemians or the sounds of the last corruption scandal."
"Now I would like to go to the private and state sector to ensure that we have enough money for the whole football," the CTC said a six-year-old candidate two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his coming to the front of football would mean no personal cleaning.
"I should first get to know the full number of employees," he pointed out to the Fear, where an understandable nervousness prevails from the long-term government.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are taking place, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburg for the rest of the day on Thursday.
"If it's the only controversial point of how to vote in the third round, then we can move through it."
"Football needs credibility, and here it only gets by finally having its leader again," Pelta remains two days ago, perhaps deciding on the day of her functional career as an optimist.
Rachel promises that under it FAČR would start working hard
If the new president of the Czech Republic's Football Association had been elected vice-president Jindřich Reichl on the fourth round, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rachel, in fact, promises that in the case of his election, he will start working hard.
He wants to bring about system changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the cause of Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and continue in the work initiated by previous President Ivan Hasek.
"As president, I would like to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football after youth."
"But I'm not saying that I'd do everything myself," said Rachel in a conversation for the CTC.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the competence within the executive committee so that each member will be dedicated to certain areas."
"And I'm going to give a hard task to move football forward in each of these segments."
"Many people would probably not be happy because they would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he thought he wouldn't run again.
"I'm known to be doing 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will always throw their fists under my feet and question every step of my life," he explained.
"Many people told me I couldn't give it up, because then they would give it up to others."
"It's a trust I can't just throw," he said.
It also motivates him to continue in the work he started with Haske.
"In those two years, a lot of work has been done, and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are ongoing processes that will be heard within a few years, and I do not want anyone to stop them," he said with concern that in the event of another candidate Miroslav Pelty's election, the situation on the bond could be restored until before the Haske.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's what I don't think Mirek Pelt can do."
"He's the most bound up people who would make football so he'd be just chosen for you."
"I can count a lot of things, but it's certainly not that of someone else."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then they'll all be well and not just your election," Rachel noted.
He's cheating and claiming he'd only be the Czech president.
"Even if some people are trying to argue otherwise, I'm going to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into a Czech and Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would be no current situation where only three Moravian totals are in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Rachel.
Since he also took part in the fight for the president and the head of the Pulsan Club Tomáš Paclík, Rachel will not be able to estimate her chances of election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its vice-president and sees that I have clear successes," said Rachel, who considers the saving of tens of millions of crowns in unfavourable contracts, the negotiation of television contracts and the negotiation of lottery law.
On the other hand, he's thinking that the bond doesn't end up in one line.
While Pelt claims that he is "disqualified from returning Czech football to trust", the second of Paklík's competitors is considered a strong candidate who has a football to offer.
"No one can doubt he's done a great job in the Gulf this year."
"If he had been elected, he would have continued in the things that Ivan Hasek started here and would not, in principle, have changed his personal position in the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to do it for his own good," Rachel's evaluation of the rival.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
Julia Stanek
From the point of view of Ufona, the shopping pool in Budapest: Who travels Europe can enjoy his blue miracle - and after visiting cities or traveling let his tired feet rest in thermal spas.
The book shows where wellness is at the most beautiful water.
When Iris Meder was released in the past one and a half years on open roads, she should not have been missing in her pocket: her swimsuits.
Laying signs on the water, she looked up to the height of the artistry of the pool, swimming across the marble road (putting a little naked boy, child (with wings)) waiting for her on the edge of the pool and admired carefully restored secession vessels.
If she was attracted to some craft, she took it to her mother - with remarkable details about how to build and the history of the building.
More than 200 sailors have examined in this way the historic architecture of Meder and now presents them in their recently published book "Badefreuden (Badfreuden of bathing)" : People's swimming pools in Munich, the historic palace of rafts in Schwarzwald, "The solid core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "The path to the most unusual spas in Central Europe": near Germany, Austria and Switzerland visited localities in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old Germany is a truly enthusiastic raft culture.
With sport it doesn't get too high, says Meder - it's just something else in the water.
The relationship is that fans swimming must be satisfied with blue petals and the smell of chlorine, while healthy runners can breathe the humid smell of smear forests or listen to the cheerful glowing of birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why the swimming pools must always be so expensive," says Mrs. Meder in Vienna.
"That's how I started gathering nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Swim in the ski pool and essential oil for the sauna - the factor of the weather is therefore so great that it concerns all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the sailors could be the real feed for the eyes: "The place of the floor is man in the watery watery."
"But it's transparent, on the other hand, but it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is optically divided: high clenbing, sticky hooks, jumpy pecks.
The Maloformat image link "Badfreuden" on 190 pages provides everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oasis wellnes - but especially the taste of jumping into the blue.
The remarkable specimens discovered Mrs. Meder's sailing collector during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful healing baths, like 100 years of old Szechenyi baths in Budapest, she found water with the contents of the vacuums in the original beautiful cave (excellent spa in Miskolc-Tapolca) and the thermal spa whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are placed in the shape of a bottle (Városi Termámfürdö in Jásberé).
In contrast to this, many heated vessels are offered under the wide sky in Switzerland and Austria. As long as a person has from the Curasian top bath in the eyes of the city, the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton can be seen on the snow covered Arlberg - and: In the steam baths there is a window from which it is possible to monitor the movement of the ski resort.
The most remarkable design of the swimming pool is expected by guests in Langenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like a ufo that just landed in the Alps.
From the top three open decks in the winter, a pair rises until the background of the Ötztal mountain lies to the sky.
Alhambra and Schwarzwald
Not every swimming pool collector, Mrs. Meder, stepped into the chorus.
Many thermal spas are smelling after cheese, in the spas of Arpád in Hungary’s Békessaba, it smells like hot oil to the extent that one hardly believes he has reached the treatment spas.
Zapach comes from therapeutic water containing alkaline hydrocarbons, which is almost black and its ingredients are glued to the skin as soon as only one enters the pool - some special experience of wellness.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for nice bathrooms: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and air-conditioning spa Luhačovice, she arrived at the closed area.
In 1902 the architect Dušan Jurkovic designed bathrooms were closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the falling windows of the red-white-yellow session buildings, she saw how the splendour between the tiles could grow.
The fence was built against it in the magic shop in Schwarzwald: in Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These bathrooms already have three stages of construction; one can discover not only the novel elements from the time of their creation in 1844, but also the maurice shadow in the style of Alhambra, which was connected around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, Palais Thermal has been the favorite spa resort of Mrs. Iris Meder's swimming pools, not just because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's already some power to connect so many construction structures to such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
In such a palace, underground in the thermal pool is obviously a coastal matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets you check the Commodity Trade
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to the information SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned the working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
Then, in January, the head of the group wants to draw the results out.
Hamburg -
It is clear to the public that 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions come out of this trade because the problems of the worst world are deepening.
This is the result of the Forsa survey from the mandate of the Foodwatch Consumer Organisation.
The study is based on the report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that global commodity exchanges are driven to high prices, and banks are therefore co-operating on the world hunger problem.
Consumer protection campaign is targeted specifically against Chief Deutsche Bank Joseph Ackermann, even though large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
Originally, comedy bets were meant to ensure that traders were against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, most experts agree that participants in the capital market with an interest in high-risk trades have withdrawn from supply and demand - and have gained profits on account of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, he reacted to Ackermann's criticism: he promised that the results would be verified and said that no trade "is worth a good reputation for Deutsche Bank in the bet".
According to the information SPIEGEL ONLINE, the International Foodwatch-Report Working Group controls.
By the end of the year, the audit will be closed and the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to apply it.
At the end of January, the representatives of the bank wanted to tell the consequences.
Finally, there could be a reduction in trade in Commodities or even a complete refusal.
Ackermann works self-help on his image.
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time reinforced his criticism of the financial sector: "The rise in food prices shows particularly drastic how banks today harm the general welfare."
Let Ackermann be the highest bank lobbyist in the world.
"Deutsche Bank must shorten out of its portfolio all the items in which money is used for food price bets," Bode said.
"I wonder if Mr. Ackermann is about the hunger of people suffering or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view appears at first glance as surprising, but it is clear that the group leader would like to leave the perfect picture a few months before he leaves the office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the representation would not go to the Supervisory Board otherwise than planned.
By turning away from the controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about the possible loss - he should finally advise his successor.
Anyone else would say investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have been involved in the campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which 1001 people were questioned by the Forsa Institute on 7 and 8 November.
According to this, it is only eleven per cent that Deutsche Bank is offering investments that are linked to food price commitments.
Many bank customers would also derive personal consequences if they found out that their bank is involved in such transactions: Each other would, as a result of the survey, account for all investments in which money flows into speculation with raw materials.
43 per cent would warn known to such a bank, 49 per cent indicated that they were thinking about answering their account and going to another institution.
House of the 21st Century in Vienna
Moved pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The history of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won prices, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and abandoned.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition house.
When it is heated for modern military architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold disguises and new construction materials typical of the faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is an outstanding and famous example.
Schwanzer's pavilion then received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and highly effective steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered to be a milestone of the current architecture.
He praised the architect so that during the next world exhibition, he built the pavilion of Austria.
With its legendary four-walled BMW-floor plus as a key to the side building in Munich, it was celebrated internationally at the end of 1973.
His temporary exhibition building, which was designed after the world exhibition, was built at Schweizer Garten at the Viennese Südbahnhof (South Station), rebuilt and opened in 1962 the Museum of the 20th century - it was named the "House of the 20th century".
But it was not suitable for the museum of the building, either spatially or technically - the walls were lacking to hang artistic exhibits, no suitable climate.
However, it was used until the current art reached Vienna's new station.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has been chatting more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz pavilion has rebuilt, now bearing the name "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Modern Art.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, which belongs to the palace, will open the first exhibition - a happy goal in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere, took place in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a leading historical art with a significant career, including in the young tailor-made, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's Museum, and as the founder of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, has passed on a significant reconstruction of politicians and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsorship money and determined its use.
In addition to the current art, the works of the associate Fritz Wotruby should be exhibited with the same hope, coffee and bookstores should be created, and an office building should be set up to do so.
Full surveillance, low budget.
Then Krischanitz was the ideal siege.
Not only did he rebuild and expand Joseph Olbrich's sessional buildings in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the University of Technology in Vienna and was for him "an extremely important place", where he attended the exhibition "most every weekend".
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its greatness and ease when moving to Vienna.
At the present reconstruction there were far more problems: the building was "a catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The profiles of the glass facades were replaced, used by glass fibers damaged insulating glass and glass roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold steel bridges were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings were repaired.
Two underground floors have provided space for new use, abandoned lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, leading to the entrance of the bridge - almost new building, but still an excellent Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is decorated in the old anti-corrosion red tones.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it was before.
And it's all under the strict supervision of the memory office and the low budget.
"It often had to be found material that was good and cheap and also liked the memory office," says Krischanitz and points to a broken basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
The difficult thing was with the pavilion, "who came here from Brussels," recently said Krischanitz, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
Such architecture stands "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "be proper self-conscious".
In this case, however, the 21st century House is not in the wrong place, because the urbanist happy coincidence has occurred: In the district around Schweizer Garten there is a completely new design "City district at the Main Station" with office and residential houses.
And perhaps there is another happy coincidence: The house of the 21st century could receive support from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunshalle and, as you can hear it, already has one with the city of the neighbourhood at the site of Schweizer Garten.
The road is planning a package for the winter crisis at a millionth.
The road has been drained by a crisis plan to prevent train accidents in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It'll cost millions.
In the winter fight against train accidents and delays, Deutsche Bahn issues more than 70 million euros in the news this year.
The "Bild" news reported in advance with a call for an internal group plan, that it is estimated to be totaled by 2015 with investments of around EUR 300 million.
It is intended to achieve better use of trains and rail networks under extreme wind conditions as well.
It is planned, inter alia, to double the number of internal and external workers per 16,000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and freight stations.
The aim is to remove the starting point for operation and 90% for operation of the required displacements during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Drath Rüdiger Grube warned after meeting at the highest level with the government and industry representatives before train accidents and delays during the winter.
In the last winter, she had a major problem in personal transport, because, among other things, she had a lack of reserve under difficult weather conditions.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for years to be approved by the Stockholm Railway Authority.
In addition, delays in the transport of ICE trains
The route has not been able to do so over the years, and it is likely that ICE's train repairs must be more frequent when one of the ICE trains arrived at Cologne's main station to destroy the repair.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of dollars in the United States
After a break around Chief Joseph Ackermann, there is a new trampoline in the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, it was still in the field of his past in the United States: the Frankfurt institution is paying $145 million in a balance sheet operation (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgages.
The NCUA financial market regulator estimates a number of large banks that the cooperative banks have failed to pay for the purchase of financial products; that the risks are likely to be reduced.
Such papers were lost in the course of the crisis, much to the value and thrown the banks with them into ruin.
"We are satisfied that we could resolve the issue without having to drag the parties to court," spokesperson Deutsche Bank said in New York.
The bank doesn't admit any guilt when it's settled.
It also applies to Citigroup, which committed to paying $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the presence of both monetary institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the United States and assists in bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
NCUA is trying to get a refund for the resulting billions of damage.
Now the final equations are the first of their kind.
The regulator also relied on other large banks, and in summer he complained about JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the suspicious mortgage notes it is called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the American bubble collapsed around the real estate in 2007, it became a number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its thinking.
Even though the incident happened a few years ago, the wind is blowing in the mouth of the banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous complaints to obtain corrections or to raise doubts.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) released the largest wave of complaints.
It is clear to 18 international banks that two state-owned financiers dealing with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's properties in mortgages amounting to about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face the FHFA complaint, which deals with more than US$ 14.2 billion in total from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for "substantial losses" without stating an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with 10 billion
Financial guru Buffett invests potentially in IBM IT.
Since March, he has bought a stock worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, a significant American investor Warren Buffett has always declared that it will not invest in IT and computers, as long-term development of companies is only expected to be difficult to predict.
However, he has now read the commercial reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had already had to understand that IBM was offering services in particular and had computer systems for the IT department of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment in the financial world is considered to be a knight's match.
As a result, it must now be called the mother's horn of IT IBM.
Because Buffett has announced in the US Economic Advertising Station CNBC that since March he has purchased an IBM stock of $10.7 billion.
His Investment Holding Berkshire Hathaway thus became one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about his engagement yet.
He praised the management that was trying to achieve an economic crisis even with the right results.
"You did a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
For a long time, IBM has been investing in luxurious IT services such as the operation of computing centres.
More than 100-year-old computer developer also offers software and advice and efficient computers for companies.
Buffet with technology companies has been more out of line to this day.
He claims to invest only in businesses whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffet was loaded by a truck, by a manufacturer of masculines, or by a manufacturer of machinery.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns around 80 own subsidiaries also shared in a number of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municher Recht.
Mr. 81-year-old took over a small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway in the 60th century and built out of it one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his way of life is modest.
That's why it's for many investors all over the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of making money brought him the nickname "Omaha's Orakel (Omaha's Wizard).
When Buffett's investment became known, the IBM stock stood up before the start of the stock exchange by one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total price of more than $220 billion in stock and is placed with Apple and Microsoft for the most valuable technology companies in the world.
In Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to do it.
Founder Bill Gates is his trusted friend.
The danger is material
Following the discovery of "Bunów in Zwickau", the Turkish media have doubts about the German rule of law.
The news even talks about "blood ideology", which now relives.
The killings of eight small Turkish entrepreneurs and of one Greek in 2000 to 2006 had a legally extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany, fear and anxiety were affected by this report.
Because for many German Turks, the threat that has long been considered dead has returned: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 there has been no comparable violence with the right extremist background.
There was no doubt that there was a xenophobia in Germany.
However, the legally established extremist network reveals the extent to which the dimension cannot be observed long ago.
"Reliving Bloody Ideologies Again?" the titles of the internet release of Turkish news "Haberturk" were changed.
On the contrary, the news "Sabah" emphasises that one of the perpetrators should be a secret police officer for the protection of the constitution and fears that German authorities could also be involved in the right radical barrier.
The Turkish community of Germany responded with a considerable response: It recalled the weekend of silent demonstrations in front of the Brandeburg dam of victims of racist violence.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with the German and Turkish policies, recalled a commemorative act of the 50th anniversary of the German and Turkish recruitment agreements.
In happy colors, a common life was staged - as a history of success.
As a box here, the news of several Turkish media: "Darek Germany to the '50s" is the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, the issue of the letter "Hürriyet" for Germany is not allowed to take place in order to prevent this connection.
"It's starting to smell," is the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes that people who paid taxes and their work have been killed have made an important contribution to the restoration of Germany.
The most critical is the procedure of the police in German internet forums and its late success in the search.
Why did not the German authorities come up long ago to admire the authors after suspected patrols in the right-wing extremistic circles?
Thus many are held at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If the activity continues to be carried out so superficially, the immigrants will have nothing but their own defence and arms."
"It's probably the best self-defense."
"The quality of explanation and proportionality of the entire network depends very heavily on domestic peace in Germany," says "Selen."
Which means, if domestic peace is threatened in Germany, they explain the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the burning place in Solingen is deeply into the memory of the Germans and Turks.
Because no other event has shown to the Turks living here more clearly that there is a major threat here and to the Germans that mistrust and deviation can lead to legal violence
However, the assassinations made Turkey's side more sensitive.
Do not repeat the past mistakes
The Turkish press then criticised the failure of German politics after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit you in Mölln, who survived.
After the burning attack in Solingen, he sent a co-sponsored telegram to the Turkish President, but he had his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then calculated in his speech the fees paid by the Turks.
It's like a person's value is measured according to the height of his tax.
The current Turkish media reports show once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks is in the present state-law arrangement.
In addition to the effort to explain and re-evaluate the right of extreme terrorism in Germany, this time requires open words.
Scandal bank at the Curyško Lake
The most favourable bank of Europe has no residence in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered almost bankruptcy as a financial crisis and from then on from one crisis to another.
Now a German has to compare it.
Then Axel Weber certainly didn't mean it.
Following his sound departure from the head of the Spolk bank, it became known in July that 2013 will take place in almost the same spectacular new job: the President of the Governing Council of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in the career.
Axel Weber was excited publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its new strength and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"The UBS has reached the scene."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villeger and Oswald Grübel."
But it was clear in September that everything would be completely different.
One dealer from UBS in London visited all security systems of the bank and lost approximately EUR 1.7 billion.
The director of the UBS representation Oswald Grübel, not only a distinguished banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the UBS Board of Directors has since been as well as adjourned - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has become known that the Weber bank has been allowed to operate since February 2012.
And the Presidency will take over the Governing Council in May - not only in 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's gonna be hard.
He's not a banker, he's a professor of economics and an emission banker, and he'd definitely need time to work.
We will then take responsibility for the Bank's strategy, which has once again proved that it deserves the title "Bank of Europe's biggest scandals"
Because UBS, however, is huge - up until recently, was the world's largest asset manager - and almost every year from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, will not remain proud of the Swiss bank being saved.
It started as a financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid but also the clever manager of the property is combined with ambitious goals: she also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
Thus, UBS 2007 corrected on one side with $1.6 billion more money from customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she acted as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made sense.
A former banker and later a long-term professor of banking in Zurich Hans Geiger will say, "I always told my students that UBS was a good banker."
"From today's point of view, man asks, "How could I have been so wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, it was first apparent that something in the UBS had gone well.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, the head of the representation, was surprised to see him as a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker.
A few months later, he was wondering why he left.
The investment division of the bank broke subprime-papers and had to save billions.
To stop it, the UBS announced an increase in capital of real 13 billion francs.
That is why it is true that investors have been found, however, to be more involved recently: the transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and the Arab state fund, which was so discreet that man has not even known his name.
But it was just the first shot.
It got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to admit the new billions of losses, the president of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second best paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS became in view of its poor investment in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The Nationalbank has recovered from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for a mandatory variable bond for which it could become a co-founder of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has so large banks in its territory.
Finally, the balance sheet of the 2007 UBS was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see picture).
"We couldn't save UBS once again," says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster hits the second.
For several months now, UBS has capitalised in a tax dispute with America and has shown a willingness to issue data from customers who, as far as possible, have been taxed with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return on unauthorized profits from these transactions, including discounts.
This led to more or less open UBS finding that it helped to reduce tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that had been the life of her capital in the competition for rich customers: a saint of discretion.
After this scandal there was no more Swiss banking secrets than before.
Following the resignation of the head of the representation and the President of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
The bank thus lost its credibility over the course of several months in both central business areas: in investment banking due to poor speculation and in the management of property to help tax fraud.
And just when it calmed down again, just when it was thought that UBS had recovered again, this unfortunate commercial anabasm came here: the only dealer lost 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And it's clear: with risk management in investment banking, it probably still doesn't fit.
"The Adobe case has probably found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, Economist and Finanz Professor of Finance at the Zürich University Banking Institute.
The financial director of the large German bank is also certain: "The UBS problem is that it does not manage risk control."
However, that was exactly the idea of the caution that Swiss bankers have stepped up long ago to become the observers of the world's big assets: no too high a risk, so the security of money - also from this side of the Alpine Republic has increased the world again.
Swiss banks’ vaults have become a symbol of unbreakable trust like Lindt and Sprüngli for especially quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still suitable for the good Swiss private banks - it's just a little bigger.
The place is already classic.
The bank has its main seat in the Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curyš Lake, which is framed by snowcapped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rentals of shops are the highest in Europe.
Clothing like Tiffany's is found here among the Swiss traditional shops like the Sprüngli sugarcane.
The Swiss banks have been established for centuries: from the Nationalbank through the Palast der Credit Suisse to the elite private bank like Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is entered by heavy turning doors.
Inside there are walls covered with marble, there are possible leather chairs, next to the bank's log, a big direction to "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
However, this idea of the Swiss Banks of both Swiss Grand Banks, UBS and Credit Suisse sometimes - have pressed or betrayed, as the head of one small Swiss private bank finds out.
His name would rather not be read in the newspapers, finally closing, like all Swiss bankers, as well as both big banks.
UBS is likely to grow too much, finding out - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Americans have expanded.
The Swiss probably don't have anything to say about it.
"And if they did, they would have adapted to English ways long ago."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Banking that changed the UBS, which led to its first high profit and then loss: no European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
October 15, 2008 was a disaster.
"On Wednesday, the government coalitions of the small seven million countries succeeded in the greatest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros have been approved by politicians to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If they're talking to Swiss bankers, they see a problem in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Grand Banks joined a powerful group.
A bank that was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and it continued to grow.
However, it helped to complement the two different bank predecessors of UBS: one rich but sleeping bank in Zurich with a desire to manage property and poorer, but internationally more closely involved.
The internationalised investment bankers have now come in favour of a lot of money that they could spend on a large roulette.
With this rise, the UBS is linked to two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, head of the UBS and Marcel Ospel group, then president of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Opel were the team of the future," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, humble, who knows a lot about models and statistics and Opel, a man who is driving his feelings around the stomach, which he has developed from banking science to the top."
But Ospel was probably relying on Wuffli at the end.
And at the end, Wuffli probably admitted to making a decision: "I guess he thought his models were real," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, there was a fall of pride.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of the leading workers, on which the group leader Wuffli repeated the same password all the time: Hit Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She mentioned "League Tables", a series documenting the success of the bank of that time.
She was trying to get UBS up there.
A few steps have already happened to her.
In the foreign exchange trade and shares, the games were fully involved.
However, business advisors who were entrusted emphasize one weakness: In international interest trading, in the speech of bankers "Fixed Income", there is probably a great gap behind the largest banks.
UBS has some gaps in American mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, the UBS decided on an adventure that almost became its existence.
Hungry after growth, both the bank itself and its bank-based fund to ensure the risk to US investments of Subprime.
It developed into a powerful machine that transformed valuable paper into American mortgage loans and passed on - but it also kept itself at risk.
Even when the other banks were looking for an exit.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS bought it," says bank expert Geiger.
The size of the euphoria, the depth of the fall.
One manager after the other had to leave when the cleaning attempts were harder than he thought.
The UBS positions have become catapulting seats, and to this day they have fallen apart.
Who's leading the big bank now has almost impossible jobs.
They have to find a strategy for a bank that all close business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: End of investment banking, concentration on property management, return to Swiss roots.
That's how far the bank (not yet) doesn't want to go.
But investment banking is going to kill so hard, it's so clear now.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank of Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italy was understood only as a transitional solution when the bank suddenly broke up with the predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime: He has a long time to run UBS stores, she told the Curys Bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state in the mid-1990s.
3500 spots thick.
But it won't be enough.
UBS needs a visa.
Who's there?
What does he want to make money for?
These are questions that Axel Weber is already handling.
In public, however, she's just saying that she's gonna find her lady in front of her apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the stock market in the United States.
The threatening recession in Europe has saved American investors the courage to start the week.

In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, as reported by the Eurostat Statistical Office.
"We're not an island, we're not dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe is probably not so quick about the recession, and there are other signs of weakness in banks.
The legend of Warren Buffett's investment only confirmed this view: in one CNBC interview, he said it would not be clear if Europe was strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
That's why it's probably too soon to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left the old principle for decades and entered the American technology industry.

Smart crows expand in cities
In many places the caves are filled with "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals cannot be sprayed from the city long ago, said experts.
One of them likes them, friends would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Doors are already part of the city’s image for centuries, yet in some communities there are complaints about uncleanness and noise caused by animals.
So far, there is no way against "problem birds".
The Havranes can't be kicked out of the city, the experts declared the first symposium on the crows in East African Leer.
There, experts from all over the community consulted on possible exits.
Looking for alternatives in cities
The conservationists also removed the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected farms: The use of chemistry in agriculture is likely to destroy traditional areas for life to an increasing extent.
Tracking, growing construction and planting typical trees for nesting birds make life difficult.
The doors are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting couples are, among others, in Westphalia Soestus, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bré and Leer.
There, 2005 called for a controversial project of mass killing of crows in the rural period of negative title.
Critics have marked the capture of animals into the traps for birds and killing the claws especially brutal.
"Normal rejection, fear, nothing brings," found so many urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver from Leer.
The removal of nests by cutting water or planting trees often has adverse consequences, said also environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals retreat, the great colonies flock and divide into other places."
Fear is only a mental exception in hospitals, pensioners or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get away with them."
Without the surrounding area, the city could not be solved, it was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
It is thought that the combination of the removal of animals from sensitive residential areas and their attachment to settle elsewhere.
"Information table instead of chain pills" promoted to this psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of a completely different treatment with animals: "One bite in the face can at last be the best we can stop by ourselves."
In Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg, Mrs Jürgens co-founded the scientific path on which they provide an information table on the life of a highly intelligent Havana full.
The project is in the meantime to accept tourists.
Also at the criticism of the noise of the birds, Mrs Jürgens had her own opinion: "This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Havrani fills not only use the help to reach Pamlska, but even as a help, he will make his tool.
Researchers at Cambridge University have recently tested behavior on four farmed birds as far away as bird intelligence is concerned.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that stones must bring the creation of a structure to reach the larvae.
Without a big train, they knew what size and shape the stone must have to cause the plane collapse.
In the second attempt, the shelled crows had to solve a more delicate problem.
In a silhouette - built war, the researchers placed a small container with a larval mollusk.
They couldn't afford the birds for their own good.
Of course, the researchers put the pieces of the wire in there.
All four of them made a hook, which was used as a blower to catch the bait from the container.
Three of the four full-fledged harbors even managed to get a bite.

Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
Finally, he stood in the center of judgment by Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
After the move against Helder Postigo in the Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbeho and gave the Portuguese a yellow card. (36).
On the contrary, Stark carried out a controversial criminal coup following Fabio Coentraa, which Misimovic certainly changed.
But after the break, the European Vice-President of 2004 explained everything with four trefams.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in 81 minutes.

After the break, it had to be fair to save the place already beaten by the Czech World Class, again reducing the attacker FC Soul (50.).
The branch, shortly before the end, finally explained everything.
At the time, Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul did not exceed Turkey in Zagreb status 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to release his third place in the World Championships in 2002, Croatia must be pleased with its fourth participation in the final round of the European Championships.
Before 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium, Turkey should have a nearly historic start.
Selcuk Inan hit the gun in the seventh minute shot from a distance just a stick, attacker Kazim could not also hang the reflected ball in the brown.
After this terrible second, Croatia took over, but still more control.
They also didn't get the Croatian branch after the interruption.

Ireland was in the beginning of the pace, but it had to wait up to 23 minutes before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.

Massacre at personal level
A powerful new book by Peter Englunda, entitled Beauty and Consolation: The True History of First World Wars (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with such a long list of emerging characters as you get your head.
One advice on how to behave at this time: Carefully remove this page and make a deposit box.
With all the people you will get to know Mr. Englunda very well and this list will serve you as a navigation - as a mayk - at moments when you will feel as much confused and lost as men and women in the story.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also a new job at the Swedish Academy, which grants the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author describes it himself, quite politely, as "antihistoric work".
It contains a number of well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, but it is almost lacking in ambassadors, energetic journalists and discussions on tactics and equipment.
It is not as much a book as a book about what happened, explains the author as "the book about what it was". It deals mainly with " feelings, perceptions, experiences and moods".
"Breath and sorrow" combines the war experiences of 20 more less Tuttic men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to after the horrors, doctors, rescue drivers and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose their lives, get mad or die.
Their lives are like flames of candles burning in the church - new ones are added to the confusion of fate while others are extinguished.
Mr. Engunda's book is different from classical historical novels.
He manages the idea that the first world war was just a horrendous war on the Western front.
The "Beautiful and Enormous" explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with the falling nests of nests, must spend Christmas in the shadow of pyramids or encounter the presence of tes-tse flies.
It's almost a very exciting reading from the beginning.
The war will devour people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, with a shooting job.
When you start shooting at work in the distance and you are a woman who is at home with your children, will you run away or stay?
Who's actually getting close?
Nearly no one understands what's going on, even why the whole war was fought.
"Vakuum arising from lack of facts," said Mr. Englund, "was filled with ghosts, suspicions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and fairy tales."
"Breath and sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmrough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are everywhere taken from biographies, letters, and other material that has already been published.
The descriptions of their lives may sound frightening and repulsive, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details, they are completely alive and credible.
Many of them agree on working with him and settling with him.
In the story of the German student, the author says, "The rewards, the same ones everywhere."
"A substitute for coffee, like clay, rubber imitation, paper envelopes, wooden buttons."
He goes further and describes food replacements in Germany.
It refers to "mass made from liquefied rice cooked in spoof fat (and supplemented by fake bone from wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potatoes, boots with wooden sticks".
It refers to the existence of "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of parks and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds in himself an inner flood of savagery and brutality, which proclaims the war: "At last you will understand that this is the human nature. Never sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or good books and pretend that this mask represents civilization and that behind this clumsy I don't hide any barbarians."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he is most likely to die soon, and no one will ever notice, but to grieve.
"If a person finally addresses the sacrifice, he would at least wait for it to happen in front of the eyes of the grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, it seems like a "criminal, which he secretly hangs."
Further notes concern the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new threats.
"The conflict with the further economic competition and competition," says Mr. Englund, "was a war between factories."
He caught what he says "the new kind of beast of the coming century: a definite and ideologically imperishable mass killer in a dress cut in peace that carries out its bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People act totally unexpected, subtly dealing with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes the soldiers who were deliberately trying to catch some sexually transmitted disease to avoid service on the front.
"The most difficult example of this behavior was the trade with gonococcal crap that soldiers bought and beat their genitals in the hope that they would end up in the hospital," she writes.
"The most cunning of all have thrown him into the eye, which has often blinded him to the end of life."
In this Swedish translation from Peter Gravese, Mr. Engunda is fresh, but it is not obvious, which is very appropriate for his human theme.
In the tens of small outputs, he grasps the way in which the war "has disbanded completely insurmountable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders have to fight.
The best books on the First World War worked with signs rather than with a complex story, such as "First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussella or the Romans as "On the West Front Peace" by Eric Marie Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most shocking marriage that there are no periods in popular scientific literature.
I won't betray him to you, though.
But you'll look like the author suddenly jumped out of the book, pulled out a page from the list of heroes out of his hand and burned it.
After the previous mistake this time for a minute exactly scheduled time
Hundreds of policemen took part in it, some in the bays used in street trouble.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park should be almost empty at that time.
No one knew about the action except for a few high-ranking officers, and the others were first told that it was a practice.
In front of the event, police commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face in the operation.
Cases of recent weeks should not be repeated when, for example, the use of pepper sprays against demonstrators was used, which violated the rules of the department and the wave of public sympathy was transferred to the side of the squatters.
That was why a police operation aimed at clearing Zuccotti Park from demonstrators was launched after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders allowed themselves to be inspired by operations carried out in other cities.
Massive exercises for behaviour in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island section, which was prepared for action in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have enhanced so-called peace-repression training - counter-terrorist measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of police - focusing on the city part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" by someone who had originally been explained as "training".
"I know a few policemen who were also invited to this event, and certainly no one told them that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only if he remained anonymous.
"The fact that he's going to Zuccotti Park, they only knew the highest position of the members of the department."
One reason for hiding was a lesson that the city had learned once.
On 14 October, the city representatives had to clean up the park, but then they stopped from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they moved them to the park before the start of the operation.
The internal actions were attended by police officers from various units, including group of attackers from all over the area - dozens of policemen who are usually used to strengthen the quarter with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day in the park he was coming and leaving a large crowd of people again, so one hour at night was the ideal time for action to start.
"It was appropriate to carry it out at a time when it would be the least people in the park," he said.
Before the units went out, they were stationed on the street of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge bridge, freight units with cloud lamps and amplifications.
The light and recorded message from the amplifications of many demonstrators scared.
When members of the order units entered the park in their blue winds, many demonstrators packed their things and left.
The police say that until 1:45 in the morning, she didn't touch a single state, which she wanted to give the demonstrators time to pack things up.
Other teams of police were watched as they gathered on the park's edge so they could get into it if there was a need to do some arrest.
The reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman of the police department, claimed it was so safe for them.
Many reporters, however, maintain the view that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her units in action, and in addition, some police officers were rude to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that the TV stations on the Church Street leading along the western border of the park could film without any problems.
The police took a western course and went through a thick mix of personal protesting things, including luggage and Igelite bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the hygienic department, who immediately collected everything that was left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were removed from the park. Documentary imaging material appeared on the Internet a moment later.
The most vulnerable group of demonstrators retreated to the vicinity of the kitchen in their camp, which lay near the center of the park.
Some of them created a spell, and the police started their methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp joined each other.
And two people joined the tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Members of emergency services were called to cut the locks.
Until 3:30 in the morning there was no arrest, Mr. Kelly announced.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, it sounded like a police statement.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests took place on the basis of "organisation of alertness and arrest resistance," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, was the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation also took part in Phil T. Pulaski, chief of detectives in the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he didn't share in operating," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it would be necessary to call her.
On Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, there were tarsiers.
From these places the police have developed a protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, policemen, many of whom were equipped with shields, were seen pushing people further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the north border.
The most savage events of the night have been going south of the park.
About five o'clock in the morning, one protestant was seen south of Pine Street, as he jumped to the police station, and several others who fired air from the tires of police supplies.
At one point, a piece of crossbow flew out of the dove.
One police officer and one protestant were hospitalized at the end of the operation.
The Association of Assistant Workers will sue the city for release
The committees representing hundreds of school auxiliary workers, who lost their jobs last month, plan to sue the city on Wednesday. They claim that release was not necessary and also discrimination was due to the disproportionate impact on schools visited by poor students.
The Court is likely to be the last option left to the District Council 37 committees in their efforts to reverse the decision on release.
On 7 October, six seven hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees, who were among the highest paid city employees, lost their jobs. Their release was described as the city's payout because last year they were unable to access the health care fund managed by a staff member who wanted to get a hole in the budget.
The city's representatives categorically rejected this charge.
At the meeting of the City Council, held last month, the Minister of Education Dennis M. Walcott said that the discharge was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately checked that there was no specific discussion on the release of auxiliary workers in the budget.
Representatives of the District Council 37 announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue her. On Wednesday, they allow a press conference where they will formally report the complaint to the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education will be accused in the process, while the complaining party will have eight dismissed workers, all of whom are African Americans or Hispanic, as well as most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson for the legal department of the city, said that the city had not yet seen the complaint, and that is why he would not speak up for individual charges.
According to the draft complaint that the New York Times was able to obtain, the committees focused on the number of missing people in poor parts of the city, which they wanted to support their allegations of unfair conduct. Therefore, they maintain the view that poor schools have become more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funding.
They point out that while schools in the Staten Island part did not escape at all and only at least in the Upper East Side part, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants were fired and 46 assistants were released in District 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
He recalls that in the school of Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, although it is about a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The complaint says: "It is not about a neighborhood full of oral parents who can raise funds to balance the budget deficit."
The public school budget for 36 was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed its way of calculating bonus finance for every registered poor student.
In addition, the Committees claim that the directors of secondary schools could be confused by the way in which a document approving the release of parents’ coordinators was written.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the event, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is more often used to describe the teacher's movement from the school's payroll to the accessible workers' database, whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parents' coordinators were released," the complaint is quoted as saying, "and not only moved to the database to the position of available workers."
The mission is at the end, Congress is ready to accept agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, the Republicans and Democrats at the Congress seem to agree on something regarding the rise in Libya.
Before this happened, however, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time, the ruling dictator Muammar Kaddafi had to be arrested and killed and the United States units' participation ended.
On Tuesday, the Commission on International Relations of the Senate will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate the Libyans on their successful rise to the American units for "statistics".
"By this declaration we want to assess the courage of the Libyans who started rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
The above words may seem innocent, but there was no debate on Libya until it was easy.
During the years, the legislators of both sides held an ongoing dialogue with the White House on the amendment of a series of declarations to approve or reject the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented resolutions allowing limited use of the US armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in November because of the different views of both political parties, so it was never voted on in the Senate.
However, on the 10th day when this proposal was rejected in November, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop financing US operations in Libya.
Thus the US mission in Libya literally felt in legislative cleansing - Congress criticised the way President Obama manages the mission, but his members obviously did not do so much to stop supporting him in his work.
The importance of the convention was finally preceded by other events.
The rebels in August won Tripoli, and October 20th was killed by Kaddafi.
The mission then officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for International Relations, in its declaration, " congratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and a wonderful attitude which they have committed to freeing their people" and "congratulating the men and women of the United States armed forces and their allies who have engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for their extraordinary status and professionalism."
The declaration also "confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irrevocable transition to democracy in Libya."
Is there a new proposal for full support from the Commission for international relations, or will the legislators be once again divided into two halfs, as was the case with the approval of the red proposal?
Against the latest version, Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the representative of the Republican Party, was appointed by the Commission.
Lugar's speaker said Monday that he had not seen the final version of the new proposal yet.
In November this week, there will be a vote on an addendum to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, followed by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution on the budget or other subject to be voted on by the whole of November or the Senate.
For the time being, other legislators have not yet been able to push their proposals to the vote on their own.
Goodlatt's proposal is only one of 68 additions to the constitution, which were presented at the Congress and touched on the wide range of themes.
Some of them were the same -- the proposal presented to the House and the Senate -- and others are just minor exchanges of others.
Only 15 versions of the balance sheet and other versions of the budget can be found in Snowford, which would like to "regulate federal expenditure".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters - especially the starters of Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can be covered by their "authority".
The opinion on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, called for the addition to the balanced budget to be voted on by the Sniemovna and the Senate.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of an unconditional declaration to support the development of such an addition.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss the number of periods in which members of the Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be held by the President.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a whole range of supplements that would guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The long-term proposal remains an addendum banning the marriage of couples of the same sex and an addendum banning the burning of the flag of the State.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if two thirds of the States oppose them.
Although members of the Congress seem to be very active in designing various additives, compared with previous years, they do not significantly expel the average.
At the 111th Congress, 77 additionals were offered, while at the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even pales in comparison with the early 1990s, when, according to the statistics of the Senate, members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than the current policy.
The last addition added - 27th addition - was ratified in 1992, but actually the Congress was proposed in 1789.
"Blowed, but not defeated," said Gifford in his first television interview from the shooting
Ten months after she was immediately struck by a gun at a public meeting with the voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on the national television on Monday evening, sang a song from the Broadway Show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and announced that more than a return to Congress is worth healing.
Giffords appeared in the "20/20" series at the ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was to see that the creation of seeds was still causing problems and needed help in the process.
The whole series documented her difficulty in reconvalence, which was necessary for the injury of a bullet caused by a knife that struck her head in the front, pierced her left half of her brain, and came out of her head.
Three months ago, she suddenly returned to the Snowfall to participate triumphantly in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview from the ice shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing his recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, she answered four decades old Giffords, "Very well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hourly special part of the series "20/20", which was broadcast in the evening of the release of this couple's new book, entitled "Gabby: Story of Courage and Hope".
The Special was monitoring the entire reconvalence of Gifford from the 8th of January.
On the videos that Kelly made during the first week, it's seeing Giffords in a hospital bed with a hairy head and a long scar across the forehead.
While her husband is encouraging her, he can't do more than just lift one or two fingers at that time.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and the therapist teaches her how to perform simple activities.
A headache.
Disposal of the lips.
And then, her first word, "What."
During a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "toast", when changes were needed in his breakfast.
The video released by the ABC station shows that the critical role for the recovery of Gifford's music: The congressman sings on them together with the therapist on the song "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During the conversation with Gifford, who spends two hours a day on therapy, Sawyer said he didn't remember anything from the day he got shot.
Her husband said that the Giffords read news articles about the shooting by March 12th, when she first asked him who was the sixth woman who was killed during the incident.
From the shooting, the suspect Jared Lee Loughner is detained in a prison in Missouri, where under the influence of violent medications waits for trial.
"Many people died," said Gifford Sawyer.
"Truthful, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer said that in one moment his wife declared "I've lost."
"So I immediately told her, Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly described.
"You've just got a load.
But you can do it, you can get back together and you'll be even stronger than you've ever been."
Military units meet with more compassion than with respect
This event was a gala night on Wall Street, which cost millions of dollars for war veterans in New York, who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, sailors, sailors and sailors ran around him.
A well - dressed crowd rose up and excitedly shouted.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who arranged spring benefits.
On the evening of the celebration, the then chairman of the board of chiefs was also present, and in addition to him, Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of the military units in a different way.
"All were represented as poor," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought so well.
I know you do.
But what I saw was not respect.
Thus, the very opposite impressions just illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often balanced, sometimes praising the American public.
The army is clearly included in the praise for its victims.
But these praise stands for something, the soldiers say.
The public is becoming more and more like an individual in uniform regretting.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and was soon leaving Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to make us a part of the unhappy souls."
This theme is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or to show their relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger they had to face when returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most words of pity are conveyed in silence and in private among war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Canciano returned from the battles where they served as members of the maritime forces, their father warned them that people outside the army would look at their service from two angles.
From the perspective of some, they will feel respect and admiration because they defeated enemy uprisings and visited exotic sites.
In other words, he's going to turn his head around if "he doesn't hide himself under the surface of an evil, violent veteran," said Cancian, who took part in the fights in Iraq and when he returned he took the place in Washington in the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people who had been interviewing him were unintelligible about whether he could cope with the stress associated with the work in Washington as soon as he returned from the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian instructed his sons.
The army's concern is partly driven by American greed for war.
The success of the battlefield is only a few times in recognition in a country that has little knowledge of its own army and in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan finds only little of its own prosperity.
"As a nation we no longer regard military hero as usual for World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the U.S. units in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in the arms.
Soldiers are named for the number of actions they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or for the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing increasing pressure to fight violence
This week it will decide whether to initiate a trial of 28 women and men against the army due to alleged inaction in the event of rape.
If not, hundreds of other proposers are prepared to submit a complaint.
The first class of soldiers Elizabeth Lyman was on the night she was allegedly raped by her army colleague for 25 years and was in the 11th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008 and she went to the embassy at Miramar airport north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she hit her male companion with 12 beer box.
He asked her if she could join her so that they could have a little drink in her room.
"In my head there was a bright light," Lyman described.
But the Texas family totally ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"She's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
He claims that only a few minutes after they entered her room, her husband went to her, threw her into bed and raped her.
This week, November 18th, Lymanov and 27 other standing or former members of the army will be waiting for the verdict of a hearing that could have a historical impact. This will be played in Arlington in Virginia and will be discussed in it as to whether charges against former defence minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought before the court.
The charge states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the fight against the spread of military violence, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
During the following months, however, their number grew to 28-25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army, and the army failed to investigate, punish, and any charge of justice after informing them of these effects.
Burke says he's going after the highest military commanders, because the problem is starting with them.
"The army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to introduce measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that since February she has contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of whom could become part of the other claims submitted in the future.
Her strategy: More than collecting all the charges on this case - all the eggs in one basket, as she says herself - will file complaints in several different cases if pressure is not to subside.
The Defence Department team is led by the United States State Representatives Neil MacBride, who, together with his colleagues, urged the case to be rejected.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek detail the defence strategy - in principle, it is that the present or former soldiers cannot sue the army for the injury suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the 1950 Supreme Court regulation, the Federal Government is not responsible for the injury suffered by soldiers in active service.
"Punishable injuries concern the military services of the plaintiff," the document says.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in the battle, it is only a matter of speaking: in modern wars it is only difficult to find a clearly defined front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women's soldiers played the most important role, especially in the area of communication with civil women in the war zone.
As a result, 150 female soldiers fell among these wars - two thirds of them directly in battle.
It's time for modernization in the army, too, explains Burke.
She's not alone in her fight, except for three other legal representatives.
At Yale Law School, visitors to the Veteran Seminar on Legal Services prepare a complaint at the four main military academy for the alleged development of an atmosphere that promotes hatred for women.
Regardless of the inconvenient organisation of the American Vietnamese veterans, it collects the basis for its anti-military complaint. This complaint focuses on the diagnosis of "injury of personality", which was allegedly found in rape victims to have the army shut down for their release - according to activists such as Anu Bhagvati, who belong to a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, is a very common practice.
In December, her group had already filed a complaint against the state organisation for dealing with veterans, who was accused of discriminatory practices, which should have come to the processing of requests for assistance from those who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
In Congress, nine separate proposals were presented, which were presented by a group of senators and Members of the two political parties and proposed a whole range of corrective measures.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Solution of Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3,158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases and, according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this figure corresponds to about 13.5% of the estimated number of 19,000 incidents that occurred in the year in question.
The report issued in March also covers the level of criminal harassment of suspects: in 2010, 20 per cent of cases reported in the army - half against the civil justice system.
In the case of Deputy Burke, the complainants describe attacks only as the first of the whole series of traumas.
For example, Lyman's first-class army reported alleged rape of the military police not an hour after it was supposed to come to him.
During the night, she said she was asked to repeat the details of her rape to the police, doctors and commanders eleven times.
She conducted all the investigations necessary for the purpose of rape and found the blood of the attacker in her bed - from the wound she had done on the guard.
About six months later, in April 2009, Lyman graduated from the hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions about whether she loved her friend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned who as witnesses of reputation spoke for the sake of the alleged offender who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day when judgment was issued," Lyman says.
"I felt like I was having a baby right there - screaming out of courtroom."
"They put me on a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "It wasn't his judgment. It was mine."
Lymans were ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder that marked her as unfit for service.
In January 2010, the army was released without respect and therefore without claim.
Whether Lyman's case and the other plaintiffs move to another stage or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University.
However, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to proceed to further stages of discussion."
However, there is a doctrine that has been criticised since the first time that the light of the world has been seen.
I'm the lifetime critic of the Phares Doctrine doctrine.
The army is several decades behind, because their duties do not allow them to comply with the same level of motivational incentives and deterrents.
He adds, "The odds are hard on them... but it's important for them to try."
Only when good people are willing to fight will change.
If the hearing is not decided in their favour, Burkevoa, the plaintiff, gathers hundreds of other persons who are prepared to file a complaint and starts working on other cases relating to this subject.
"We will not stop fighting the army on this issue from where the reform is not coming," he says.
Or until we die, according to what comes first.
The walls have eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new face of legal extremism in Europe, he was only another young man who presented his anti-violence opinions on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murder warrant, followed by 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time in computer preparation, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting legal groups on social networks.
After this year's tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how can I find them?
Easy - just go out on Facebook.
"We realized that getting them is not really that hard," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British research team dealing with European digital populism.
The collection of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, Bartlett says it was enough for scientists to simply use advertising on the pages and, thanks to their complete accuracy, they have identified the population group they are looking for - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe has found half a million right-wing fans, focusing on them and sending them advertisements, but instead of calling them into new groups or offering them some diet products, asked them to fill in the questionnaire, which raised questions about their level of education, their relationship with violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues succeeded in obtaining results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different rights groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"It's a completely new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online rights groups are all young men who promote the growing degree of mobility.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism even with offline activism are smarter, more democratic and less violent than those who remain hidden behind the screen."
The DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use these pages to study everything, from health problems to social trends covering status updates, contributions to breath and pressed "I like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides on average three different data, which from this social network literally makes "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic works, whose name is Facebook, has increased against the state five years ago by almost 800%.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"It's been paid that once you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British nation, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to a party where you'd never be left," Bartlett says.
"This is all Facebook - you're just going straight to it."
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid social and health problems.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who had broken up their drunken performances on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who had been silent about this topic.
Morenová proposes that students' graders monitor the site and come with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
"The problem cannot be solved unless you can diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We've found a way to identify dangerous children that we wouldn't have a chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly polls the data of its users.
The information team developed statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, electoral participation in 2010 and the nation's satisfaction rate (mainly through the use of the information they had access to - internet freedom advocates for a long time that the website should access its information treasure to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to provide the site with your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clear rules on how to collect data offline. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I didn't think most of the users would be able to look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist in London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using public facebook walls of his students.
"If it was about them, they took it as if information were just between them and their friends."
The following is also a question of methodology.
Even when researching offline, there is no guarantee that the subject is absolutely honest.
There is no way on Facebook to verify how much information on the profile and contributions on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two very different things," explains Selwyn.
That is why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, believes that the pen and pen still remain the best possible tool to be used in research.
"When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Community research should be about society and social activities - and the hell many social activities are still taking place offline."
"Frozen and Nelidsky": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public appeal
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who admitted to committing two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, during his first public hearing in Oslo, described himself as a fighter of "defense".
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian temple knights," he declared before the court where 500 people gathered.
"I respect the opposition to the court because your mandate has been granted by organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I admit no guilt."
Judge Torkiel Nesheim Breivika interrupted during this monologue because "he didn't want to give Breivik an opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a speech with him, at the end of the hearing to address his victims.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from any contact with the media for 4 minutes, and announced that the authorities would have complete control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives and survivors.
Some have come to hope that they will be able to look into Breivik's eyes, others to make sure he's held firmly under the castle.
All of them took part in moving the case to a rapid closure.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and indiscriminate," the NRC commentator told one of the survivors of the attack.
"It wasn't nice, but I can say to myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I moved on a little bit further."
Breivik, in the dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the entire period. On arrival and going to the building without difficulty looking at the present journalists and survivors in the eyes.
Despite Brevik's bizarre idea that he's part of the larger "response" movement, the judge found that he's not crazy, and noted that there's no evidence that he's got a partner.
For someone it can be comforting that the attacks of June 22 seemed to be the work of a single extremist and not of a group of radicals.
This, however, does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I wish she'd look like a creature, but it's not," said one of the victims.
"If so, it would be much easier."
7 lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie shooting this week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of the people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear and chose him as the greatest modern inventor of his genius.
For all fans of Apple's recently reopened Job's interview, which was designed for a special film that was directed to film this week, the fact that his creative mind completely understood the commercial processes and workflows behind his products will be for all fans of Apple.
He was an amazing designer, a snipe and a self-promoting hippie member, but also a pedant organizer and a man, who every detail ships in the smallest detail - believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "the idea that a truly great idea is 90 percent of their work... [but] between an excellent idea and an excellent result product is still a long way to go."
In 1995 Bob Cringely worked on a TV series of Triumf computer crazys that discussed the creation of personal computers. During the film, he played a unique, more than an hour conversation.
At that time it had been ten years since Jobs was forced to abandon Apple, and he had full hands working with his new computer company NeXT, and he impatiently saw how the general public would accept the Internet.
In the TV series, only a short part of the entire Kringely interview was finally used and the original copies of the interview were betrayed that they were lost in the transport.
Shortly after Job’s death, however, VHS copies were found in the director’s garage.
Just this material, slightly cut, forms the basis of a 68-minute image of Steve Jobs: Lost interview, which leads to selected movies this Wednesday and Thursday.
To someone who has expressed his/her unwillingness to provide further talks, here Jobs is acting surprisingly excitedly that he can talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the conversation, a further pause between the question and the answer will take place - 10 to 15 seconds of thought when it is to see how Job’s answer is perfectly thought out to be as loud as possible and clear as possible.
There are also moments when Job’s perfectionism emerges from the surface, when Cingely’s questions act impatiently and move him to get to more important issues and topics more quickly.
The interview was conducted even before the time of Pixar, iPod or iPhone and there are terrible prophetic thoughts in it, when Jobs values what other companies are doing well and badly, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read Job’s postmortem assessment of his career, but on Job, which we see here as a sleeper in the bloom of his genius, there is something raw and inspiring.
He has his own vision here of how things could and should look.
It didn't take long, and after he expressed his thoughts, he also started to put them in practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to drive the company:
"During the years of business, I always asked myself, "Why do you do this?" And the answer was always the same: Well, that's how it's done."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing, never thinking about things about business.
I found out.
Jobs continues to describe his efforts to simplify accounting in Apple.
He was completely confused by the way the costs were recorded - often started by writing "standard costs", he could only think about their height. At that time he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that ensured that the commercial costs could be determined within a minute.
How he put a barbecue on the pope:
Jobs remembers the "Modru box", which he made with Steve Wozniak - devices that enabled people to get effectively into the telephone company and call anywhere in the world for free.
It was already written in the past, but Job’s enthusiasm when describing the Blue Box as a tool of power is virtually contagious.
They tell how the Vozniak device was tested using the pay phone and during the call they were allowed to switch from one AT&T network to another while using the largest number of satellites.
"At least half a dozen times we got so crowded around the world, so when we called on the pay phone, it came back a minute later from the second phone at the door," laughs Jobs.
"We were young and we found out that we could draw up ourselves a thing that is capable of driving infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."
The two of us made a small thing that could have managed to control much more of the work - it was an incredible experience, and I think it would never have brought Apple up without it.
Jobs continues a description of the joke that was almost finished with Wozniak. By means of the blue box in the middle of the night, they called to the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the pope, and they were best placed to be Henry Kissinger.
They were gradually summoned to the position of members of the Catholic Church to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they woke up to the phone and the pope himself, the two of them burst and sat down.
How he fell in love with technology (and called Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and searched for spare parts to build a perimeter, he found a phone number on Bill Hewlett and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had a secured summer brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I knew at the time, and it formed my view of what such a company is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited a firm research lab in Palo Alto where he saw "the first table computer that was ever made".
He was big as a suitcase, had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him right now.
As a teenager in HP, I acted higher and higher, flaked around the computer and started writing programs for him.
How innovation comes about:
In a number of jobs during the interview, they talk about how they come up with new products.
In the beginning of his career, when he sold a couple of boards with flat connections, one customer asked him to put the whole computer together for him.
He had only 30 paid days available during which he had to devise, detonate and add the finished equipment.
When he was in Apple later, he recalls the problems they faced when developing a computer mouse:
"I remember how we had a pretty wild fight... screaming at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300], when I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer."
About ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How a big company comes up with a breath:
Long before he led Apple’s resurrection, Jobs proselytically predicted that many industrial leaders in his vision would collapse and lose their market share.
"Let's say you're working with IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copies or printers, so what's next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so society can no longer be more successful.
At this point, there is already a government holiday and marketing, so companies are running people who are concerned about this, while people who are concerned about their own products are being raised from the decision-making process.
The technological genius, which has led the company to its unbreakable position, is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skills and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
She could have been ten times bigger than she was, she could have been Microsoft for the 1990s...
Instead of winning, however, they won the prize.
How to take innovation as an art form:
"There is still a long journey and a lot of work between a great idea and a great result product... and how that great idea develops, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to enter into a whole series of compromises - certain things simply do not make you do electronics, glass, robots or factory.
You have to keep in mind 5,000 things - different concepts - and build them together...
Finally, it depends on taste - you try to think about the best things mankind has ever created, and in a certain way you try to make them reflect on what you do yourself.
Picasso said good artists were copying, but the best artists were stealing.
I've never been ashamed to break up the best ideas.
Macintosh's company was so wonderful and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and the best computer experts in the world at the same time.
Without computers and new technologies, they could do amazing things in completely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with the defense of the health care law at the time when their case was handled by the court
On the day that the Supreme Court sat behind the closed doors to discuss a political controversial question, whether to accept opposition to the law on health care of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended the celebration dinner sponsored by the legal firm, which will participate before the court.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges were present to discuss the proposed proposals.
One of the cases considered was a complaint filed by 26 states questioning the radical reprocessing of medical care, which was approved last year by Congress - a law that mobilized conservative activists worldwide.
In March, however, a 5.5-hour debate is expected, which will further develop the presidential elections planned for 2012 and will be in full circulation.
A lawyer standing before the court who will try to reject the law will be most likely to be Paul Clement, who served as the Attorney General of the United States for the George W. Bush government.
Clement's legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinners of the Federalist Society, which has been defending conservative legal principles for years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations of questionable laws, the so-called National Federation of Independent Entrepreneurship.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which they are in the process of a huge financial asset.
The dinner was held at the Washington Hotel several hours after the court hearing on the subject of the case.
She also attended, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of the Republicans in the Senate, and confirmed support for the Health Care Act.
And the guest's introduction?
It's nothing new: These two judges with the Federalist Society's action group have been participating for years.
And it certainly isn't about anything that would be contrary to ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct which are subject to lower federal courts.
However, if this were not the case, their conduct would certainly fall under principle C4, which says that "the judge may participate in actions which are directly related and other organisations for the purpose of obtaining financial resources, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honest guest, nor be included in the programme of action."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomase with two law enforcement companies in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in this case, was rich enough to alarm activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and negligence against the code of conduct is contrary to the assertion by several judges that the Supreme Court is acting in accordance with the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause.
"The judges drank and ate for social benefits together with the legal representatives who are waiting for their case to be discussed before the court."
Their presence and assistance in obtaining financial resources through this action undermines their feet with any claim of non-violence, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas pointed out to their critics only a lack of understanding and showed them that they too combine their judicial obligations without problems with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas Ginni's wife is a highly established conservative activist.
In addition, conservatives claim that the ethical problem is mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the Attorney General for President Obama's Government when the first opposition to the law appeared before the court.
The Kagan critics pressured her to refuse to participate in the case, claiming that she was fighting for the law as much as she could now be unsatisfied.
Kagan didn't mean she was going to resign.
Boeing has received a record order for flow aircraft worth USD 18 billion
Aerolinks Emirates orders 50 two-way Boeing 777 with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six flights Boeing Dreamliner to Aman Air Airlines, for which it charges more than USD 1 billion.
When a company receives an order for 50 pieces of its products, most of them have no reason to celebrate.
However, if the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. and the price of these 50-tons makes a total of USD 18 billion, it's something else.
The same important report is also from where Boeing received the order: Middle East, increasing the gold task for future aircraft orders.
According to the forecasts issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 million in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order in history about the dollar values for commercial aircraft - 50 double-way Boeing 777.
The Sentinel contract came from the Emirates airlines in Dubai.
Boeing at the 2011 Dubai Air Show fair announced that airlines have the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, which would result in the total value of the contracts coming to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air airlines ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six flights exceeds USD 1 billion.
"It's an excellent report for the whole company Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
A lot of airlines in the Middle East belong to the more so-called oil nations.
This means that they have not only the money to pay for aircraft, but the increase in fuel prices - most of which are harmful airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive because the country itself earns oil at higher prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines that could terminate or postpone aircraft orders due to an increase in fuel prices, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The Emirates airline contract confirms Boeing’s leading position on the market with a wide-ranging aircraft and brings Airbus SAS to the narrow company, which wanted to try to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus’ representatives have announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, which is the direct competitor of 777-300ER, will be cancelled.
The drop was due to the customer's demand for more useful aircraft load and flow, so the manufacturer took time to allow the machine to add more power to the engine.
Boeing Co's share price rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
The Mexican President's sister was defeated, according to everything, in the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of PRI, was helped by drug dealers in honor of the governor's throne.
It seems that Felipe Calderon's sister lost her post in the violent state elections in Michoacán. On Monday, she announced that one of her opponents helped drug dealers to win.
The preliminary results contributed to the governing elections of the Western state of Faust Valley by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The involvement of members of organised crime in the entire electoral process and especially in yesterday's elections is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a Sunday's radio interview.
"They threatened our candidates, the members of the public opinion study group... they were entertaining elections, building roadblocks... and letting people vote for the PRI order.
PRI ruled in Mexico for seven decades until the year 2000 when the Presidency came.
However, planning a quick return to power and victory in the elections in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who led the day before the elections, only very closely.
Calderon, a candidate for the Conservative side of his brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Valleyon as a winner.
The third was made up of Silvano Aureolis, a left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who has so far ruled the governing authority. For the party that has been disbanded and badly persecuted, the presidential election in 2012 is a very unfortunate loss.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the capital of the state on behalf of Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug dealers and offers other candidates for recognition of the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
This is the home state of President Calderon, and it was in Michoacán in December 2006 that a military fight against traitors began.
However, the violence continued.
The PAN mayor, the mayor of Luisa Marie Calderon, was killed just a week ago and many of the candidates for the election were out of fear.
However, whatever the outcome of the elections in Michoacán looks like for the PRI side, winning the side will help to get a new impulse.
The expected PR representative in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Neito, from Washington Valley congratulated him and said, "I think this victory might be very encouraging in view of the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from its serious debt crisis, otherwise it could lead to a global decline in the world economy, which would have a negative impact on the growth of the economy in Asia.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the ADB Bank, based in Manila, said that the fastest two growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help quickly recover the currency block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the states of the Bric Group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were following all European difficulties "too unresolved" and declared that Asian financial assistance in combination with European leadership and resources would help to bring about the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in it together."
"So it is appropriate for anyone who could help Europe from the crisis," said the Financial Times during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but she's definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been experiencing a serious debt crisis for several months.
In recent days, Italy's lending costs have been dangerously rising and the Italian and Greek government's presidents have stepped down.
The growing debt crisis in Europe was alarmed by the fact that the global economy could get back into recession and the call for a new emerging leading economies to join and help the Eurozone find solutions.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be directed through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union's Financial Assistance Fund, the European Financial Stability Institute - would provide Asian partners with greater negotiation opportunities.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do what it can," to help the Eurozone, because its own economy now suffers from a decrease in exports and a decrease in the flow of foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an alternative, it's an empty fact, because otherwise we could find a job for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies, such as the Indians, have nothing to do with European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult politically to explain aid to Europe for 1.2 billion people in India, when 800 million of them live from $2 or less per day.
"One could find that the Greeks go to retirement in the 50s and enjoy their vacations on the beaches, which would be hard to explain," he noted.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian resources should be used to maintain good wages for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and lost sectors such as rail transport.
Mr. Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis threatens "dangerous dominant effect".
The Bank's forecast that between 2011/2012, 7.5% of economic growth in Asia is now facing "risk of decline" due to European threats.
He stated that vulnerable developing markets must create "unforeseeable spending plans" to protect themselves from the decline and significant capital flow from their economies.
Warnings from the Pentagon regarding possible damage to the area of defence
The Minister of Defence Leon Panetta, on Monday at Congress, gave a thorough presentation when warning that tearing automatic cuts in the budget could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction beginning in the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to do so by reducing the budget by USD 450 billion over the next ten years, but it is now worried about a further USD 600 billion reduction if the Congress is unable to conclude an agreement on expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be destructive for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress' inability to reach a budget agreement and hence the so-called suspension would cause 23% of the breakdown and the suspension of many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this unbiased way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy only three quarters of the building or ship. Furthermore, it could cause serious damage to other modernisation efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also have to separate many of our civil servants, and since the reduction is so fast, we will also have to send almost certainly civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the targets."
"These changes can poison the faith of those who take care of our army and seriously damage its readiness."
In the end, they're touching and fighting units, Panetta announced.
"Although the accounts for the financing of possible war operations in the sea will not be directly affected, the latter will be adversely affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contractual staff, which will result in delays in agreements that support the war effort of our people."
"There will be a reduction in the situation of paid employees, which will also result in delayed payments to suppliers and the consequent disruption of legal and political support."
Both senators of Panett wrote to him ten days ago and asked him for details of the possible impact on the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of the situation in the Ministry of Defence could cause a rapid deterioration of the view of the United States as a global military power."
"We are strictly against this hard measure," the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published the Panett's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we could live with, and we definitely don't want to sign it."
"The planned flaws are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It will only be seen whether Panetta's letter and fresh warning will increase the pressure on Congress to approve the budget and strengthen the voices calling for the release of the Pentagon from the list of restricted areas.
Panetta has recently been more open in the discussions on possible flaws, although he himself went to his high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience with the approval of the budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew that he was going to be left in the dark fight.
At the press conference a minute of the week, the Minister of Defence pointed out a brief picture of what his resort can wait for - the shell of the army, which will be missing the core.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a brigade with no ammunition."
"It'll be like a flight without trained pilots."
"They'll be like a paper tiger, like an army consignee, a building and a bomb without enough trained soldiers to finish the mission," Panetta said at the start of the Pentagon speech.
"It will be like a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to balance the possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome the aggression..."
In the annex to the letter from McCain and Graham Panetta, it specifies how to reduce the "significant operational risks: late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant restrictions on the possibility of landing and landing worldwide; anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
Panetta added that some of the largest defence projects could be expected to end, including those that have already been tested, and those that are only in the early stages of planning.
For example, there was a project on the F35 aircraft planned for a new bomber, the ballistic substations of a new generation, a new coastal warship and a new ground-based war vehicle that wanted to replace Humvee.
Another development and testing of the F35 aircraft would save US$ 80 billion over the next ten years, but its supporters claim that there is a need for another step in improving the army, which is necessary for the country to deal with potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize the lie
The summer view of recent news headlines suggests how serious and everywhere lies and deception are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has a full hand in accusing him of sexually harassing several women - both sides claim that the other lies.
The managers at Penn State University were accused of false testimony when they tried to hide the records that a retired football coach sexually assaulted the boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was arrested, as the released microphone tells American President Barrac Obama that the Israeli President of the Benjamin Netanyahu government is a liar.
She has managed to destroy all her careers and close the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made himself a fool when he published information that was immediately misled by unquestionable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of using the funds from his campaign to try to hide his unmarried relationship.
And no one will ever forget about the media circus that shot around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in charge of his sexual drive with Monica Levinski.
It's just a bunch of stories about cheating at school and at the university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers, just to make them look good in their own judgment.
Mentors who should teach vices send a message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many frauds are we meeting?
Studies show you're lying somewhere between 10 and 200 cases in one day.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that during the first ten minutes of the first meeting in life, foreigners failed three times.
The definition of a lie, or "the recognition of a lie", is an essential skill that everyone should gain for personal or work reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, Sharad, when a person shouts, "I have you." The identification of the scam is a serious science sector working with scientific data collected during the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths of lies were invented.
Liars look quietly in your eyes.
It's not like they'd stick around, cook, red, or get sick.
But don't get out of it because it's kind of difficult for liars to watch and discover.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from a large building, small expressions in the face, how to create questions and their timing.
I spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from the extensive and evolving sector of lie recognition, and it is clear that the discovery of fraud is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can be of great help to you in today's complex world - especially if your duties include hiring, organizing interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them be taken into custody, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other party accepts them.
From research we know that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men carry more "self-centered" lies, while women say more lies "focused on others" - most of them to protect some feelings - that marriage people lie less often to their partners than free people (although the lies they say are mostly "unfortunate").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called initial observation.
Thanks to him, he'll have a later finding out what to compare with.
Note the keeping of the body of the subject, his smile, the work of the voice.
You should know if someone is always sticking to your feet so you don't blame him unjustly for lying just because in the middle of the meeting he starts to stick to his feet.
Then try to determine the sounds of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But just take it as a warning signal, not as evidence of a lie.
People lying can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their imaginary story, the tip of the shoe can turn to the door, move to the exit, significantly change the posture of the body, or introduce the "left after the conversation" - exaggerated breath and change the position when a difficult report is behind them.
People conducting interviews often issue a false signal that the interview is at the end, just to see how the owl will look after its completion.
Take note of the subject's language as well.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once said and used the past time when he claimed his murdered wife was alive, which led to a state-wide search for her body.
"I had no sexual relations with that lady... Miss Levinski" or the difficult question is repeated.
The most common verbal signs are just very subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "stimulating language" when answering a difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... of what I know... according to my best knowledge."
In that response, we do not know too much about the facts, and it is often another warning signal.
There is no magic that could reveal every lie, but it is possible to gain the skill by which the lie can be exposed.
With these skills, a person will have a greater chance of finding a liar and a liar in his personal and workless absence.
Controversial plan for the construction of an oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of delay of approval by the US Government
A few days after Obama's government threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which was regarded by the committees, but calmed by environmentalists - the company with the pipeline to worry announced that it was willing to redirect the project so that things could be put back in motion.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that the transfer of the planned route leads to the pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebrasce, and is convinced that the project will be approved.
This decision was notified by the company at a press conference in the seat of the German government.
TransCanada Steps Alex Parbax argues that the company is convinced that the construction of the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it will lead to another route.
This notification came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it was deferring a decision on a federal project permit, from which it did not conduct a study of possible replacement routes that would enable it not to be affected in the Sandhills area in Nebraska and in the watershed level of Ogallal, scattered underground water resources.
"This is really a move forward," said Republican representative Lee Terry of Nebrasky for Fox News.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably withdraw any decision until 2013, i.e. the year following the elections next year, however, the authorities refuse to play a political role in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as a request from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and expressed his support.
1 700 miles of long pipes will connect Canada and Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to the refinery in Texas, it protects 700,000 barrels of oil a day.
This way will have to be six states.
This project is totally hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by workers who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the pipes.
However, the legislators in Nebraska opposed this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would make it impossible for the company to enter the Sand Hills region and Ogalla, the main source of drinking water and moisture.
The current study on the environmental impact ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have only a small negative environmental impact, although the source of the energy industry said that the General Inspector of the Ministry ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study, and focused mainly on two questions.
Once it was that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's advisor in 2008, was not present in the conflict of interest program.
Next, whether the company that was hired to conduct the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of having returned fears because of her battalion
The New York family claims that the singer Patti LaBelle has just entered the vestibule of their Manhattan home and scared their daughter so that she has returned from fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" hit's performance frightened eighteen-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "change of personality, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family claimed in the lawsuit brought to the Manhattan Supreme Court.
Last November 10th, Kevin Monk, his wife Rosaanna, a teacher at school, and Genevieve were on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk parked the car, Rosana Monkova met down to the vestibule of their house in the Riverside Boulevard and took with him and Genevieve.
Rosaanna Monková said she stopped at the door for a while and delayed her baby for a while.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I left to pick her up."
LaBelle suddenly kissed the pregnant woman.
"The aggressive tone said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door," said Rosanad Monková.
"I told her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She got angry and started speaking in a loud voice, shouting the simplest words...
She had a bottle of water with her, and she started looking for me.
They say Genevieve got a hysterical seizure.
"I said to the woman, "Look what you did to my daughter." "The mother declared the child.
LaBelle went to her mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - threw her away and had to stop her until she was escorted to her waiting car, said Rosanad Monková.
In the meantime, the daughter cried so much when she returned, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter requesting an apology from LaBelle, but they did not receive any answers.
Lawyer and speaker LaBelle won't respond to our phone calls to make a statement about the whole cause.
The complaint requires closer unresolved compensation, but the family legal representative, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken free of charge and that the family plans to spend all the money spent on charity organizations dealing with children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," said Davis.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child."
The climate has slowed the economy
During the first year of government Maria López Valdez grew unemployment and insecurity in Sinaloa, decreased foreign investment and with them the economy
The year 2011 will be recorded in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, which is called the government change. This government has brought with it a great expectation in terms of economic progress, but for reasons of unfavourable climate conditions at the beginning of the year, there has been no growth and even a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, limited the potential for growth in the state economy, have a 3.6% reduction in economic activity in the first half of this year.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was recorded at 582 835 hectares of cultivated land, 78.03% of which was completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were found to be partial damage.
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, employment rates in the state were increasing during the first three quarters of the year. Between January and March 55,053 people in Sinaloa were unemployed, which represents the unemployment rate of 4,53% of the population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5,28% and between July and July, average unemployment continued to rise and reached 6,19%, representing approximately 74 000 unemployed.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantese, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of UAS, it is possible to explain the increase in unemployment indirectly, on the basis of the steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnesses of increasing unemployment related to various factors. They include, among other things, the loss of liquidity on the market due to the limitation of resources resulting from legislation approved by the Congress in connection with the fight against money laundering. For people who illegally strengthen dollars, it is not easy to earn them, invest them or use them for something," he stressed.
Stop migration
López Cervantes stated that there is also a demographic factor to increase unemployment.
"The number of people leaving for work abroad, in the United States, has decreased, but this is due to an inability to enter and then because even though these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job. People remain and demand work from our state, and so unemployment is growing," he said.
Untrusted
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also worsening because of the growing uncertainty that prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of employed people in the state are working without taking social security contributions.
Other labour market figures, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and insecurity. In this administrative area, the lowest payments are from the country as indicated by the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesetas in September, deeply below the national average, which is moving to 7,375 pesetas.
Abbreviation of direct foreign investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment in 2011, the most significant decline in direct foreign investment over the past 10 years has been recorded. According to the Ministry of Finance, direct foreign investment of $630,697 was achieved from January to June, representing a decrease of 87.74% against $5,143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State states that investments amounting to 17 280 million pesetas per year were directed primarily to companies in the field of services.
Dluh
In connection with the economic downturn, the government requested the State Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revive the economy. Local Congress approved a loan of 2 600 million pesos. In November there was no profit from the debt and no government sector.
Reaction
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government, Maria López Valdèse, pointed to a lack of government leadership.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, announced that in 2011 there was a lack of agreement between the individual sectors, including the government itself.
"The evolution of the economy in Sinaloa was truly inconceivable during this year. We have to work intensively to regain the land we lost this year. In 2012 we have to double our efforts, lack of harmonisation of our efforts, and in particular the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. We hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
The slow pace of the economy
Loredo López pointed out that events like the early days of the year had stopped the state economy and had limited its development and growth.
"A weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including the cold. One of the main consequences was slowing down the economy, which did not remember fast enough to be able to reinvigorate the dynamism that would enable us to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services.
Redefinition of the mission
According to Theodore Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employers' Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general we note that it is working. We believe that a long-term plan should be prepared, in which the objectives and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
The work that is ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future, which would better govern the efforts of the government.
"In general, I would say that the government has been trying to achieve good results in different areas, but some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He stated that the current administration had shown progress with regard to the governance of public policy.
"There are elements that allow the government to claim that it is trying to be attractive. I can say that there is a job done here and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kg marijuana
The inhabitants of Navolato were sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of imprisonment for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a criminal offence of endangering health, specifically for holding marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuel Sandoval was detained by the Mexican army on 7 June 2010 at the junction of Cipriano Valdez, opposite station 80 in El Castillo quarter, Navolato.
Dealer was driving in a pick-up white. In the car in the box had a black bag and on the seat of the co-pilot a small bag. Soldiers found 8 kilograms 23 grams marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured man has remained at the disposal of the Judge of the Second Division and the Court of Justice remains internal within the Centre for the Legal Impact of Crimes.
It owes contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of the programs such as Habitat, Save public places and 3x1 for migrants, face the danger that they will not be involved in the end or that they will be very late due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Urban Social Development has stated that if construction work has been carried forward so far, it is now threatening that the government will not be able to provide the relevant supplies that require more than 11 million weights for three programmes.
He stated that the total investment in these three programmes is nearly 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. Only the Federation and the city were added to the work at this time, so it is possible that the projects will be delayed.
"They're supposed to secure nearly 12 million and even though the year is about to end, we've got nothing. And even though we should have got a share already in July," he said. "In order not to waste our time, we started projects and continue very slowly, but we lack money."
He stated that last year the government of Jesse Aguilara Padilla failed to comply with the relevant supplies, and therefore at the beginning of the new period, the city had to ask for a loan to pay more than 7 million that had not been granted to them by the government.
"The same thing has already happened to us in the previous sixties, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes went on. To get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to get the funds that would cover what did not end the state," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment by the State representatives regarding the transmission of these resources, he stated that the request was sent to Armand Villareal, a secretary for administration and finance in order to speed up the management process and the corresponding percentage reached as soon as possible.
"We were supposed to give us 12 million, and although the year is nearing its end, we have not yet received a weight."
Court approves "end of analogous transmission" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analogous digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of State (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaint submitted by the Senate and the Ambassador against the presidential decree, which wanted to speed up the so-called "off-off of analogous signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juana Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón did not go beyond his authority when he issued a decree stating the individual steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the complaint lodged by the Senate was rejected, because a qualified majority of eight votes were not reached in order to enable the Court to express its position or the inconsistency of the decree, which remains valid.
The motion for a resolution drawn up by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Sánchez Cordero, provides for the possibility of declaring a decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all matters relating to radio and television is a matter which the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) has been replaced by law.
For the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Ambassadors supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described in it leading to the transition to digitisation.
The meeting of the Ministers also decided to reject the complaint submitted by the Ambassador without entering the discussion on the proposal, which also concerns Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that it was not compatible with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive could not structure through the general standards of measures to prepare public administration.
"I don't think that, even if she did, that would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive who has constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The reward of analogous digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It relates to better use of radio spectrum, better quality of signal and more channels.
It is believed that to remove the change would mean to remove the benefit of digitisation that requires a decision in the matter of public interest. Digitalisation does not only have a technical dimension, but "also concerns economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these issues "need the operation of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the State. It includes a whole range of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the government of the State".
He recalled that a whole number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and have done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialized technical authorities.
He stated that it is not possible for the government to bring an inconsistency decree, which to some extent involves the power of the Congress, into the administrative area of compliance with laws prepared by the legislative powers.
In Michoacán, they analyze the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the data published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second seats in the governor's elections is not a total of 27 per cent. So far, 879 votes in the 6074 electoral districts have not been counted.
The "voice-by-voice" option was found in this year's elections in Michoacán, where according to data published by the Pre-Vollection Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and second positions in the governor's elections was not all 27 per cent, and 879 votes from the total of 6074 electoral districts have not been read yet.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Institute of Election in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llandral Zaragoza, recalled that a number of days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority approved a number of measures that should harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be noted, Michoacán has not officially confirmed his political constitution or his State Election Code or the Electoral Justice Act. The State Congress has approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this election period has expired, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel mentioned their publication within the time limit set in the Law of the Official Journal with some opposition against him.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of State (SCJN) settled a constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative powers and declared the State's head of state in the matter of constitutional reforms as "free and illegal", because it has no right "to approve or veto".
On the question of the possibility of counting "voice by voice" María de los Ángeles Llandral answered that the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council would allow partial and comprehensive calculation to be carried out by the local electoral authority.
In this way, partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be carried out under the following conditions: election results do not agree; there is no record of counting of votes and calculation in the relevant box or has no president available to it; or if there have been errors and obvious violations of the election results.
In addition, the overall recalculation of votes in all the polling hours will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in the second place is less or equal to one percentage point; whenever at the beginning of the session there is an explicit request by the representative of the party and/or the coalition that proposed the candidate in the second place.
The total recalculation of votes will also be possible when, after proper calculation, the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point and also always when there is a explicit request by the political party whose candidate ended in the second place. In this case, the electoral packages in which partial calculations were made will be deleted.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between the first and the second non-total 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Fire Hill, confirmed by the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés was transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday, the celebration ceremony and the background mass will be held.
According to the family, it was the lieutenant's last wish that his ashes be scattered on the Zapalinam Hill.
After the family returned to the capital of Coahuil on board the plane of the Mexican Air Force. The family and the closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the afternoon, the Colonel's ashes arrived in a chapel in the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where family and friends also arrived.
At 5:30 a.m., a divorce took place at the Institute of Technology in Saltillo, which organized his former high-tech associates and members of the American football team Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of the graduation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes were scattered in the mountains of Zapalinam. That's what he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, a pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of his life, "it was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and went to the College del Aires Air School in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said that he was driving a truck, but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio reminds him of him as a very good man, "sorry came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
A young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan to promote his uncle, so he is convinced that he died in what he had best in life: flight management.
They gave him the last goodbye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, a sub-complementary of the Mexican Air Force, we have given up all the directions he received from Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leading representatives and students of the University of Saltillo Technology, where he studied in 1985 and where he won both in the study and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the last days after the helicopter who was driving fell. He was also on board the government's secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all the officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of the Saltileen parent Bacio Cortés (supplyed) arrived to be handed over through funeral services by the Mexican Air Force under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez on the screen, where his family, his daughter Amanda and Cristina's wife, mother, relatives and other relatives, students and teachers gathered.
There were three abandoned dead bodies on the ship Cadereyta NL
Several hours before the military presence, the representatives represented 11 persons who were detained in this area for crimes related to organised crime.
The bodies of three men killed in various parts of the body and heads were found on the abandoned ship of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
It was found on the 1.5 km road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the chat with the bee-coffee plot had time since the door opened.
When they looked inside, about three feet [3 m] away, they noticed the corpse of three people, so they immediately warned the authorities.
One person had on himself a sports shirt of yellow and dark cotton pants and was not dressed. Next to it, a person was also sitting in a sports shirt with white stripes.
About a few meters later, there were other persons dressed in red sports shirts and blue cotton pants.
All three were facing the ground.
According to the data obtained at the sites, all three persons were probably killed at another location because they were not found.
The chat area found messages addressed to one group of organised crime the other and also a series of bullets trails, both on the building and on the doors.
In Cadereyta, 11 suspects were detained.
The National Defence Secrets represented 11 persons, including young people, who were members of the criminal group, who operated in particular in the area of Cadereyt and who were linked to kidnapping, murder, prosecution and unlawful burial.
According to the information published during the first attempt on 11 November, 8 persons were detained in the Los Alveros colony and one detained person was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. They confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
The next raid took place on 12 November at 6 o'clock. Military personnel were on the run in Rancho Viejo area in Cadereyt when he noticed a car without SPZ and two persons in it.
After stopping the car, they took a look and found one gun, a gun and 18 bullets.
Then, based on these statements, about 14 o'clock on November 13 a.m., one of La Frauda's complexes was detained. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were accused of illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
The appointed President of the Government of Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that this country is holding over the economic disaster.
The appointed President of the Government of Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present him with a new government that will face the crisis that keeps this country in control of the economic disaster and which has put the euro area at risk.
The Presidential Palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorge Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can create a government.
It is expected to represent a government made up of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks, which he led with the political parties in an effort to create a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to create a government, but his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti completed the process of creating a government in just three days, i.e. much shorter than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has resulted in the long-term debt to an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Montim, must approve the hard package of rescue measures required by European leaders, which will only restore Italy's unresolved credibility.
In Montiho there is a great pressure to accelerate. Due to the instability of the markets, interest in Italian bonds BTP with a 10-year maturity was exceeded by 7 percentage points, the level where Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian Employers' Organization, told reporters after the meeting with Montim: "We said we would be very supportive of this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this fiery situation.
Monti’s hopes for success were significantly enhanced by support from PDL Silvia Berlusconi, whose crisis contributed to the resignation on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended for good results," Angelin Alfano, a secretary of the Middle East, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is important because so far, a whole number of its members have opposed the government with the technical majority that Monti is making up.
Parliament support
The new Monti government must have strong support for Parliament in order to promote non-popular sustainable reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in this effort could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could mean disaster.
Monti started a discussion on Monday with political parties, committees and business groups, youth organisations and women.
The round of negotiations will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed President Napolitan on Sunday, which enabled a very rapid process in response to the crisis.
After a short decline from the end of last week, when it was already apparent that Berlusconi was giving the demise, the interest of Italian bonds returned to the critical border and thus reacted to uncertainty as to whether the new president of the government was making a success.
To save Italy whose public debt is running at EUR 1.8 billion would be beyond the scope of the current financial reserves of the euro area.
Monti stated that his government should be able to hold until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite the general projections that say politicians are only giving him time to reform, and then announce early elections.
Monti stated that he would like to join his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to remove Italy from the difficulties that the country was experiencing because of the financial pressure.
Political sources have stated that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to join the government and political personality.
Spanish with participation in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will cross the border of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 popular players has scored 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rican side, if we compare 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While world and Europe masters, the number one monthly FIFA rating, have on their account a wide range of class A selection matches, Costa Rica has only the defender Michael Uman, who played 50 international matches as the only one.
This number reached last Friday in the struggle against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers who play in the Battle of Stars and in the powerful clubs of the English first leagues maintain intense activity over the year in league championships and domestic Cups and high-level matches in European Cups like Champions League.
In the past, we also need to add experience from the Spanish national team in complex eradication matches at the European and world championships.
On the other hand, Costa Rican players have very limited possibilities for foreign matches in the field. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish representation has on its own account Iker Casillas, who reached the former Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches on Saturday before England (lose 0-1 in London).
Casillas is coming up against Costa Rica today and receives a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, the key player in Barcelona, has 106 matches on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were officially declared UEFA last week with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches on their account. Among them is the Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
A hundred approached Carles Puyol with 97 matches.
The following are Xabi Alonso, 91; Fernando Torres, 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both 81; Andrés Inista, 62; Cesc Fábregas, 61; and David Silva, 53.
On the Costa Rican side and close to Michael Uman, the left wing of Junior Díaz is moving 48 matches and Bryan Ruiz's career is 45.
In addition, only 5 won 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Minimum number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best Spanish shooter is David Villa with 50 goals and follows Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side is the most affected by Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in his tour at the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, the base of Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next week.
We waited for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures them that the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream.
That's what the bassist and founder member Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent in the course of the tour at the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence and on Sunday 20 it will be at a unique stop in Central America.
This day will take place from 19:30 at the National Stadium along with the English band The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample of the conversation you will find on the La Nazion website.
Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are enjoying?
The road to Costa Rica is also our dream that becomes reality.
In South and Central America we have hardly had a second and modern experience.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're very glad we can bring you our music.
I wonder, because the group literally adores this group, fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensively.
What do you say to your most rocked benefactors?
Thank you for standing with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years before we got to Costa Rica.
Some people are already talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Is it causing more pressure in you?
Some of the biggest shows we've had in the last 21 years have been created in the horizon for several weeks.
We had some great shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope we got into the form of a concert at Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like serfing, we like jungles. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you meet Costa Ricardo and her waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of friends of surfers and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends are going surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best surfing places. And so we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tours, you've prepared a great show with a lot of songs.
What were you planning for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no limits that we can't do.
We will try to play the best show with various compositions. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans a good and varied repertoire.
You never repeat a repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes other songs, so it's hard to choose which songs we play every night.
When we have two songs in the repertoire that we haven't played for a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten them.
So it's more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of artistic careers.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yeah, sure.
First of all, I think none of us could imagine that we're going to be in a big rock band and we're gonna stay in it for more than 20 years, that sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given and we are impressed that we can still play together.
We love each other, and we like to make music.
We're lucky to be able to look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't have gotten better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, which is represented by the great ones themselves.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when the movement comes from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, there will be a group in the city, but it is much less common to have five to ten groups from one city to another.
We're proud of it and we're honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we play with some more.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on the tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honoured that we can be part of this movement that occurred in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to keep together and have the same members after those years.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is a long time longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think that first we all are lucky that we are still in this world and secondly in our role is playing the fact that we are constantly interested in each other.
All of us are close friends and thanks to this, we have managed to open up the music paths that leave each person with sufficient freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, respect each other's music, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word of glory was not easy, but thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it was gradually the easiest way to find balance.
We're trying not to go too far on tour because it's very easy to fall into this trap of dust and people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come for music, remember that you have to respect music and what you have given it, and don't let yourself be thrown away by being famous rock stars.
How do you remember another Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and at first it was something huge.
As a band, we existed for three years and never released any albums until Andrew Woods died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to some song or look at pictures, I remember Andy, how incredible it was as I talked to him. It was always joy to work with him, laugh, have fun about music or about football and many more.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
The Las Robertas National Chapel will be entrusted with the launch of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose them as ancestors?
Yes, the production sent us a video with a few suggestions and this group liked us the most. That's why we're curious what Las Robertas is offering alive and must be very fun.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter?
That's Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He's singing it and I think he's adding the first thing he's gonna do.
Who's affecting you as a base?
A lot of people.
I'm the first to be attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them that I could talk all night about the basics that I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge, though he's no longer in fashion?
I think we've all always felt a slight separation from the grunge.
When the grunge is said, I imagine groups that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. And if this music applies today, it's something great, because it's the music that's worth listening to, and groups like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever before.
At first your music was slightly cloudy and now it's more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting, because I feel that there are a few collections in the new album that are easier to manage, but also there are songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very cloudy, although they may sound positive.
At both, when Ed played it for me, I cried, and it's songs deep dark.
I think that when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone in your family or friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs are just what this is for me.
I also think that you can be a happy man and still do the cloudy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was again hospitalized for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss, which he suffers in the field of lower limbs, informed his treating doctor.
72 - year - old Fujimori, who suffers from 25 years of imprisonment for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from a number of diseases, including cancers in the language, which have been operated four times and are currently controlled by doctors.
Ambassador Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told the TV station Canal N that Fujimori would undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in three days, where they should find out why it hurts and why he loses his strength in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that, in his view, Fujimori could obtain mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want it because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times because of the cancer of the tongue, he weighed 18 kilograms, and these problems added other disorders such as severe erosion gastritis, lead cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and running problems in his legs, he appointed a doctor.
Fujimori has been punishing himself since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons who killed the murder squad of an illegal army in the first years of his government.
Music at a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the Uruguayan President, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, starts a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. Its aim is to reach an expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch on the political issues of the region.
The music will meet with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón. It is the most important meeting of a wide-ranging meeting with the representatives of politics, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program has been published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between both countries," the Uruguayan presidential office published on its websites.
According to local media, Mujica will try to take Calderón to support Uruguay in the dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy made a list of tax havens for the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that the countries that will continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be expelled from the international community, and this declaration sparked a negative opinion by Uruguay and consultation with the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico is president of the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world. With the said Latin American country, it has since January this year concluded an exchange of information agreement to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has sought to concrete the agreement on fiscal exchange with a view to obtaining from the "Black Paper" Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which are countries that have not established all the required international standards of cooperation in the area of data.
From the commercial point of view of Mexico and Uruguay, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has been concluded since 2004 with a view to strengthening trade between the two countries.
Vousate installer runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bowser's crime traps, but has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of the girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month into all trades around the world, has been created from the beginning to use all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character that has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said a press officer who specializes in Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created especially for this carrier", because so far successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Gold: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations to existing titles.
Speaker Nintendo said that besides the video is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and throttle game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", with the task of attracting less skilled users.
Once you win this level, you can get into the second wheel on the level games that are more demanding this time.
In addition, users can choose a real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome the most diverse challenges and "not to rely on optical traps".
This new Super Maria 3D approach also assumes the return of the post to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo plays into the notes of those who watch saws and repeats a successful formula from previous works. It consists in the fact that the installation of a man's cab will have to go through dangerous reverse platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in motion, in the surroundings, in the embraces, and also among the enemies, Luigi will also appear.
Colom approved the issue of Portilla to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has taken steps to issue former President Alfonse Portilla, who is to be responsible for the conspiracy to clean 70 million US dollars.
This is how the process ends, with the aim of having Guatemala answer to the request of the northern country that requires the issue of Portilla to be judged.
At the Colom press conference, he confirmed that his decision was in accordance with the independence of the judiciary and the executive power and that he remembered that the criminal court had already ordered the extradition.
He ensured that during his term of office, he "did not involve" in judicial decisions and allowed all the publications that he had received on his desk.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be released for murder and serious health injuries and Edgar Estrad Morales and Victor Estrad Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloma's move means a step of execution after all the judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted in order to bring proceedings against the former President, who ruled in 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent in the case of a 120 million crimes against the Ministry of Defence at the time of his presidency. This process was preceded by the issue, but the Public Ministry withdrew and returned the case to the game.
Trinijo helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to help children without education not to feel at the edge of society.
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of Trinijo's social support organisation is very important: 6,000 young people who have threatened social exclusion have been helped.
To this end, a long hundreds of jobs have to be added, which have been obtained for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present a balance sheet within the framework of the celebration act, which took place in the former manufacturing premises of Fabra i Coats and which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijo's organization was created in the fourth Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work dealing with drug dependence or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
A large number of representatives of organisations and institutions who worked with the association in the past 25 years attended the last meeting in Sant Andreu.
The various political representations, at the time of the elections, showed the uniform nature of the work carried out by Trinijos.
Together with President Generalitat, Artur Mass, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former socialist education consultant Ernest Maragall, and former mayor of old age and current environmental and socialist council Richard Goma.
In the large hall Fabra and Coats, a current consultant for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of Social Work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, were also delivered.
Mas said that Trinijo was born in a very difficult time and that today's time is also overshadowing a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day is "a good foundation".
The President introduced Trinijo as an example of how to fight negative circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not for this organization and for the work it does, I'm destroying new," he said.
There's been a ban on the house where giant parties were held.
Firefighters own 11 out of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 occupyors left the house yesterday afternoon without resisting
Everything points to the fact that the nightmare experienced by neighbors of number 51 on Balmes Street is finally over.
Yesterday, 12 people volunteered to leave the building, which they illegally lived in, and where they organized giant parties that built neighbors. They left the building from the court regulation without having to involve the police.
After the operation was completed, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent the recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be monitored," the manager said.
The occupants who took 11 out of 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all electrical and partly water facilities, and painted the walls and left after themselves all kinds of waste, especially bottles after alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties that lasted up to two days and provoked the other tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europe Press that the market dropped by 80% at the time the building was occupied.
The owner of the discotheque emphasises that the occupants of the buildings had made it incontestable, because they sold drinks for 3 euros, which is worth 10 on the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the demands of neighbors for noise. However, the problems did not affect the visitors of discotheques, but the residents of the closed house, and especially those who attended the scheduled parties, whose frequency and intensity have increased in recent weeks, according to the disparate inhabitants of the area.
The discotheque owner explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and would forgive her for nine months.
The City Police also confirmed that over the past few weeks, she had received more complaints from her neighbors about the situation.
The president of the City Group of the People's Party of PP at the Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week demanded that "the building was immediately moved and ended with problems of civil society suffering from neighbors and destruction of the area".
The president of the people explained that only one step had been taken a year ago, but in recent months the occupations had reached all the patrons of the building and almost all the apartments, and even in one of them there was theft.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and to be consistent when it comes to the consequences of the civil liability that occurred in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also cleaned up the building in Nou Barris.
In 15 hours 30 minutes the police got into the building 35 on Mont-ral Street after she was called by the neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
Architects met at the time of the writing of proceedings that took more than a debate on honorary matters
The city selection procedure on the 16 gates reopens the debate on the role of Collserol Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, at the time of the largest flower, Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-government printed several pamphlets to support the Collserola Park.
The plane defined the mountain as a large metro park in Barcelona.
More than that, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with the New York Central Park.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper border of Barcelona. Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not point either north - them, but up (hora) - down (the sea).
The Colliserola qualify as a natural park goes this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild bears instead of Yogi.
This was the position until September, when the council announced a mega competition with 16 competitions for the same number of entry gates to Collserola.
The door, of course, records more of the park's thoughts.
Either this or someone's trying to put the door on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and on the basis of a reflection of the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already as sharp as the two members of this old cast chosen at the meeting in the elevator give their hand.
And that's exactly what he called a rare agreement between what three Barcelona architects and the pre-existing university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayon: the selection procedure has its justification.
According to Roldán, after the question of the Gulf side began, "you should" also discuss "the mountain side", so Ildefonse Cerd's presentation of green apples was not questioned to the end.
"We must come from the principle that the longest Barcelona park is the beach.
Among other things, his great availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, whose name "doors to Collserola" in himself is "lexical paste": we cannot imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a definition of the zone where it is possible to operate".
The module, like Roldán and Bayon, with the experience of urbanism, qualifies as an "intellectual challenge" that triggers "some danger".
It is a danger arising from the "indiscriminateness which today represents the project of a public place" after the experience of the 1980s, which had in the area of the Forum "his singing lab".
The first concern is the very definition of borders where they should be built.
"Something is meant to take another step", it's basically moving on.
"There must be new urbanist and planning tools in mind, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP)) can cause a real loss."
If we focus more on the question, the Modol believes that the long-term collserol strain can be considered as a park, but the Barcelona part is not, for purely topographic reasons.
The module also recalled that there is already a work carried out by Patronat de Collserola, which "should not end up in the garbage dump", even though it welcomes the fact that the workers offer his grammatical work to the project from the "first moment".
Moreover, it understands that the proximity of the mountains and cities is a sort of failure that enables architects to engage in the debate, but "questions" that it should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skill", he adds), which must be created: "The architects should be just tools".
Bayona points out that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex, because in the basis for the selection procedure there is a lack of a global vision of Collserol: "There have been 16 selection procedures that deal with all the axis of the mountains - the sea, but there is no further study that would look into the area and understand it as a whole".
That makes him, at least, sign up for all 16 election procedures.
On the other hand, the design of one gate may interfere with the concept and definition of the neighboring gate architect.
In his view, the council should ensure that a band located directly above Ronda de Dalt should ensure a long-range area of equipment that would ensure a gas transition between the city and the green.
Casino passed to Jonas Larrazábal to be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legal corps of Cadino Red granted his brother the love of old Monterey in the process in which he was reached for alleged harassment.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison, and now he will be released after the legal agent Casino Red granted him mercy before the Second Criminal Court in the county in which he discussed the case of the interrogation, in which he was accused by the old brother of Monterrey.
After the assassination of Casino Royale owner Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas had to request payment of an economic quota to allow workers in Monterrey to operate illegally in the auction house.
After a public complaint, the State Prosecutor initiated a criminal complaint against the Panistic Old Brother. On 2 September, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then, after 4 hours in front of the Public Prosecutor's Agent, number 3 for property crimes was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo, the capital of the state.
The following 49 days after the second prison regulation was adopted and the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs lost the possibility of co-existence or organised crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyta for suspecting that the owners of Casino Red had been exhausted by one and a half million pounds. However, only a few hours remained in prison with moderate surveillance because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in the city halls in San Nicolas de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October, he was ordered to be arrested by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who declared that, almost two months after the investigation, sufficient evidence had been gathered to prove Jonah’s guilt. Among the evidence, for example, the payment of 1.5 million pounds to casino representatives in exchange for a pledge that the operation would be allowed.
This Monday, the legal commander of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gomez, delivered to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the old-age brother of the region. On this basis, he will be able to return to freedom soon.
During the legal proceedings with the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomez whether the damage had been repaired and who of the partners decided to grant mercy. However, the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain hidden.
On the basis of official record 197/2011, the legal grace of Jonas Larrazábal shall be granted. In the proceedings against him there will be no complaint. It is also not possible to ask for damages or punishment.
After remanding with the legal authority about 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larzazabal Breton.
The Registrar of the Court, Jorge Yanez, went to the prison in San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted official mercy and that his case had been postponed to the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate regulation for his release.
The Secretary of Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the plane crash, where the secretary of the governor, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident, in which the government's secretary, Francisco Blake Mora and seven others died, showed that the helicopter had hit the ground with full force without the pilot being given a chance to attempt forced landing.
At the Dionisio Pérez Jácome press conference, a communicator and transport, stated that prior to the launch of the aircraft, the pilot found that climate conditions allow for years.
"The parts that appear suggest that the unit has come into contact with the field several times, the wings interfered with the tree plant 25 meters from the place where the unit lost the body."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons, so he met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he stated that no components were found on the ground on the basis of an investigation carried out in the area of the attack.
"When searching, it was found that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the plane hit the ground as a celestial.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, meeting all the requirements for the transport of persons.
The ground shows the ground with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The Secretary has ensured that at the moment it is most important to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Relief Services, announced that at the time of the attack, the helicopter of the President General Staff was moving at the speed of the flight and an accident occurred in the soft terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that during the accident, it was a regular over-fly operation," he said.
At the press conference, the representative of the SCT Pérez Jácome appointed six basic points of investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the air standards, the flight was carried out in accordance with the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must see on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports set out the appropriate conditions at the start, according to which the aircraft is heading at the border, the ground levels between DF and the State of Mexico were cloudy at low altitudes.
Selected tracks:
It is likely that the dark crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the attack.
The coordinates of the attack and the last recording of the helicopter from the radar are consistent, it is likely that there was no loss of control or a breach of the flight path prior to the attack.
Deployment of aircraft residues in a restricted area:
The information that we have at the moment allows us to assume that the impact has occurred on the same trajectories and on the side.
The design of the aircraft's residue clearance indicates that at the time of the impact on the ground, the helicopter was a celestial.
There was no fire or explosion.
Unfortunately, no evidence was found to testify that there was an outbreak or a fire.
The final results of the investigation show that there may have been several contacts with the fortress.
During field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above the sea, the ground is frozen, the height ranges from seven to 30 degrees.
Photographs show images where there was likely to be a breakdown along the said route.
Information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could be reached in contact with countries in several places.
After careful exploration in the vicinity of an accident, in an area more extensive than the area of extinction, no remnants of the helicopter were found, which reinforces the belief that there was an attack in a state when the helicopter was still a celestial one.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has initiated a gene research that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to identify the gene responsible for the presence of children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the Institute of IPN
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to reveal a gene that causes obesity in children and young people. Research called "Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents" allows for results on overweight.
In a report by the Head of the Medical Research Unit in the field of biochemistry from the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team was set up consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition experts and social workers.
This team is supported by specialists and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
It is also possible to join the research with a broad public, with or without permission. People can join the IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where every congregation will be conducting tests in youth for 8 hours.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexico State) and since 8 October this activity has also been carried out at the Non-Zahualcoyolt Sports Centre (East of Mexico State).
As soon as data are obtained from 500 children to 600 children, the study will continue at the Centre for Sports Independence (so far from the Federal District) and finally at the Sport Centre Morelos (so far from the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research was to identify the components and importance of genetics in terms of obesity development, and to highlight the risk factors for Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the aim was to gather data from three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 with consent and under the supervision of parents for the application of specific food questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also be asked about physical activity and family history of inherited diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause disease such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He clarified that anthropometric measurements (weight, height, band circumference), blood pressure, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, and insulin are carried out every Saturday, and genes are tested (i.e. genes that share child obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this study reflects the concern of doctors about the alarming increase in the child’s weight.
'Health surveys carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years only boys had a 77% increase in obesity and girls 47%.
He stated that one of the reasons for seeking indicators is the belief that the country's population differs from other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% of Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in genes responsible for developing diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity is usually explained as a failure to burn excess energy, which we consume (calorie) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of participants is that they will receive an overall assessment of the status of children, which will determine whether they are aware of the excess or obsessive.
He stated that even the presence of dark color enemies (acantosis) on the neck and the premixture suggests that the individual in question would be suffering from metabolic problems and pre-inflammatory conditions.
The information is reliable, doctors give it to their parents in writing and explain to them all the measurements and changes in their lifestyle that they need to make in order to prevent their children from getting sick.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic illness: the present way of life that means a lack of daily physical activity, the full-day exposure to television and the use of means of transport instead of a short distance walk.
The excess also produces a large caloric intake, which is greater consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (tamals, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fats and proteins and a genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
In Asphalt with UNAM there will be no compensation
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, creates modified asphalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature
If it were to be properly cared for, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 thousand floods after each rainy period in the Metropolitan Region of Valle de México, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist at the Chemical Faculty (FQ) of UNAM, who at the same time added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt discharges were adequate, a significant limitation would have occurred or even could have been completely removed.
In his lecture Technology Cause of Explanations, which he spoke of during the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that a laboratory under his supervision develops modified asphalts with polymers, which should produce a mixture with similar characteristics asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera is believed that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, for example in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce the production of spices.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is the collection of carbon molecules, a molecule with a large molecular mass called asphalts, and other with a low molecular mass called maltens. Together they supply asphalt with a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoalytic nature of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it acts as a liquid, at 120 degrees it has high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in a fixed state, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to laminate, added.
This means that asphalt resistance in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures have been observed by the expert on chemical engineering.
A scientist at the Chemical Faculty observed that most streets in Ciudad de México are covered with a flexible fur, which consists of six types of materials, of which the last three are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers is an asphalt cartridge made of small stones with asphalt and then pressed.
He stressed that any stone that forms a cartridge is asphalt.
When passing a car or creating pressure, it is possible that the forces in the skin spread well.
If it were a modified asphalt, they'd spread even better, it's considered a chemical engineer.
He added that on the asphalt cartridge the last layer called the plaza, made of fine stones, is also the sand of the asphalt.
In view of the fact that this layer will come into contact with the vehicle rifles, it must have a greater mechanical strength than the asphalt cartridge and must ensure the friction of the vehicle.
In view of the fact that a heavy load will be exposed as part of the alloy, the plate must have sufficient thickness and must be given attention to the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor that needs to be remembered. In particular, water has a great impact on the function of the asphalt cartridge.
Once the area is wet, the water spreads inside and it's hard to get out, it causes all kinds of hair softening, and it's causing a rash.
He explained that during the production of an adage, it is the first dirty film of the plaza and then the asphalt cartridge is damaged. However, it does not occur at the same time, but it is a process that should be stopped by the first marks using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the creation of exhausts, and therefore the weight of each single layer of the oil must correspond to the load of vehicles and must ensure that this load does not exceed. Only in this way can we prevent the frequent formation of exhausts.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that in terms of asphalt, there is still much work to be done and research is at the beginning. For example, asphalt emulsions that are already available on the market in other countries are mentioned, allowing us to easily correct the requirements without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from Valle's candidate to become a new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to obtain Miss Colombia's crown.
Valle's getting the 14th title of the first multiple.
Valle del Cauca failed to reach Miss Colombia's crown again.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied that she had won a silver crown and a scarf on the basis of which she became the first ever to become the first to become a Colombia.
On the basis of the results of the last final in Cartagena, in which Miss Atlántico won and starred, the said department won the 14th title of the first vicemission. Melina thus joined the representatives of women from the Valle del Cauca, who obtained the winning crown, but eventually were declared the first vicemises. Among them are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellina Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Mariana Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000)
The question many are asking.
The result is the defeat of a great favorite that has shown in all previous rounds that it has to become a new Miss Colombia and not become free of charge to the Queen Police and the Most Beautiful face of Joile de Volgue. These titles have been achieved, for example, by Taliana Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who subsequently took the title Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name it only the First Multimission is that she did not accept her answer to the question, "Which book did you like most and why?", which Martin Murillo Gomez of the literary editor Leamos.
The candidate answered the following question:
I believe in the role of literature, I think it's one of the forms of culture. The book that most influenced me in my childhood was the Little Prince, a very deep book.
At the present time, I read "Collection and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the world literature we should all know. And today I have a book from Irene Nemirovski, Russian author. It is a wonderful book called "El Ardor de la sangre".
However, this response was not popular because of the term "culturalisation" and the second because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned to her.
After the celebration of Melina's ceremony, she said she's calm and she's happy with the result: "The world is wise what's going to happen, it's going to happen.
And you people, read if you can. The little prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.
The Bogotá newspaper pointed out that the candidate was the most popular, not famous from the beginning, and the one who took away all previous prices (Gastronomic Challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best art dress and the Queen's mother), aroused the addiction of other guests, stressed the queen who then burned on the stage.
It was visible at the first presentation of the boats on the Hilton beach and during two screenings before the final crowning.
Although on both sides, it was known that she lacked the strength and the breath that represented Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a newspaper on Canal RCN, believes that Melinda has won the first multimission title confirms the fact that a candidate who wins the most titles during the competition does not finally go with the crown of the queen."
In addition, Valle's attitude toward the media has been more abusive in recent days and it has not been paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Competition of Beauty.
Only around, two days before the election, the international board member, Lucy Doughty, said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In Miss Colombia's beauty competition is not enough about itself, it is necessary to see something more than physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feelings. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before entering the competition,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle's candidate lost points due to her lack of background and fibrosis, which was on her wrist. However, this is quite contrary to the jury's verdict that chose her Miss "natural beauty" for the most healthy body, proper diet and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the Queen, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there were better girls here, "but problems with fibrosis on her ass, which, in my opinion, was not too familiar, wore her points until the last day".
Meanwhile, magazine Guido Hoyos of Cromos believes that a relative from Valle made a mistake when she made several surgical advances.
"The surgery's okay, but they didn't succeed at the Valle.
The body was never her strong page and here she chose her tax."
For the reason of this appreciation, which was first given by the National Beauty Assembly, after the surfing in the floats, there was a harsh prediction that was fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Meliní wished not to finally give her the highest crown.
Whether it's true or not, it's certain that Melina started today's year of her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named the National Competition itself.
However, it is recorded in history as one of the queens who, despite the success of Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
This was the work of the inhabitants of Cali, who identified Alfonse Cana's corpse.
A fingerprint expert from Cali went into history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cana.
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4th of last year, an expert on fingerprints from CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader Farc: "Alfonse Cana", and this through comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprints experts working at the CTI department, Elias González, a man from Puerta Tejad, was working in the field of judicial research this week for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at a workshop in Chocó, where he often had to sell more than five days of laundry to get to the place where the dead were needed to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after he graduated from the relevant courses, he began specializing in fingerprints. This science is involved in a study of cutting the skin, which is hand and foot.
During the week of the operation against Alfonsi Can, Eliezer was told to take his clothes with him for a minimum of three days.
There was something big expected.
He went out to Cauca on Friday night in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two dead bodies and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world. That's why they asked him to take a card with Guillerm Leon Sáenze's fingerprints (his real name).
However, when he came with the investigating team to the place where the body was located, he did not recognize it because of his physical vision.
He didn't have vesy, he was dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses, much more slick.
But the prints don't.
Along with the galton lupus, an inks and a transplanter and light Eleazar started comparing the fingerprint records of the dead with the records from the card.
She didn't let it go: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was assigned to confirm to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzon that he was really the Supreme Commander Farc.
Search stopped
For the dactyloscope from Sijín de Cali, the recognition shown to Eliezer González by President Juan Manuel Santos at a press conference of operational services against "Cano" is very important.
A lot of people don't know what we're doing.
Dactyloscope is accurate science, without the possibility of a mistake that can play a key role in deciding criminal acts.
In addition to the identification of the dead, these people help in investigating criminal acts such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the persons captured.
When caught, many delinquents present false documents or have no papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and we're looking for them in the database.
The investigator explained that in the case of injury, he had to remove a piece of wall at home because the thief in this place had refused to extract a treasure full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult, because they are not intended to receive prints, but in this case we could get a full hand print and identify the perpetrator who participated in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints may also confirm or defeat suspicion in the event of murder.
They recently found a dead man with a bottle of alcohol around them.
On the basis of the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and that the printing on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it cannot be conclusively confirmed that he was a real killer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
An expert on fingerprints from the CTI explained that the prints "are controlled by chemical or physical reactive substances".
When it appears, a transplanter or a tape is used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to the Asif, which is a delinquent database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians at this time, whose data has not been entered anywhere," said an expert from the CTI.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Just like everything you're shaking, it's not gold, not everything you're touching, there's traces left.
However, if it can be used, appropriate comparisons must be made.
"Broadcasting" protests in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators pressed in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to live.
A large part of them waited for an order to clear the space and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the protests, the President of New York on Tuesday, called for a court order to return to Manhattan, where they were expelled in the morning, and then tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of demonstrators pressed in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get through a court order that allowed the "exhaled" to return to their seats. The second part of the movement responded to the clearance by taking the park to the north of the city where further detention took place.
"If the court does not allow us to go back to the square, we will settle in another place and continue in the legal battle with the aim of returning to Zuccotti, both through the assembly and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the speakers, "Let's discuss Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "stolen" to the removal of the camp, which was ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg himself, reached the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced displacement of the camp and allowed the protesters to remain here.
In addition, they took another park located on the crossroads of central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the ferry land in the Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take their place, but then the police came and held some protesters.
The organization ensures that several hundred people have settled in the area, and a delegation of religious representatives has also come to express their support and has also tried to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti, which is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected to be held on Tuesday, during which the law of early evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced demonstrators even distributed and distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to the members who were watching the square, which caused "some small cracks," Bray, who condemned the fact that some police demonstrators were.
The court order prohibits the authorities from moving the members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or from using the "laws published after the court began, or from banning demonstrators from accessing the park with shops or other places they used earlier".
Starosta Bloomberg stated for the press that, in view of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of public space and the protesters pointed out that local laws did not allow them to return to their states and packages.
The highest representative of the city has personally defended the early displacement of Zuccotti, an operation in which 200 people were detained and acceded to, because the protesters "infringed the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the square because there was "a place where people didn't go to protest, but violate laws and in some cases harm others", because "some shops received dangerous letters" and "the neighbors were concerned about the quality of their lives".
"The early cleansing was remarkable and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests in the face of the American working people," he added a speaker, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also stated that they are planning to organize "great actions" on Thursday in cooperation with community and committee organizations to remember two months after the protests.
Pamela Anderson will introduce Miss Marie in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, it will appear in the TV program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in Home Improvement, a swimmer in Baywatch, a playboy in Playboy, a wife of a year-old musician Tommy Lee and now an actress and a model will be Miss Marie in a special Christmas series of Canadian TV.
The private TV station CTV today announced that Anderson, along with singing sentimental songs by Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear in the TV program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st and will celebrate Miss Marie.
CTV today showed footage of a television program in which Anderson, also known as Internet-based porn videos, appears with his ex-husband, the "Mötley Crüe" engine, Tommy Lee, as Miss Maria holding in the picturesque doll representing Jesus.
As Joseph appears on stage Peters, a well-known Canadian comic of Indian origin, who recently acted as a moderator on the tour of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheen.
Krome Anderson and Peterse will appear in a special Christmas broadcast CTV Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisan Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York a "person".
Japan returns to life after an earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% due to household consumption and ends the period of falls that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, now recovering from an earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that countries have had to face since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government have calculated material losses of $300 billion, a wound that, despite the difficult global situation, is well under way.
After three quarters of the fall, the HDP value between July and September was reached in such a position that it was possible to turn the page with the definitive validity: HDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% annually.
The results of the second quarter - for Japan the tax year begins in March 2012 - also assume the highest rate of growth compared to the period January to March 2010.
Recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery necessary for the reconstruction of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Enterprises have increased their investment by 1.1%, spending decreases by 0.9% over the period from January to March. This is the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy comes exclusively from the impulse that forces us to use the crisis to get out of it, or to rebuild the infrastructure.
Japan has woken up, especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, due to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
Single step
Flows were placed in the hands of the internal market when yen - Japanese currency - became one of the "saved values" for investors fleeing the debt crisis from the euro area and the worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but at the same time a great burden for export companies.
With stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for the country whose economy is driven by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony added their weak results in July until September just the yen course.
While markets continue to occupy EU border countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is cautious.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of certain foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid increase of yen," the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And indeed the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) clarified that most Member States showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
A indicator that predicts instability in the world economy has shown that the economy of the main powers is slowing down.
It dropped by four tenths to 100,4 points by 100,8 in August.
The Eurozone even reached the average of 100. It reached a level of 99.13 points.
Athens Again Spreads Uncertainty
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but no written commitment will be signed by the Conservatives
With the fast and risky coastal guarantees and the uncertainty that again prevailed, Greece is increasingly involved in the labyrinth leading to the outbreak of a major debt crisis in Europe.
The belief that the "judgment" of the new transitional Greek government is given more requirements to Brussels than the true conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday, admitted that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the time of 100 days he received in his appointment would probably be short for their application, the President of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, said that the new, sustainable measures would not be supported in any case and would repeat his requirement to write new elections on the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the summit of 26 October," Papadimos said yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will take place tomorrow by voting on the government's confidence.
A package of 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samarase's message does not explain any doubt about his position: "We have committed ourselves to help the Transitional Government, but we have not committed to anything else."
The President of the Conservatives went a little further to the address of the EU and the IMF. These organisations are going to block the 8 billion Athens urgently needed, but at the same time declared that they would not support and sign any commitments regarding the implementation of the savings measures.
Yesterday, the European Commission, which has already been affected by Papandre's play with the referendum, stressed that its requirements are uninterrupted: it does not unlock any aid unless the new government and the representatives of the main parties sign "a written commitment without duplication and as early as possible".
Talker for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens and will deal with the new government about "what it needs to pay for the sixth part" 8 billion.
The Greek wedding has a moment left of which.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Kingdom raises Spain's main position in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a significant position at world level as regards microfinance".
The Queen of Sofia yesterday recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet, in terms of this instrument of cooperation, whose essence is "that it is a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on trust in man".
Last night, the Queen launched the 5th World Microloan Summit in Valladolid, convinced that "no doubt" that this type of operation "is absolutely necessary" for us to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the targets to achieve a reduction of half the people living with less than one dollar per day, i.e. the amount that sets the threshold for poverty".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsible", highlighted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will continue until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacity and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", which are intended above all.
"We've already reached a lot" and "a lot of challenges are still ahead of us."
The sum of microloans should be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports "fundamental objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the aim was to provide 175 million poor families with access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and to provide 100 million families with access to the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of microloan was extended to Spain and to other countries of the world after "what was issued on this journey by the proponent of Muhammad Yunus", the queen stated and added that it was "an act of justice and necessary recognition".
The father described this tool as a "beautiful idealist who went on the way to fight poverty". She met with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet directly on the spot with his loan policy.
The first worldwide summit in Washington and other meetings, such as the 1999 edge of the island, in Canada, were followed in 2006. "At all these meetings, I was able to detect constant development, explained to the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, served the title "family head", which gave her the "movement of the poor" in Valladolid.
The Queen of Sofia agreed to her speech by calling on the participants to engage in the discussion and search for a solution and thus to continue in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, declared solidarity "is an ethical imperative", which must be governed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said it would be wrong to link cooperation with developing countries only with the period of the balloon, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes microloans are "serious and honest policies to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever before the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to be the victims of crime.
For Spain, microloan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secrets for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to the people who are all closing the door. Mayor Valladolida, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed participants in the city who "opens their gates of the spirit of solidarity which is infectious".
The CDU proposes to elect a European President on the basis of general electoral law
Without serious difficulties for the office and the President of the Christian Democratic Party of Angela Merkel, the first day of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) Congress took place on Monday, November 14.
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but it became until the fall, in particular to be satisfied by the members who consider the government's policy to the Greeks today and perhaps to the Italians as lax tomorrow.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine out of 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.
A few minutes of sheep stands to the conclusion of Angela Merkel's speech and after a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the office and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: it responds to the crisis "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to Europe's office, "the time has come for change".
This could be reflected in the changes in the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of the general electoral law "to give Europe one face".
This is, in any case, one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, which is clearly the inspiration of Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will agree quickly on this revolutionary step: against the British and the leading representatives of the CDU, Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same position.
But the direction is out.
Likewise, delegates rejected a large majority of the proposal to assess the weight of each country in the representation of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which would clearly lead to the strengthening of the weight of Germany.
Headed by the mayor to calm the climate inside his party, the office made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she did not try to obtain a conference talk about the "small" European states or the States that are in difficulty, willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal concerning Europe is one of the main points of the "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
It's just not direct.
When she recalled that two hundred years ago, there was a bloody battle in Lipska.
In fact, it was one of the most obedient defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What is a fraud in the absence of work?
The UMP and the Government of Offensives against Labour Incapacity are released after support.
Nicolas Sarkozy will visit Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Support Authority, where he will address the subject of the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity since 2007.
As a follow-up to this offensive, which is based on the desire to make savings in the context of an increased effort, but is not less clear from the point of view of the presidential campaign, the right majority wants to focus on labour shortages.
First, because of budgetary savings, the government intends to impose on private sector employees a fourth day of disability before they start receiving support in the disease.
Of course, without the agreement of the company, an employee who is sick would lose four days of pay, at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring EUR 280 million.
And also the measures that would be accompanied by other measures of symbolic achievement: to give state employees one day of unrestricted incapacity (to date they have no incapacity against three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the majority of the courts will also raise the subject of frauds aimed at the abuses associated with labour shortages this time.
"The controls will be much more extensive and further: if you arrive, you will return," Xavier Bertrand warned on Sunday 13 November during the conversation with the RTL station.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear to be somewhat inappropriate in view of the truth of irregularities in the event of incapacity for work.
These were actually the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and of the political effort that brought their fruits.
The French are not more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance disease (CNAM - public health insurance) more than €237 million was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, in 2008 daily reimbursements of EUR 11.3 billion accounted for 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount 46% were maternal contributions and labour injuries and 54% were job failures, i.e. €6.2 billion.
So only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to the study by Alma Consulting, France had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average that conceals certain deviations in itself: another survey published in 2007 on the work opportunities pages of Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees questioned responded that no day of disability had been chosen.
Another study, this time carried out by health insurance institutions, explains that in 2010 37.8% of work disabilities were shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% went on.
When we compare them with their European neighbours, French employees are not more prone than elsewhere to incapacity for work.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall absence (for health reasons or not) in France was between 10% and 11.8% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 18% in the Netherlands.
Deception in work disabilities is only a very small part of the opposite of work in black.
As far as deception is concerned, these are only a small amount.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks based on incapacity for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that at 1.5 million controls, 13.8% of 285,000 were performed due to short-term incapacity for "unauthorized or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematicly controlled disabilities for more than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadapted or unauthorized" were counted at 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 "unjusted" cases for several million employees who had disabilities.
The number that represents much less than the number of job-declaring black.
According to MP Dominiquea Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent 9 to 15 billion euros missing in the selection of taxes per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and thus infinitely more than the frauds associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to restore its economy.
On Monday 14 December, the Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, delivered those words to Parliament and added that a hundred days given to his government of the unit would not be sufficient to carry out this task.
"In order to put our economy back on foot, we need support from our European partners and a new saving budget plan," the head of government said when he found his first public speech on Wednesday at the beginning of the vote on confidence in Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the eurozone summit will be the "main task" of the new government, as it added the participation of our country in the eurozone.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit would be "in around 9%" of the gross domestic product from now on to the end of the year after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right to refuse new rescue measures
Mr Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support on Monday with a view to trying to avoid the debt crisis, but noting that his party is not committed to any further supportive measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras stressed at the meeting with the MPs on his side of New Democracy.
We have voted against the targets for reducing deficits and debt and combating flooding, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Ollim Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the required loan of EUR 8 billion without the written guarantee of all the parties supporting the proposed measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, the committee of experts says
According to the report of the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians are killed.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Canadian society is living with the idea of reopening death.
Only 9% of Canadians really accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and take a decision in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of a comprehensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in different areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Commission recommends that the Government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, if that choice appears to be necessary in a patient considered competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning, experts quote a recent survey by the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
Although Canada is 10th place, the study notes that "medication of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, experts tell us with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And through the desire to die at home, which has most Canadians, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to all of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this number is highest with 86% of the people who died in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the reports come to the conclusion that they are opposed to the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide does not want to change anything.
According to experts who have also subject to the control of all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered to be criminal, there is no evidence that this criminalisation is causing any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide against persons who do not belong or consent to it.
On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, the co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday at the teleconference more than many cases of these seizures in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are attracted to euthanasia
Consider that according to an Angus Reid's 2010 survey, 85% of Canadians have already expressed themselves in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it will enable people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the lives of old or disabled people have a lower price.
With regard to persons engaged in assisted suicide, 41% of the respondents consider that they should not be reached in court.
In the case of maintenance or interruption of patient care, the situation is less clear, reports authors say.
The list of recommendations also suggests that criminal law states that the withdrawal from the treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not punishable.
The Commission of Experts also requires that professionals be trained to respect the obligation to refuse treatment at the end of their life without fear of criminal harassment.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final comfort already widely used in Canadian medical devices, the Commission requires that it be considered at a time when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain, euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Rewards of other experts
Some medical experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the Royal Canadian Society of Experts.
Mr Pierre Descamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of the experts-signatories of the report as "extreme" among other things because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia at the terminal stage.
"This opens the door to a situation when anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old could ask for help in committing suicide," says Pierre Descamps, who was studying the summary news yesterday.
P. Descamps also underlines that it seems as if the authors of the reports built autonomy of persons above all the other values that form the social preoccupation of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
Medical Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, himself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, is particularly doubtful about the data on the absence of doubts in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the United States of America.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Resign
The lady is talking about "complexity."
Syria is more isolated than ever
Yesterday, the Bashar al-Assad officials protested before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria were intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who with Russia's support resists and talks about "complexity" against his country.
Two days after Syria's membership in the League of Arab States was suspended, the European Union imposed its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, took a stand in favour of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was yesterday the first ruler of the Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to kill in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the military forces of the regime were killed "before power".
"If Bashar had any interest in his country, he would have to give a demise, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said King Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
On the other hand, Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu said that the efforts devoted to Turkish mediation in the Syrian regime that had been undertaken since the beginning of the year had not been crowned with success.
"Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave" said with an attack on neighbouring Syria, which Turkey applies as far as the harder line continues.
The United States was pleased to see "strengthen consensus against Assad and the unfair treatment of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, the countries like Turkey are applying as much hard as possible" against repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As the Syrian Human Rights Observer announced, 16 civilians and 19 members of the regime were killed in the city of Dera in southern Syria during this time.
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed "by gunshots and concentrated shooting from heavy bullets in the city of Jobar" in the area of Homs.
However, during the press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Valid Moual, estimated that the country "was on its way out of the crisis".
He also responded to the decision of the League of Arab States to suspend the membership of Damascus, which he considered to be a "dangerous step".
Syria "does not agree", added with the assurance that "complaints against Syria do not succeed".
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering "the mechanism for the protection of civilians" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is also welcome the idea of sending United Nations observers to help protect civilians against the repression of the regime, which according to him is "paranoid".
The new special meeting of the League will be called to Rabat tomorrow to raise its opinion on the plan for a resolution of the crisis, which was decided on 2 December and which specifically envisaged the deployment of armed forces from the cities of armed conflict and the release of prisoners of war.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered yesterday the decision of the League of Arab States to be "missible", while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while protecting itself completely from any sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifices for Italy
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked for the markets for a little time to be able to design his team and start applying a program that will contain "victims" in order to regain the credibility of the Berlusconi government in recent months.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting with representatives of experts and employers.
A relatively smooth cabinet consisting of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties should be set up.
"Monti talked about an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of a large parliamentary group of participants in the talks, after meeting with the appointed Prime Minister.
The president of the Gianfranco Fini Embassy expects Mario Monti to request a statement of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti presenting a small team of twelve ministers of President Giorgi Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented nervously on the financial markets yesterday and asked for time.
In "democracy is subject to precise deadlines" with regard to the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed and added that he was sure that markets would be patient and understanding.
His appointment as President was initially favourable, but anxiety reappeared after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team of technocrats in particular, although he stressed that he would like to adopt "politics".
He expressed his conviction that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to President Gianfranca Fini, the new government will receive Parliament's trust by Friday.
Mario Monti promised to act with extraordinary urgency and with a view to re-establishing Italy as a strong article in Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's speech stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change with the new government".
The European Union is convinced that, despite the difficult plans adopted by Rome in recent months, it will not achieve its objective, which is balanced in the 2013 budget, and calls for a new firm measure.
The head of the conf industry Emma Marcegagliová, which meets with Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to revitalize the economy "because a country that does not show growth cannot comply with the deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence "professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the "responsibility challenge" and "other Italy", is a "local change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism".
A great stranger will be the time of life for his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid the early elections, as Italy has to place public bonds by April 2012 for EUR 200 billion.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator used for nuclear weapons, announced in Tuesday American non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents that have been excluded from this UN agency.
Last week, MAAE announced its "serious concern" with regard to the "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS Institute of Widespread Exploitation of MAAE by V. Danilenko (nar. 1934), he had been working three decades since the 1960s in the Soviet Military Research Centre in Čeljabinsk (Ural), where he was to be involved in the production of synthetic diamonds by means of an explosion method.
In 1989 or 1991 he had to leave the centre to set up a "nano-diamanty" company in Kyiv.
His company's economic difficulties should have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he was to cooperate with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, MAAE recalls "clear data that the development of the detonation system implemented by Iran" came from "the work of a foreign specialist who did not only know this method well, but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked during a substantial part of his work career on this technology within the country's military nuclear programme from".
Protimism crime and crime rates by 50%
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of crimes and crimes directed against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence declined slightly or slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% of the increase against the 13% in Catholic violence, 4% in Jewish violations and 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "objective criminal acts" was very easily up to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which according to the FBI were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
"After the fall in 2009, it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and decency to rise again," the Human Rights First organization, focusing on human rights, stressed, "the growth of anti-Muslim violence is particularly important", added the organization in its communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one of Paul Legendre's leaders.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these crimes," it adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports on "individual crime".
The "individual criminal act" in American federal law is the legacy of the time of the fight for civil law.
This rule of law was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence associated with race, colour of skin, religion, origin and now and sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and likes more Facebook
The Twitter microblogging service page introduced a design change on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of its followers, somewhat similar to its Facebook services.
New offers "activities" and "name" allow you to better and know the activities of other people who follow you or those whose answers ("tweets") you follow.
This allows you to know if they allow you to watch contributions, sign up for new accounts, have your favorite contributions, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August at a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, AFP spokesperson for Twitter Carolyn Penner said.
Twitter, which was familiar with its little instinctive function, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for repeated expansion of someone else's contribution, followfriday to recommend de follow another user) making the bonheur des initís, so opens a wider audience with a more comparable handling of the des reseaus grand public Facebook and Google+.
On the network users immediately in their "tweets" they respect the importance of this innovation.
"It's unnecessary, it takes a lot of places and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Working will help me better watch some elements of my Twitter," he sent @danykronstrom.
Austria
recording of the Golden Rule on the Balanced Budget in the Constitution
The government of the large coalition of social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write down the "bad rule" budget policies in the institution with a view to reducing the public deficit and avoiding the possible reduction of the assessment of Austria by rating agencies (AAA).
It was the very Social-Democratic Office Werner Faymann who announced this decision at the conclusion of the Council of Ministers in a situation where the Austrian public debt is 74.6% high above the criteria set by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay every year for three billion euros more," argued the multi-officer and foreign minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindeleger.
Austria thus insists on the request of the Eurozone summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State or Government strongly requested that the reduction of public deficit and the achievement of public accounts balance be recorded in the Constitution or in the law by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to be reduced every year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (HDP) and beginning in 2017 the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be expected to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the country as well as the municipalities will have to show a balanced budget.
The objective is to achieve public debt under the 60% criterion of the Maastricht Treaty in 2020/21.
Strong only
The node threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese institutions would have to re-enter foreign exchange markets if only to continue in force.
"Let's focus on how we've done it lately, if we find too much uncertainty" in the exchange course alone, he explained to Senator Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, only again came the historic values that the Japanese authorities had brought to the intervention on October 31st.
That day, Tokyo sold only for dollars to reduce the value of Japanese currency, which had recently exceeded the record of the dollar in force since 1945.
But only since then has there been a regular step in supporting the purchases of investors who consider it a "safe port" in the unreal times of global economic slowdown and a European debt crisis.
The dollar came back on Tuesday under 77 yen and the euro went down under a symbolic summer of 105 yen to the close of the level that led to the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar had about 120 yen and more than 160 yen.
This development of Japanese currencies damages island exports because it distorts the price of the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of the revenues obtained by Japanese companies from abroad when they transfer them to domestic currency.
"Japan recovers" from the disappearance caused by the March earthquake and wave of tsunamis that devastated the region of Tohok in the north-east of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who is afraid that this tragedy will not kill only in the island of the cross-resurrection.
The third economic power of the world has restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% in view of the previous quarter) and first in one year thanks to the export growth survey and household consumption of disasters.
But the Prime Minister felt that the high value did not reflect the "national economy of Japan".
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which started its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to adopt all possible measures leading to the weakening of only one.
But the governor of this institution Hirohide Yamaguchi pointed out that BoJ had already adopted a "participative measure" indicating that no additional monetary weakness could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Emissions Institution increased by EUR 5,000 billion (EUR 47 billion) its purchases of State Treasury notes and increased to EUR 55,000 billion (519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts devoted to the purchases of various securities to float with liquids.
Eurozone:
rates rise, storms decline
The risk of the debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth numbers in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
The European storms still worrying about the stability of the eurozone are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris in 10 hours the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt is losing 0.4% and 0.1% in London.
"With new tensions around the revenues from eurozone countries that are in difficulties, markets with stocks around the world continue to produce only a fraction of the recent profits."
"Nurable investors are only too aware of the risk of injury," explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets broker, quoted by Reuters.
The stock exchange in Tokyo closed with a decrease of 0.7%, which suffered from the fears of market participants about Europe's ability to cope with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe, and the change will only continue in the narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyosi Investment Management.
This re-starting does not affect the future of the eurozone itself, which continues in its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is reached at the lowest level from one month and a half ago.
Within 10 hours, the European currency has a value of $1.3570 at 0.4%.
According to the money brokers, after the CDU's party, Angela Merkelova, at its congress, adopted a proposal on Monday, which provides for the possibility of leaving the eurozone for countries experiencing difficulties without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
The interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning, the output of the Italian ten-year bonds is 6.85% and the output of the Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of South European countries, but also in France, continue to exacerbate the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded time in the markets to correct the situation in Italy threatened by the alarming rise in its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the eurozone summit will be his government's "main task".
Spain is once again in the targeted direct market when the country's elections to the parliament are held on Sunday.
The difference in interest ("spread") between Germany and Spain's ten-year bonds reached a new historical maximum.
Expecting the number of reporting growth in the eurozone
Statistical figures say that France recorded economic growth in the third quarter of the year by 0.4% due mainly to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth by 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Study INSEE revised the number below for the second quarter by 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And the truth is, it's the fourth quarter that the economies worry the most.
Germany has recorded an increase of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 hours, while the European Commission has just pointed out the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must win over dogmats
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term differences or emotions, then it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is natural that the election meeting would be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only succeed when all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development is calling for a double demand for electricity from 2050 to 2050, if we don't want a significant part of the world's population to get rid of the important components of life.
At the same time, we will have to face the lack of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity, and we cannot forget the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a view to combating climate change, which is the subject that is currently emerging from the ecological debate.
An accident in Fukushima has no effect on any of these parameters.
And that's why Germany is left alone in its decision to refuse nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case of Belgium, which subjugates its decision to find some other resource capable of replacing itself, nor Switzerland, which considers to be the right building only the last generation of electricity.
On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue to make a decision in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to extend its park to one unit by rebuilding the construction of one power plant interrupted by the Three Mile Island power plant.
If the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, reality resists it.
The Berlin election is reflected in the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of electricity on land gas and coal.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves us to think about it.
The European champion in wind power plants, from which 30% of its electricity is taken, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularity, which is why CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices are higher than the European average by 65%, or 50%.
On the contrary, due to the uncertainty of our energy policy, our neighbor's electricity bill will pay 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While in a globalised economy, energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and the guarantee of maintaining the industry in the national territory, the French companies enjoy the advantages of the most expensive electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make the illustrative beautiful declaration of the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price, which most of the French refuse to pay, is as much as it is essentially not against this energy, as the public opinion surveys show.
Remember, our country's energy policy has enabled the sector to build 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 jobs.
A strong export sector will attract a large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises that create jobs that cannot be transferred abroad to the international market.
If France had decided to abandon the core, it would have sacrificed a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have reached EUR 6 billion per year, which the country earns for exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which owner of the power plant would order a nuclear reactor designed to function for 60 years while planning to fail its manufacturer?
In resolving the energy equation, it should be admitted that there is no magic source for energy production, because there is no devil.
The development of low-carbon installations, nuclear installations and renewable energy installations implemented by the French industrial group AREVA shall bear witness to the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the National Nuclear Safety Authority, which performs non-compromising and transparent supervision over existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionality is recognized, have a sense of safety in the blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry experienced three serious accidents.
The only thing that happened in the Three Mile Island was under normal operating conditions and left without human victims and consequences for the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama caused the concept of a reactor and unexplainable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, it seems that some forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused tens of thousands of deaths.
The nuclear industry will take lessons from this accident just as it did in the two previous years.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and constructors is that the EPR-type reactor represents a concept capable of coping with such phenomena.
While all those who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it to be a great gift to the competitors of the AREVA group and EDF and to pave the way for a stronger position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machines control the debate so crucial for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised for various purposes - the payment of police, courts and administratively detailed policies of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "human rights country", which France boasts.
It was a recent administrative complaint, the object of which was foreign students, which became current when the Minister of Interior (see Libération List of 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, gardeners and servants".
But so far, it was only a few times in the corner of the economy.
It must be said that in this area there is quite a broad agreement between the left and the right.
That's exactly what Jacques Chirac said in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million migrant workers" and on the left of Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "could not accept all the world's demands".
The only difference is the degree of greatness
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the hordes of Polish installers in the French territory was shared both on the left and on the left.
In both camps immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is to the degree of greatness that we will be reluctant to provide to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande restricts his banality when it turns out that joint development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work summarizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, page 352): there is a broad consensus between specialists on the positive impact of migration on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that immigrants accept.
Limitation of immigration is conducive to growth and employment damage.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that immigrants are actually much more complementary than substitutes for French employees by doing work in sectors with a lack of employees.
A few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not accept French employees and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is insufficient to provide jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Like a surgeon, there will be difficulties with work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between France and migrants cause immigrants' incomes to have a positive effect on wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that the growth of migration by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
However, the fact that the variety of immigrants brought contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prize holders; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded).
Migrants are also the net contributors of social systems in European countries, on average, at 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that in Germany one immigrant will bring a net contribution to public budgets at the age of 30 (acceptance of less expenditure) of EUR 150000 for his entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed at the beginning of his mandate his desire to come for the missing percentage of growth with "depreciated teeth".
The said teeth used to detect immigrants had a very different effect.
Europe has invented democracy, left to think of European democracy
Democracy is rare and also very fragile goods.
The European continent should remember this, although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, during the 20th century the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, holocaust, gulags, but also Franca in Spain, Salazara in Portugal and Colonels in Greece.
Some people could have believed that if democracy finally triumphed over its enemies, it would be enough to make the choice and implement it as direct as possible.
But it's already known from Napoleon that it was the ease of thinking.
General electoral law, although necessary for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become "a tool for printing" as Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of division and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is precisely from the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
The recognition of the Greek rapporteur's error of type yes-no will have in this respect the value of double detection: the need for a great return of political power, but also the detection of the disturbing feeling of his inability, his inconsistencies.
This ambiance must be considered in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front line of the democratic army has moved today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
There is nothing we can get if we demand a number of national referendums organized according to necessity and disorganized.
White exposed to the European absolute monarch or jump with tied legs to an empty nationalist depth: what a choice for citizens!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full, peaceful and uninterrupted exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor do we know where to stop the bill - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is, therefore, a whole Europe that is committed to the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its inability and lack of solidarity.
This is the whole of Europe, which is humiliated on the international stage.
We are disturbed by the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is a whole Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it all its nations.
It is urgent to return to the management of the European democratic governance project.
Because only together will the Europeans be able to reduce their debt burden, rid themselves of the governments of markets and prepare the future by investment.
The outcome of the crisis will provide for a decision at European level which cannot be adopted without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it will lead us to a pitfall.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, all of us today are urgently demanding the European economic government.
Wake up.
But think about it without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be a new madness and a new blind street.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" Republicans.
The revolution in interest couldn't suffice.
This lesson continues to apply.
We must build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This can only be done by building Europe more politically democratic and truly European democratic excellence.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Unplugged" digital cards are spreading
In the optimistic atmosphere will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris, the world fair of chip carts.
In 2011, according to Eurosmart’s office, it is expected to end up increasing global sales of micro-processor cards (bank cards, SIM cards) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most portable is a wireless technology segment that allows you to pay in public transportation or to purchase only by approaching the card to the reader.
This year should be sold worldwide 460 million chip carts against 320 million sales a year earlier!
In 2012, their share should still rise (expected at 580 million units) and reach about 10% of the total market with chips (6,925 million cards).
After a long time in the way of APEC countries, Europe is gaining an area in a non-contact payment.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, the beginnings are smaller: 400,000 wireless tickets have been issued.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour has spent 2.5 million wireless pass cards this year.
To draw up a higher speed level, it is necessary to have their customers equipped from now on.
"Two large French companies have undertaken to distribute systematically in the future to their clients a free bank card," says Gérard Nebouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Pay Mobile
But that's just the first step towards the means of payment for the future: the mobile phone.
NFC (Near Field Communication) technology is only a small number of devices available today.
"They're late."
"But to their true mind should come next year."
"For 2012, we estimate their worldwide sales to between 80 million and 120 million," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already getting ready.
The Bank of Crédit farmers announced yesterday that the test carried out in Caen would take place from December to June next year.
About 200 iPhone devices and collaborators will be equipped with an exclusive wireless payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Also, the Société General announced yesterday that he was preparing to introduce an offer allowing her clients to pay on the mobile phone without delay.
The terrorist front goes from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-term suspicion that there are links between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram is confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria had "no security" since now.
"The way both organisations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is great cooperation between them," he explained without further clarification.
It seems that Paris has similar analyses.
The investigation of the abduction of two French in Niger in January 2010 could help to shed light on the connecting bridges.
After AQMI members were taken from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their abductions during the operation by special French units.
In the morning after the raid, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
An analysis of the calls made leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are especially interested in two numbers: one leads to Nigeria, which lived in Maiduguri, a town on the north of Nigeria, the collegiate of Boko Haram, and the other to a person who is said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
"It's progress, but there's no doubt to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more active," Nigeria's researcher Kunle Amuwo said.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in the development and performance of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which now include human victims or an increasingly complex explosive device of the same manner of implementation as the devices used by AQMI.
The international community in front of Washington has since developed pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems caused by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be of little interest to the community of mystics.
Fast success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, schools and fundamentalists of Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in Haoussa language means "Western education is a sin", approves the establishment of Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection is a quick success.
The sect is politicized and requires strict respect for Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters are starting the fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram's ranks became extremely active and fuelled their attacks on police stations.
The government's response is, as usual, still the same.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of Mohammed Joseph's sect is arrested and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its place in the north.
On Christmas 2010, he will carry out an assassination in Jos, where 80 people will be killed, followed by another in the capital of Abuja.
In June it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police commander in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the United Nations local government will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania across Nigeria to Somalia, is now disturbing all security specialists.
Now, when Al-Qaeda of Islamic Maghreb surrounded Mali and the games and Somalis from the Al-Shabab movement operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppe said that France is in a state of emergency and is ready to "deliver all the information".
The World According to the President's Candidates
In matters relating to China, Iran or Israel's assistance to Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry, they are precipitated in simplification and ignorance.
Can America's weakened crisis manage the world by using simple or even simplifying ideas?
At the hearing of the presidential candidates, the voters might think so.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have repeated a flairy statement and brief statements on foreign policy, which is already a traditionally strong point of the Republic.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran or the help of Israel are among them.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate for the "Grand Old Party" race, threatened by the Chinese's call against the World Trade Organization and their accusation "for manipulation of their currency", which is a heavy theme in America for the deliberate migration of all parts of its industry towards Asia.
It's worse if this has to contain the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former Ambassador of Obama to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost collapsed in a position that "stirred" emotion.
He demanded a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who's in the last seats in the polling stations, remains unheard of.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes to Iran if they failed to pass the sanctions in stopping his nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll arrest Iran," said fanfaron.
"If Obama is elected again, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase Israel's military assistance, accusing Obama of failing in his duties to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of documents.
Recently he called for a strong attitude against the Chinese military threat, because Beijing "trys to develop nuclear capacities" - obviously unknown fact that China has been its own nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who is supporting Israel and wants to strike against Iran, says he is ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate Michele Bachmann.
They are all far away from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say Reagan also had simple thoughts and yet won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the cancelled departure of "boys" from Iraq, his excuses concerning Libya, and thus attach a weak label to him.
But the attack isn't easy.
The population assesses President Obama's national security policy, which has removed Ben Ladina, more positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military attacks that lead to a coup.
And with the arguments that it is necessary to rebuild America economically in order to be able to reinvigorate its leading position, Obama knelt at the right place.
Nord Stream, new entrance port of Russian gas to Europe
The far-off Nord Stream pipeline connecting Eastern Europe to Russia and led after the Baltic Sea began to function.
It has to add gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, Russian gas station, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the opening of Nord Stream last Tuesday, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly to the sea.
The symbolically German office of Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitrij Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together with a control valve to drive Russian gas into the Western European network.
This new pipeline starts to flow to Western Europe 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas per year with first pipelines of 1,224 km of Petrohrad with the Mecklenburg-Omaryan country.
The second pipeline to be completed at the end of 2012 will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is a quantity equal to the total French consumption.
And it is already reminded of the possibility of building a third pipeline pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the temporary completion of this huge building has the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested against the project.
Nord Stream will in fact be able to supply gas directly to Germany without being led through the country by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
The reverse of these two countries is losing some power: the possibility of pressing on Russia's threats of closing its access to Western European markets becomes more difficult for them.
The most powerful statement was made by Warsaw when she did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-World Pact", with the withdrawal of the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means that it's a politically sensitive topic.
Western Europe has gained greater confidence in its purchases by supporting this Russian project.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project created trades between Europeans from the east and the west.
Russia managed to launch its vision of a direct relationship between Russia and the rich Western states with high gas consumption, which is close to its end.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new carpet that organically connects us," said François Fillon at the celebration of opening this pipeline and demonstrating the point where large gas contracts are both political and economic.
This explains all the wide smiles of the leading representatives of Gazprom present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas pipeline.
The construction of this pipeline is also a significant technical activity.
The sea pipe is made of steel fitted with a concrete plate to protect it from sea anchors.
It is located at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
His building needed to be avoided by a mine field from the time of World War II.
"Because of their safety, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, a spokesperson for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to impose measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The single tube is a long metal snake of 242 Eiffeliev, which has never been interrupted by valves or maintenance stations for all its lengths.
One control area was to be built near Sweden, but the leading project was rejected when the Swedish were only a little eager to see the Russian state’s company, as it continued to settle on their coasts.
"In the event of a dispute, we will stop the flow of gas in less than 1 minute," explains Jens Müller.
In the event of uncertainty, the gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered to be unlikely by the wearer, since the weights were designed to produce the discomfort once in 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the pipeline outside shall be carried out by the underwater robot towed ship while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device circulating inside.
This tube-shaped device with a diameter of 1 m is inserted inside the tube and is pressed by gas.
For the purpose of three-day journeys, the 3 m/s shall provide accurate information on any distortions of the metal parts.
The remote pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without the need for a smaller repair.
Gas circulation is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the target.
In order to implement this project, five companies have joined forces.
The lead position remains Gazproma, which holds a 51% stake.
It was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream, entrusted with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company has a residence in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely beneficial.
As a result, Gazprom leased all its capacity for gas transport for five years, which can be renewed.
"Gazprom will have a total capacity profit, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," explains Jens Müller.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was provided by 30% of shareholders and by 70% of bank loans.
Total labour costs should reach EUR 7.4 billion for both pipes.
For the GDF Suez group, investment costs amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be returned because they take the risk to themselves only Gazprom.
The pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sand coast with borovic forests.
The valves at a height of 4.5 meters form the exhaust gate.
The sensors shall measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the gas coming before being transported to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal accepts one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
With full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - Tagger
The Italian company Moleskina, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to re-supply the writing.
It brings the flavor of adventure, an hour spent writing at the light of the candle.
The writer of Moleskine is easily discernible by his black edgeboards and his leaves sent white colors as if they were old times.
The writer of Moleskin, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Modo, based in Milan, will then decide to introduce a new design but distinguished writer on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, takes note of the introduction of the new product.
The pen is inspired by the old manufacturing technique "moleskin" (skin imitation), which is used, for example, to modify the surface of the wallet.
This type of writer was highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has returned to the shape of an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leading person of the fashion company.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% to settle at 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is a remote hidden production from the first years when only 3,000 recorders were produced.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It's hard to put together some artistic portrait of the buyer, because the writer will take on the meaning of the work as well as students or professionals.
The image of the writer of Moleskine is that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultivation and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now has nearly a hundred and has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York since 2008.
He sends his writers to the bookstore and through the FNAC chain to small shops in the middle of cities where he was able to spread his identity.
"We have followed the spirit of the times and this need for a new writing, through the stormy development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of the writer Moleskine: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Acházka", where architects or artists present their writer.
In August, at a film festival in Locarn, she also introduced a new desk for the writer, reminding Leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifys its products: bags, diaries, bags, stamps on notebooks ... The brand expands on a whole range of carriers.
The success that sparked addiction: in autumn 2006 Mode Mode was bought by the investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today, the 15th week for the employment of disabled people is open.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed people is twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is that adorable?
"No, it's up to Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adaptive Association, who organizes the Week for the Employment of Handicapped."
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, there wasn't a percentage of unemployed twice, but three times higher."
"There's still a lot left to do."
It should be said that for unemployed disabled persons there are frequent obstacles to their entry into work.
This is the elderly person: 37% is over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not qualify and of the 2.3 million students in high schools, only 10,000 are disabled.
And finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% of the disabled versus 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to employment and which are the core of the problem, according to Christiana Grapina, Director General of the Tremplin Association, which was established in 1992 to help businesses to accept disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There's no such thing as a way of thinking that's definitely developing, but too slow.
The study conducted in April IMS-Entrepreneurre pour la Cité found that questionnaire managers have a "low level of knowledge about disabled persons" with an "excessive idea of persons on a wheelchair and mental or mental disability".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the goals of employing 6% of disabled workers laid down in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures coming from 2008 show an equal rate of 2.6%.
"Now we're moving around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph's organization, responsible for collecting fees from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence is the number of "acquired" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011 of 59,000 of the provincial enterprises to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large businesses."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with between 20 and 49 employees employ handicrafted workers against 82% of enterprises with between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "What luck"
Before Tuesday evening (20h45), French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly competition will bring them.
We don't go that far to write that there was a relationship between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to themselves at the stadium view of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard were briefly and well directed.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the fight against Turkey, a Belgian coach found only words of praise to his player.
"I am with Eden and his progress is very happy, and the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," assures the French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national men's matches, "that's the same, it's justifiable."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my badge."
Hazard, who was investigating Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "warn".
You can't mention the term "rejoice".
To play against Bleus, who has encouraged them for 7 years and in their winning prizes in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
More than that, because they are "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"We crossed right now."
"He can play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Kindly, Leekens even mentioned pride.
"Her pride" to fight a "saint" -- a holiday.
"Hrodost" is also found in the quality of "socieds", that France has become a very high-level team once more than a year after trauma in the South African city of Knysna."
"Laurent Blanc has done a great deal of work," he sighed.
Although Belgium will miss the next European championship, a technical footballer would like to see in 2014 in a plane with France direction... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will grow big," he said.
"We're just building something, players are ambitious, they're healthy hungry."
"You'll realize it for the next fights." including against France.
Portugal is very self-aware
The Portuguese watch Paulo Bento begins with a great optimism barge against Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there were both teams missing realism.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese football representation, with its cormorant since 2010, is qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is in fact sharing 90 minutes.
There is one match left and one opponent - Bosnia.
In the knowledge of the Friday result (0-0) in the Bosnian Zenice hell, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour's worth of weight, but it was not able to give such a rare goal that would catch him.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk in itself, because we didn't go out."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon the Portuguese are convinced that they will appear before the audience, who should create a burning boiler there, even though the game will certainly appear to be "very balanced", says the optimist, but rather considerive Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are fully convinced that we can have a top," said a Portuguese coach for twenty-four years.
"We still have 50% chance to be on the Euro 2012," relativized the successor Carlos Queiroze.
An indecisive Friday game in Bosnia forces Portugal to score and win.
An indecisive match can be enough for the Bosnians who also need to target.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk in itself, because we didn't go out," says Bento.
"We'll be playing against a team that has great technical qualities and that has players with great individual qualities," he added.
Like in Zenica, Portugal will be interested in developing the Bosnian team immediately from the beginning to the maximum pressure so that "they don't have time to think."
A good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
