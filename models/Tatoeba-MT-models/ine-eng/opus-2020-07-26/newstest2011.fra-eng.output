What's going to happen? CSSD knew neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new members of CSSD at the capital mayor's office will appear to have to overcome a real language barrier to understand themselves at the municipal council level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, i.e. whether they knew the argument that was born during the last years in the womb, when they were the partners of the current coalition leading to Prague.
The vocabulary coded that Prague's political crème set in motion during the previous century of Major Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new voters do not understand well the known terms.
At least they say it.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a gentleman in Prague politics who responded to Lukas Kaucky, the choice to culture in the "pararain" vocabulary test.
And with regard to the political veteran, elected Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the sense of golf.
"It's the only expression you offer me to use"
Otherwise, I don't use the argument.
From the vocabulary, whose daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-sectoral congress of the ODS, the editor chose 6 examples, in priority those associated with the Prague Mayor.
Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the pastry, "boeuf nerve", "trahison of the capital" and "toler".
Three of the elected members agreed for the Quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not decline the phone.
The fifth election Petr Dolinek firmly refused the test.
"I don't care about all of this and how the representatives of civil democracy have fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with how we will understand our programmes," he said.
As we have already heard, the Eluskas Kaucky did not appear to recognize in the legend above, that it is the influence of Janousek on entrepreneurs and friends of former Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he has become in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky says and immediately adds, "But I know the papers."
"I'm gonna have to pay for a language course," he said.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the environmental elite, know that the golf hole is Blanko's tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who is actually Voldemort and Lukas Plachy know where to find the character - he thinks of "go to the pastry".
"This is, I think, going to a company," Plachy is ready to assume that it is the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
At the same time, your Brezina recalls that he takes his knowledge out of newspapers rather than from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests, there is no lexical argument in social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues and it turns out that we really didn't have anything like this."
"The names are used sometimes for abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, president of the Socio-Democratic Party, as members of the Party call Hulda.
"He called me Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that, says Karel Brezina about nicknames.
Actuel.cz daily tested the name and it works.
Elu Weinert is Papy for members of the Party or even the least friendly Little old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by the scrokering during the party's sponsoring, is named "the little game".
Surnames are also the only ones that allow to use social-democratics inside the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda very much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in math law" he recalls it appears that Petr Hulinsky got his title as a doctor in law JUDr.at the bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "sorceres", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women who are known to be sorceress have common traits.
They are part of the old generation, for example, they cannot work for health reasons, they are free and they have no children.
The one that becomes "sorcière" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man rarely has that destiny."
"We no longer judge young women in good health because they participate in work and receive children," says a sister who is in charge of the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to take action against this unusual "social measure".
He published a brochure that should help to limit the hunting of the sorceress.
The case includes a "hec."
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso don't know how to read," said the daily Die Standard about the inconvenience of written education.
The case of sorceress is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbor of Burkina Faso, Amy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman was killed after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with the oil they had sprinkled on her.
It's the BBC server who sent this information.
The criminals say it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves the ritual onions burned into the woman's contact.
The oil flashed, it appeared, when the team wanted to "hunt the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of the "sources" is approved by people at all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: "The eating of human spirits has always represented a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the hunt to the sorceries, Gambia did not see itself participating in the event last year.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, has launched a wide hunt against the witches who, apparently, would have participated in his death and would be forced by the black magic to kill the President as well."
"From the bells of Guinea near the rescue, they brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of policemen and the personal guard of the President, of the men and women selected at random from the villages of Gambia," said the organization "Amnesty International in a message.
On the farm, prisoners had to drink a plant-based potion with hallucinogenic effects that added to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
The international pressure is about a thousand people who were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The hot chickens, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out from the RPG Byty customer centre of the "carbon baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his son, his daughter, and his son, who was going to have a penalty.
The deregulation has increased the rent to these three persons.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to settle from next year for a second category 2+1 apartment 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and heating works on solid fuel," shows the finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed it anyway" explains t he for reasons of anger and half-resigned.
The Citizen Association of BytyOKD.cz apartments, which described the new conditions of rental as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But man reacts to it by a gesture of his hand.
"One said this, the other said the other thing" by cutting the spikes.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After New Year, this is what most of the apartments in the Czech Republic do not meet the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09 a.m.
Right next to the door is a guard of a security company with a device to call the customers.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
A single pressure and paper with a number out of the device.
You don't have time to read your "157" number that your number is already starting to light up on the big screen under the roof of the waiting room.
In a second it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple comes to learn about the rent, but the new rents don't seem to concern people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to resolve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 RPG portfolio apartments receive mails with new dance contracts in their mailbox to letters since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers increases in rent from 15 to 38 percent.
the special ticket for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still trying" answers, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the guicette when the customer presents himself as a journalist.
The deragulation and former Bakal minor apartments are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and the origin of the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of Socialist Democrats has made this a fairly supportive statement before the elections and now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new planner."
"They didn't even change me a little bit...in the toilet floor, relax in the introduction of the man mentioned.
However, it is mainly the opinion of employees that retirements come to ensure that they will receive a return on the new rental price if they now sign as promised by the RPG in a special offer.
It is a return of half the amount of the rent that the other tenants will receive who will have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregulation" of Havirovaska Street is not really covered by questions.
"Parmi the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent," says the employee in the guichet.
And yet, RPG is posing both on its website and in the windows of individual rental interviews when necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, it is an independent court that will take the decision.
'It is not a threat but only to inform about the unique and legitimate way in which to act legally', says RPG on its website.
"No one will be in court here" thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man in the street in front of the client centre gives him reason.
"I have 13,000 pension crowns and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait," she says.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"In addition, current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the resident portfolio of RPG Byty, who is just the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest with tenants in 4 billion apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014, this should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen increases to the ceiling in front of the refurbished faucets of the Havirosvka Street waiting room, however, repeats some of the information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and covers no less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments.'
"And this will always be up to 7.50 Czech crowns per month," says the screen.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a very low amount of 19.66 Czech crowns to m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not result in a radical but progressive increase of 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rent (cf. the graph) is given to apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase in rent have priority.
The maternal school is part of, too, offices including architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that it also opens a mother's mini school with everything you need - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a mini-game field on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch. design employees can be brought in.
Arch. Design. The company of architectural projects, whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini-maternal business school since the first constructions of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially children, and it was important for women architects and project managers to be able to return to work quickly.
At the same time as low-time employment contracts, the maternal school is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. within the framework of its social program.
Manufacturers and architects thus have the opportunity to take care of children.
They are the employees of Arch.Design.they themselves who have imagined this motherly school and with the support of the management they have been able to obtain an allocation from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mother's school is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme of Human Resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Through funding (up to 2.8 billion Czech crowns), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years to provide qualified staff and road transport.
After using funding (two years) Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to make the mother's mini school operate on its own funds.
The project's preparation lasted a year and it's the Economy rating company that helped make the application.
Childcare is provided by a qualified staff, a nursing nurse and a nurse take care of children all day. Children can go to maternity school without age limits but they have more than three incentives most.
As it is a "mini maternal school", there may be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there is more to be replaced.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school regardless of the hierarchical position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the programme of the elementary school is comparable to that of pre-school education.
Children only play but a quality education is also assured - from the beginning to the preparation of schools to English.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and do not have the stress of a delay in looking for children in a school away from their parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer is created.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among companies that offer a choice bonus for recruiting new employees and that are friendly to the family and through this program enhances the marketing of HRs.
The ossuary house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look inside Gaudi.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric saurien, the staircase to a spine of dinosaurs and balconies to open fish guillaries.
This is the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received from the premises the nickname Maison en os.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, pieces of tiles and mosaic, façade recalling stairs and everywhere present curves, this is all that is typical of New Art of Antoni Gaudi.
The front façade of the house runs its dream lines, its beautiful colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
In a more detailed observation, we see geometry, rhythm and order thought precisely.
At night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of colour brightness is reinforced.
The rolling and torsion of the forms also appears within the same measure.
The wood in vain copies the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyelids and the lams.
The house Battlo, which stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number 43, was born to build a house in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on demolishing the old construction and construction of another new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and better market reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-dwelling house was not thought of by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on its project that the decorations for an apartment representative of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the façade are born.
Other artists and creators also worked for the façade.
The joint work on Casa Battlo's plans began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park, where there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises overnamed the hot house just after its completion due to its organic forms "the House in Os. "
Others, given the specific mechanism for opening windows, called it "the bathroom".
It is said that above the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the patron of Catalonia.
Other elements of the sculpture of the building contain hidden religious motives.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with air events and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems strange.
During the creation of Gaudi did not comply with the construction directives at that time and did not be allowed to interfere with them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained permission from the city to build, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after the completion the municipal council was terrified and asked for changes.
He did not like, for example, the members of the municipal council that the building pillars lean on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the city's appeal, Josep Battlo asked (and was satisfied) for permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third room and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which you can access to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and right lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi is also working on the modern concept of space linkage.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the halls and the high society can communicate comfortably or very limited private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has also received new façades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the inner court is decorated and with the light wells.
The two-colour game gives a maximum light in all the floors of the house.
It was just enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than the shadow that otherwise absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most beautiful apartment available to the public.
Owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued their visits because they found it to be a profitable business and extended the scope of the visits to the common spaces and to the granier including the roof terraces.
The ticket to the monument is really not cheap and costs EUR 16.50; students, pensioners, groups and card holders have 20 percent discounts.
The amount is however above the entry price in Gaudi's other constructions in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic tours, you must quickly find a friend among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a blanket: women have other criteria than men.
Not an ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the area reserved for the bed, so the mattress and the floor provide a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must complement harmoniously in order to please a specific user.
During the selection, several things are decisive: weight, size, age, health status and the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress is to be placed and the floor is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where latex mattresses are not constantly falling asleep, they are not suitable because they are "heating" gently.
They have, above all, a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilating channels in the heart and if they remain on a solid board, they retain moisture. Of the harvest can also be formed.
The habit is also crucial in the choice.
The one who spends the time abroad where you often use very thick mattresses with a smoldering layer will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all the hockeyists who come back from NHL complain they can't sleep there."
"Because of their tired shoulders, their feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a smearing layer of hairy moustache."
"These mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder which therefore mistakes the "information" of joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in the refurbished furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattresses with the paresian mouse conquered the hockeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything goes well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to be able to appreciate a hairy mouse.
That "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing pushes on you and you won't come back at night like after a hard game.
You just sleep better.
The parsley also acts as a protection against squads.
For the selection of the mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and woman of a size of 180cm need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each bed in two places should be 90 cm or 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, singles are recommended to take at least 120 to 140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with the slightly folded thighs. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Matheliers and Decorators who has spent years on the problem of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaching it in specialized schools.
For a bed in two places each needs its own floor and mattresses, so pay attention, however, to choose the height of the mattress well.
Otherwise you will only be able to climb the floor at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
The soft mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the spring mattresses should be at least 15 cm, which counts for the shape and air layer at least three centimeters.
"To touch or sit on the mattress you must not feel the springs," says Hélèna Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-defined guy to sleep.
The bed-bed, when the mattresses and the bed are united as Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms to sleep.
The mattresses were very bad; we don't have to wash it, which is what's going on today.
And since during the night you normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to remember a large (and mouth) tamis.
For this reason, specialists refuse to make a 25-year life claim for a mattress or a life guarantee.
But it's all hers.
And for this, an experience board on the part of the sellers: for a 120/144cm mattress, give up, for the coating of the mattress, to the hygiene or to the washing, but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even though today it is common to make clothes with a shutter closure for the whole, that is to say that after opening you have two parts (for washing and washing machine size is very important!) otherwise the handling for large models (and for one person) becomes when you remove them a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a hard plank in your bed instead of a night?
Never!
Maximum for one guest bed for one night only.
However, equip the board (if no) with air holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with sachet springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an air layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For single-position blades with 14/18 blades, latex mattresses or sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and cocoa nuts), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more blades, 28 and above, where the blades are doubled in the bottom of the kidneys and so it is possible to regulate rigidity.
For multi-position mattresses, it is not necessary to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to position changes.
Alongside the rigidity of the blades, what is called a shoulder bracelet can also be installed.
It is a special bond of the blades that allows pressure to either insert the blade so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integres" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back", this is really an important thing.
This is already considered by the masculine manufacturers who for the "males" have started to use a shrinking area at the shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips level.
For the most difficult customer there are somiums with wings or platelets with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure decreases in more points and lowers the tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad earring (large and inflated air) on good mattresses and evenings, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple earring: the ear must support the head and its points only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that the Scandinavias by example prefer.
When lying on the side, the ear should be raised (with the shoulder strap of the evening or the shoulder area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first grass and straw.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also in the bio mats.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is produced, are replaced by natural oils such as soya oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use just the soybean.
"The bio qualification for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for carpet coatings; one of the first was the aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop fragrances in the forest or in the laundry.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of bubble plants for the coating of the mattress absorbs the heat and cools the body, "frozen" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore hotter for low sex.
Current favorites?
The mattresses made from cold mousse (it has more pores with a disrupted cellular structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold flies gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, the bottom of the back and the feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached its first place.
Saving for mattresses is not easy.
There may be a time-frame for special actions on the part of manufacturers or producers of two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex company that offers Duofreez mattresses with a memory mouse worn on the cover for 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second free.
The age of parous or viscoelastic mice with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the Tempur material at a "cosmic pace".
This started as a matter for NASA because astronauts were subject to the start of huge load factors.
The Tempur shrinks to the heat and hardens, on the contrary, to the cold.
It therefore perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is ideal for this against bad sleep and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic muscles are used not only for mattresses but also for products for health, such as special cushions for feet that relieve legs and the neighbouring system.
The Czech manufacturers use, for example, the EucathermC or Twinsaver fly or the same type.
The devices to follow people are increasingly being asked by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear of their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can also be used to track the movement of people and help in some cases, such as that of Little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is now as large as a box of aluminum but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of Little Anicka has emanated a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their private lives.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not a spin-off but only another way to reduce the likelihood that there is another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I'm afraid there may be cases of abuse of such devices, such as putting them in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I haven't met such cases yet."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons, adds Pilin.
According to him, children should always know for what purpose "the box" is used and how to use it in case of emergency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, points out that if the child does not want to wear such a thing on him, he will get rid of it.
'And even smaller ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something when they don't want to be under control."
"The mobile phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already brought their parents to long-term expectations," Bockova says.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is highly controversial.
"If this is a prepared rapture, the author will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
"Now it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (criminals) will also search for them because the sale will be supported by a advertising campaign."
"In such cases, the criminals will always be in advance on the police," says the psychologist.
It recognizes the same as such devices can help during unprepared aggression by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, who offers tracking services both for cars and for people, claims that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of aggression.
"The device may be set in such a way as to be in regular mode after a specified period."
"In the case where the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
'The most expensive devices also have a tiltimeter that immediately signals the position of the person who has moved and is in a position lengthened without moving,' says Cech.
According to him, the mobile phones are intelligent, which are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special proological.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to one that is carried depending on the size of a box or on the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that any attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he'll realize after a while, which will give the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to track cars.
This is a combination of GPS positioning systems (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating wires that it could make the tour of the Czech Republic with, but it can only hold two years.
The army bought 445 km of wires used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had bought it 224 km.
The army therefore has reservations for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of cordials is two to four years' maximum.
The army bought detonating bonds to the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The general state has given as a reason for a huge amount of detonating wires to MF DNAs that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations made by military pyrotechnics, which MF DNAS has contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with a command, secretary or household personnel should have an explosive exercise every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating wires.
At this distance there are 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the army's reserves could be subpoenaed for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, more than 2 m of detonating wires, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has secured, with the consumption of special units and engineering, reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the rapid intervention brigade soldiers recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no ammunition for their poking weapons and that shooting sessions were limited due to money needs.
We don't talk about the lack of body linen.
"And I don't mind if they buy us so much detonating string."
"And that's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good client that we as traders strive to content," says STV Group Jan Decky's business director.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of miles of detonating wires will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group states, however, that only four years of life of detonating wires and the pyrotechnics of the police and the army are only two years old.
"If they are perfectly stored in the warehouses, it may even go up to four years," says a two who do not want his name to be published in the light of the military's criticism.
The length of life has passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains integrated and does not threaten the soldier's life.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the department is a reduction due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating wires.
"They cost us 60 per cent less than the last year's supply of 245 km," says the spokesperson Pejsek, who interprets the opinion of the defence department's buyers.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating bands of police pyrotechnics that neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police always order only the amount of ammunition required to be used before the end of their life.
This has been developed for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and to be able to obtain more flexiblely the more modern and reliable types of detonating cables.
the Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the neutralization of dozens of tons of ammunition coming from the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovakian army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, head of the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNAS has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating wires that it buys today "in the good market".
So far, I am making use of contacts that I have obtained through the competitions.
The free sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the best individual entrepreneur's competition.
The winner of the best individual entrepreneur's competition for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards success is like in a movie.
Lucas Pytlou likes to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberia there was a lack of quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned when he was working abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a small building from 5 apartments in half a mile away.
Knowing that he was still studying in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of a accommodation in our region has given me a desire to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first apartment rebuilt for foreign workers.
He reinvests the benefit in the building that he converts into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his employer's action has enabled him to open 4 guesthouses, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
This year he became another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidacy candidates from Pytloun hotels," number 1 of entrepreneurs of last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory at the competition of the contractor of the year served well, add Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory has brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberia and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says that he still uses his contacts and knowledge that he could not otherwise obtain.
"With those I met thanks to the competition, I began to entertain trade relations regularly.
According to him, the reputation for success has also had an impact on employees.
And it's about 70.
"I observe in them the loyalty and pride of being committed to something that has been generally recognized."
"This is not, and far away, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name has been moved forward," says Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The victory's euphoria was rapidly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the Farmet winner has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to find the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury has rewarded the efforts with which it has transformed a tool workshop in Ceska Skalice into a business firm of 100 million crowns.
'I can say that the reward has not only encouraged me and my colleagues and increased our confidence in itself to fight competition,' the winner of last year's competition said today.
At the beginning of the story of Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of the goods by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career in a company where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few friends around his father for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they began specializing in the plant oil press.
He became the largest automatic press manufacturer in Central Europe after eighteen years.
The company was even known in the non-specialized audience after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only have our customers started to know the Farmet brand really better, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were working with a company that has achieved the greatest success in its country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But last year it didn't happen to Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The evaluation of the company was based on the economic results of 2008 and in part 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
In addition to the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were obliged to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We obviously didn't escape from this situation."
"Business figures have dropped by 40 percent, and we have to limit our production and even firearms," says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that it is time to take unpopular measures.
But they managed the situation correctly and maintained the benefits even if they were less than they had before the crisis.
In Farmet, however, they continued without commitment to investing in research and development.
"We have built a training and research centre with the resources, strengthened the presentation of the company in international exhibition halls and won the main rewards in national exhibitions," Zdarsky said.
We all think the crisis is behind them.
Business figures also increase the number of employees with them.
"A new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that deletes the insanity regulations.
The year's absurdity survey is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could have been deleted.
The little glamorous winner of this year's survey on the Absurdity of the Year was the obligation to provide documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 votes cast.
For example, social affairs administrations demanded a paper extract from the trade register while the official can obtain it in two mouse clicks.
it changes through the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the withdrawal of the trade register for insurance payments checks," said Jana Buranova, spokesperson of the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fill in the Czech Republic and to remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this year's absurdity competition.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even more popularity.
If 3,000 votes have been cast last year, at least 4,000 votes have been cast this year.
And it is not surprising that in our country there are the most diverse legal obligations that only stop the company, and, more and more.
"We may be in the number of documents to be completed for tax returns in the first place in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of enterprise activity has become a declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in 74th place with regard to the conditions for the company, 8 more than last year.
The year's absurdity competition was first launched in 2006 and continues every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone who can state the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities of April each year at the end of September, the last time before the end of the competition.
To report on the website www.firmoroku.cz. Then the competition organizer selects seven candidates for "antiprix" and allows the public to vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that has received the largest number of votes is declared a winner.
Until the last survey last year, it is one hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
The notes are sent by entrepreneurs but also professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition is the obligation, for example, of the nominees to pay the wages, or of the entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always begins at the beginning of November on Place Venceslas in Prague, is part of a regularly taking part in political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the closing of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts ethos in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this reason my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs which today only complicate the company," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to eliminate absurd orders is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days before the office for the individual company to the place where the company is located, the intention of going to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was deleted with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most widely discussed obligation in 2007, which was to declare at the Labour Office a service trip for a foreign employee for 30 days, was deleted with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything is okay until the third session of the competition.
The absurdity of 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This has been changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year - the obligation to have a refrigerator has been deleted.
A new category rewards those who are socially responsible.
Environmental, humanitarian, training or sports projects are evaluated.
This year's novelty of Hospodarske Noviny's competition, which has been in existence for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support the company's reasonable and just.
"We want to support companies that monitor the environmental impacts of their business and carry out a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vudaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the year's rebel competition.
For this first year of this subcategory of the 2010 firm competition, organized by Vodaphone, companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term objective for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to be published.
Although the purpose of their business is different from that of each other, their support and predictive activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this applies to persons with disabilities and to the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the entire Czech Republic there is no example of the Prague and Netera proological society that supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports disciplines.
Another example of firm responsibility for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the fund for the 17 years that sponsors children with disabilities.
In the case of employees with health problems, the old Podebrad paper factory, which employs more than 70 per cent of the paper industry, has obtained the title of the company Responsible for the Central Bohème region and has been placed in the region third at the Vodaphone-organized firm's competition.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who has earned to have introduced reduced working hours and even reduced to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionally, reduced wages.
The jury also gave him the title because he was buying the Czech manufacturers in priority, supporting a ditoyan activity in the vicinity and concerned about the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and our administration have the least environmental impact," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of society.
the company responsible IT Log in to the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has put in place an ergonomic chair and keyboard for each laptop, encourages their work at home and uses catering services from a local protected plant for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadow that helps the local Roma community," said Andrej Suchy, the representative of society.
The latter is also located for its activities, a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
"In our company we contribute to food, transport, skills and recreation," said Joseph Strapac of the company building bruntal Czasch, winner of the Moravia-Silesia region.
They were automatically registered in the responsible company category, all the regional finalists for the Vodaphone Company competition, who had responded to the questionnaires attached to the registration document and had referred it to the organizer before 15 August.
The incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the companies in high school had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified from the "principal" competition of the Vudaphone Year Firm."
"The independent registrations are not possible because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the Company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison&Rose organization agency.
In the Land Fund in Plzen, police arrested during a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have been arrested these last days.
The detectives passed the mints to the local contractor and traded by real estate Lubos. G.
He had endeavoured to manipulate just one call for public tenders for the settlement of an application for reimbursement in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a certain candidate.
That guy was supposed to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for a crime of initiation in the context of a call for tenders and a public competition," said Pravo, the chief of the Plzen Parquet Antonie Zelena, who knows that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is under way.
Police officers sent this 46-year-old entrepreneur away after 24 hours.
In order to know how he could influence a public competition, we can only speculate about so little official information.
On a Pravdo question, the spokesperson for the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund indicated that police officers had actually been arrested in Plzen in a separate place of work and that during the public competition.
"It was a client and in no case an employee, it was specified.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call for rights to transfer land under the Land Act" and is set up when several eligible candidates appear.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to resuscitation that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"In accordance with the proposed rights, a class of buyers is established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest rights," the Fund spokesperson explained.
Lubos G. had, of course, the information concerning the persons who were registered in the appeal and, as it is himself, a person who benefits because having purchased a large number of refund rights, he had proposed not to participate in the competition to the candidates on the ground.
And he was no doubt falling back.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his impalement.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the FdT standards.
It was in the case of the ex-Chief of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for editing land for which the decision to establish a construction had already been issued.
Lubos G. had just obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and where access to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the mayor for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The mayor was obliged to accept because otherwise she could put the construction at risk by a blockage of the land.
Households will pay an extra one hundred crowns monthly for housing.
Households will have to pay an extra from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
So the families will have to draw from their wallet from January to a hundred crowns a month more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, the gas of almost 2 percent more expensive, in some places you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will be also cheaper.
The increase in electricity should be expected for apartments with 100 crowns per year more than currently.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices due to significant development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
The gas increases moderately but of course when people need it most to warm up and therefore have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
These are mainly the largest commons that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 crowns per month, the Liberian families will pay more than 1000 crowns per year.
For the inhabitants of Prague, an increase of 9 per cent is prepared for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the price, an additional 6.8 per cent will be paid.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest compared to the whole country.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will, for example, increase significantly in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January, that is to say at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which has almost 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase to 100 percent.
Those who disagree with the new increase in rents will be translated into courts by society.
Regular rents paid by people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase the next year by 10%.
The Czech children are soaking in the rum and fernet. The beer is no longer fashionable and acts quite gently.
Fernet, rhum, vodka and in an exceptional way the best brand of whiskey are also stolen to parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who are healthy, who are not yet 15 years old, between the hands of the doctor.
Children who are hospitalized for relapse do not make the exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases in the admissions of the child hospitals departments.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be healthy."
'The trend is really strong,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Hospital of Horovice in Central Bohême.
"When they manage to chip a papa bottle in the closet, it's sometimes whiskey, but it's the fernet and vodka that prevails."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not feel it," explains the Head of Department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for the Motol hospital, also gives her reason.
"In general, it's rhum or fernet."
"It's alcohol in fashion today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slavovic that they returned from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the Chief of Department of Pelikan, seeing children from thirteen to fourteen years of age at hospital admission is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol, where he spent ten years just in pediatric care, where ambulances were bringing students from the wide area of Ivre.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
"She began her 12-year career when she was taken with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with an increasing mix with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Park of Holocaust Exhibitions at a party."
"What's interesting is that it doesn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter is missing 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is just the disinterest of parents or their tolerance outside the community that their rejections go to drinking, which is the main cause of the development of child alcoholism.
According to experts, however, there is no mention of child dependence in its strict sense.
"There is a chronic dependence on alcohol over several years with all the phenomena resulting from it, but it is not found in children."
"With those who use repetitious alcohol, it is rather a significantly disadvantaged socio-family background," explained the Chief of the Pélikan Department.
According to the spokesman Jurinova, about forty children of Ivre were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
They are included in statistics only in cases with severe poisoning requiring hospitalization.
The children of Ivre who are after the emergency care returned to them by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, Pélikan insists on three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of the sorceries, the holy Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"They drink after bad results or rather they celebrate the beginning of holidays."
"Of course I lived on the day of the nuns a admission of 7 Ivre children at one time," Pélikan said.
The child who spent the night at the hospital in detoxification under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who came home and suffered the next day of the "woodwall".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by glucose infusion and nutrients needed by the body.
"They're better lotus because they spend an excellent evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only surprised at the place where they are," adds Pélikan, adding that from time to time this wastes the good mood of the patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Transport by ambulance and hospitalization on intensive care bed can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I have applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their zeal cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to pay back one evening," Pélikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regression management, which should recover from parents the care-related burdens, do not treat the cases of children living in hives.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 of the five aircraft in total, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged aircraft from Casa C-295M, took off on Tuesday for Séville in Spain where the manufacturer of Casa-EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time that devices of this kind become someone else's property other than the Czech army.
However, they were abroad in the course of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are bilateral versions of the L-159T1 that have so far been in service in the Czech army and have been in flight.
The remaining devices are L-159 single-place versions.
They are stationed for the moment at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defence Press Department, the physical departure of Vodochody planes is currently unknown.
'The L-159 single-locations planned for the exchange were taken on long-term storage aircraft without additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The L-159 T1 Biplaces have been exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He stated that the army would not be left without seat, as the department signed an agreement with Aero Vodocoy in May 2009 with 200 million crowns for the transformation of four L-159 single seats that were not used in two seats.
The army took delivery of the first apparatus in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it has undertaken to introduce aircraft into the equipment of some of the Alliance's countries.
"The contract clearly states that the person taking into account the L-159 aircraft is EADS and that they will be used for training pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account how to achieve it," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army was not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for one aircraft Casa and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was introduced last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Department of Defence did not launch calls and contacted EADS directly.
the defence management argued that the exchange ensures future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army has bought 72 devices in Aero Vodochody and uses only 24, which wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft is likely to have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission complained against the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected as part of a European call for tenders and in no case by directly contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the latter should arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the yearbook is a low risk of cancer
Men who have the longer index than the yearbook are exposed to a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British journal Cancer.
This may depend on the level of hormone male testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger is a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men 60 years ago," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine which men should submit to the prostate cancer test, including by combining with the genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the 1994-2009 period, she followed with her colleagues in Great Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the yearbook.
For them as for 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the longer index than the risk yearbook, however, 33 per cent fell, for men before 60 years the risk reduction reached 87 per cent.
The length of the two fingers - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, among other things, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is just testosterone that helps develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a well-known Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer is "fully demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the motorways D1 and D5 are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow this morning.
On the roads and sidewalks, most of the time of the compact snow, the sailors worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th km towards Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and cars and the D1 auroute in Brno towards Prague.
The driver of the Central Car Club (UAMK) told the information
A truck was hit at 91 km, the 93th two heavy weights were hit, the accident was injured.
Several cars have also been found in the hole.
The problems are also on motorway D1 to 185 kilometres in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at 190 km or go to Brno and then enter the 182 km to Kyvalka.
A number of cars from several kilometres have been formed in this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident, and that's just when we arrived in Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several centimeters of thickness, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car rows are created in Prosek for example, Sterboholska Street is also closed.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The tramways take from time to time, for example, on the line between Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and Place de la Peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the major state of the Prague crisis still needs to meet.
Railways and airport also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 fast connections due to snow.
The lines from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. at night until 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rolling but by rerouting surveillance.
On the Vyskov road, three side roads are impracticable, on the Brno road it begins to have snowflakes in it and on the Blanco road the chains are required to pass certain communication routes to the higher places.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected areas.
So far, the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, it may be necessary to send snowflakes and snowflakes.
We can't estimate for the moment when they'll be rolling.
On the road of Hodonin, caution is strict in the White Carpathians region.
On the roads that are, given the protection of nature, maintained only by the aspiration of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warned CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two and ten centimeters of snow; it fell most in Bohema of the north, with often up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravia-Silésia region, it fell to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snowflake was gradually shooting in the Czech Republic.
Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army has sent to Afghanistan a new "intelligent" weapon known only under code XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and will "change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise canon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special munitions of 25 mm caliber developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive explosive, actually works as small grenades.
The munitions can be programmed in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target, but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind a barrier, a wall or a pit.
It is no longer protected from above and when it falls over a deadly rain of steel cracks, it can also put it out of control.
According to Richard Audiette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use the "smart" technology.
"The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtaining a specific point of view, according to which he corrects his target site and supports the rest.
"Let's say you've targeted 543 meters."
"When you press the rest, the weapon is loaded and pulled at the distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 localized jobs
The Fujitsu group locates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
The next year in July, 400 employees will transfer their place of work to Astro Park, which is currently located at Place Marienbader's office building in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday by the specialist in computer manufacturing and maintenance, the next year in July, 400 men and women's place of work, located so far in the Marienbader square of Bad Homburg city, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge complex of offices located on Lyoner Straße Street Street of Frankfurt Quarter.
A spokesman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group should group 100 other jobs that are still fragmented so far in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive. Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the working mode of the employees.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just renting.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a major location for us with remarkable infrastructure."
He argues that connection to the airport is just of great importance to a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new movement of an important business within the region caused yesterday the joy of the winners and the disappointment of the losers.
The Head of Economic Affairs of the Municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith concerning the place of implantation".
Fujitsu agrees with the city and its implementation is an important milestone for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," said Mr Korwisi.
However, friendly relationships could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer against the owner of the Place Marienbader building.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now to be avoided that such an exceptional place remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and builder of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the "vertical little" neighbor, as well as the other buildings of Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
Fruit of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the City Hotel. This led to many criticisms, not only because of the impressive construction of the surfaces that once served as part of the parking lot, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the company of rating and investment advice, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer of the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Group of Immobilien-Chancen acquired the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were sold back to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group, which is located in Tokyo, is considered the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch established in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu has probably much more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to install in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other branches present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name reminds of its star-shaped plan, includes the seat of the Confederation of the Electronic and Electronic Industry.
Server expulsion by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider expelled its servers from the site specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may be hidden from political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, is apparently staying in England.
In the United States, Wikileaks is attacked with ever more force.
The cyber-activists group "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and now seeks a host in Europe.
During this time, the prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called the other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is sought by Interpol, is likely to stay in Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excludes the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom", cyber-activists reported on Wednesday (local time) the origin of the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Earlier, the cyber-enterprise, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks' documents from its servers.
After the release of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists have used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to access the largest number of documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem in Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN television channel, quoting Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon had banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation conducted by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The president of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott at its meeting, reported the British newspaper "The Guardian".
"I wish that Amazon would take this action earlier in view of the previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on the other countries to refuse to use the servers on the platform.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, monstrous and unscrupulous, and in doing so, it endangers our national security and threatens our lives throughout the world," according to an independent senator's statement.
"No company is aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks spread the contents of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is listed on the list of persons sought by Interpol.
According to the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently qualified plots orchestrated by its detractors to pursue his encounter with Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesperson, Kristinn Hrafsson, told London that threats had been made against the site.
"Calls were even launched for Julian Assange's murder."
That is why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks keeps hiding.
Hraffsson was clearly responding to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the responsible for the revelations made by Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the Head of Government adviser, Mr. Stephan Harper, said on TV, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should be "killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone".
During this time, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for the US President, Barack Obama, described as "religious and absurd" the fact that Mr. Assange had demanded the resignation of the Secretary of State of Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently announced that he would engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we should be concerned about the opinion of an individual who owns a website," said Mr Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the claims of a website."
The U.S. government now fully passes to the test bank the protection of its databases.
According to a White House communiqué, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed to be responsible for combating leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for establishing "the necessary structural reforms" made essential after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects the information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and militants if they were ever threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said the spokesperson of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice dispensers are being prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day start-up course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted by visitors from all over the world.
In fact, where does all the ice come from?
Ice cream and ice machine.
Glacier, i.e. in German the ice buyer is a bit out of date, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaking.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the cooled glass with a spatula, has it in the glove and then starts to sell it.
For information, we do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice can't avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorbates founded the ice university in 2003 so that the ice creams coming out of its machines respond everywhere to the high Italian ideals.
The three-day start-up course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted by visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered and extended over several days. Practical sessions are also held in private glaciers.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk achieving their burning desire for smooth ice.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries across all continents from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of artistic education from California is proud of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a European quality product in the country of industrial ice in the future.
Anke de Berlin is a business manager and, after a few years, she wants to take out some special things from this work that's going on for the nerves.
Two Egyptian youths dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian household woman came because her children worship Italian ice cream.
The master of the glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
It is vital not only to good taste, but also to good health and consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cerise on the castle of the national superstructure and, in general, the south: "Italian ice is just the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in the manufacture seems quite simple.
Luciano uses basic ingredients such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender that heats up to 85 degrees with an electronic program, then cools immediately to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: it comes out of a pasteurised white base cream, based on all kinds of ice creams in milk.
The trainer is immediately asking: Is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without stabiliser?
How can you give free courses to the personal pleasure of the experiment?
Mr. Luciano warned against letting himself be misled by the spirit of time.
He who speaks only of ice cream "made from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers in spite of this: most often a natural product, e.g. from the guar grain flour obtained from the guar hareicot.
Of course, it is possible to manufacture ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will croque nothing but ice pellets.
Some changes in the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
The master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients obtained in the fruit or confectionery of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"providers will all try to refill you with dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
It is in sorbate recipes to fruit with sugar and fresh fruit.
It is in ice cream made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and, when added from cocoa powder, constitutes the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course need to switch to the use of ice-cream machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to manufacture four kinds of ice: vanilla, chocolate, moka and noose with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more pure fruit: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Noose ice does not necessarily contain the taste of noise, when it consists mostly of noises.
Kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture is the right taste of a ice," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is a calculation exercise: if you use the fish purée with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar should be reduced in the basic recipe.
A supplement of sugar is required for citron ice.
Luciano has a device with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (vines are used to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as before.
It's not just the automatic machine manufacturing of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the ice mix is simultaneously used to make it intact and returned to negative temperatures.
In spite of all the automations, small trays are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo barbows with pure fruit on his feet and, thus, slams his study friends when the control of the colosal blender ball escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "a similar incident may occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experiences the cultivation of genetically modified plants has undermined the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now formulated by the Testbiotech Expert Group, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well-informed," said Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, Munich on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the president of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other EFSA experts are under contract with the Ilsi Press Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has worked very hard to develop the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements developed are textually consistent with the positioning of the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the trade mark which would, in substance, be controlled by the authorities established in Parme in Italy.
It's already the second time Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking manager of the Efsa recently joined the Swiss Agri-Food Group Syngenta without a condition or a transitional period. In doing so, she changed camp.
There was little time, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's authority responsible for control and industrial lobbying, which raised suspicions of both the German Federal Agency for the Environment and European Members.
However, the Efsa does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, are exploited as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working for the Efsa account are not prohibited from contacting this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admitted that he worked for the International Institute of Life Sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
It is considered as a neutral forum bringing together experts who, among other things, belong to science, industry and politics to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree that genetically modified plants are accepted without any food testing in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, are the effects of genetically modified maize caused by the field," said Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?" Mr. Then asks about a defendant.
This is also Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been doing research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as well as in the United States and now in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are still hardly any researchers who are not related to companies.
In the opinion of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck said that "the industry controls security research".
The Stone Trace
Uli Gsell looked for it, at a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart's station with her tube on her back.
There was a manif.
He denied it.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and had begun to demolish a large part of the north wing.
Stuttgart's world was no longer the same: several thousand people have protested against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central station into a underground station that would cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the conclusion of the construction work.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (Cailsheim limestone) was built from 1914 to 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor who lives in Ostfieldern.
A few fragments were searched.
"These stones are remains."
"They don't have to disappear."
He declares with enthusiasm: "a modest and good market rock, simple and terrestrial."
He said that by cutting her off at school, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he's gonna do about this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
the traces of Stuttgart's stones lead to a former munitions deposit of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man makes the trade of old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolishment that happened in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were upset or if they disappeared in the discharge," he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He relates that he was subjected to insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had purchased the rest of the north wing to the demolishment company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything to resist the demolishment.
And if it does, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently carried out one of the parallel stone pipelines weighing an average of 80 kilograms whose value is between 6,50 and 14 euros.
Some keep it as a memory in all while also hoping to be able to do so during reconstruction.
Rongen had got 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still stuck in the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscapers, Particuliers.
They came from all over and took everything that could enter the chest and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or a limitation of grass-bands.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"it was this political component."
He enters his car all over the country, making the tour of his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He did some law studies that he left, and later he started studying biology before he eventually became a career in computer science.
And a stone lover.
The stock of 40000 tonnes.
He loves to treasure all over Germany.
He claims to be the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's getting cold.
Art carved sand stones are placed on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the bridge of Marienbrücke in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He's taking the road that goes through the forest.
It shows a bag of fingers: Pierre de sande red, previously part of the Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Yellow the travertine."
The parallel pipe was also part of Stuttgart Neckarstadion's Neckarstad.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the crossroads of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the red granite from the Holy Blasien Cathedral, the tuft from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What a work, what a effort, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that as soon as the stones were carved by hand and moved with simple palates and carts drawn by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were set up."
He did not become rich, even less demanding.
But this career now employs 14 people. In addition, stone cutters, sculptor, forgeron, glass blower and gardener have settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's gratifying," says the waste recycling.
Next time, he has to go to Cologne.
There's stones to be saved down there, too.
Fighting talent to win the highest potential
The counter knows a living flow.
16 students go shopping for small bread in the salmon, tomato sauce and white mangoes.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited the design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
As part of a kind of competition of ideas, they need to talk about the future car business with VW designers, and, passing through, know the Volkswagen firm.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in the competition to destroy better brains and engage, like Volkswagen, in multiform cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruiting the most dubious diplomats as far as possible in the amphitheaters before they reach the employment market and are not courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements on the performance of their students, we are trying to identify exceptional talents in practical projects and to trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the technical university of Brauschweig, the automotive group mastered the talents.
A young lady in the staff service shares the styles, bonuses and cards that include the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of vocational training and student work for young talent; she shows them the paths to access the group's seat.
It is Nico Selle from the technical university of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both sides: "Students come in contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can get to know the students, look more closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who go online as a collaborator."
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive we're trying to attract students.
"At the same time, the emphasis was placed on the professional project," said Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much more acute.
Businesses can no longer recruit their employees in the sector by making a three on a jury of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and, above all, courtesy of highly qualified work.
These are mainly the graduates from the engineering lines who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German VDI engineers, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI estimates, the gap in engineering positions will increase again.
Roman Dykta goes hunting for talents for KPMG account, audit firm, accounting expertise and advice.
It organizes costly events for talent recruitment, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a type of paper rally where competitors need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel in this way to the United States.
Participants can access KPMG branches and get to know the company.
The participant shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to look for higher potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to get out of the lot through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little of a thing"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"To this day, we have remained in touch with all the people who took part last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon," he says.
In addition to the direct adjustment carried out in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises perform in a classic way by participating in professional forums where they are hunting for the brain.
"We're trying to reach the graduates by participating in the professional salons."
"For example, in the solar technology room," says Ms. Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company is located in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the problem related to the issue.
Currently, 35 posts are being held on the company's website.
"At this point, it is very difficult to have vacancies."
"That's expensive and takes a lot of time," you know?
Another way to establish contact is to go through university teachers.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, such as the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to conduct professional courses or write his final study project at our home."
Honorable advertising campaigns are announced by solar specialists.
This is why the company is trying to make its advertising by exercising other qualities: personalized environment, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Sometimes, a large group can't do that," says Ms. Stübe, head of staff.
For a long time, money has no longer played a major role in job research.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Institute Great Place to Work, Solarworld occupies 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honour of German employers.
To this end, he asked the employees about their degree of satisfaction in relation to their work and their context, while looking at the conditions of the employees' framework.
The head of staff, Ms. Stübe, hopes that this placement will increase the image of society with employers.
"I think that candidates are particularly committed to external evaluations with respect to a potential employer," she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies who wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first of all taking internal action.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own collaborators," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own actual capacity.
"the satisfied collaborators form the best messengers."
When we treat his employees well and they identify themselves with the company, they only advertise their employer to their friends and knowledge.
"It's like we were playing in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drillings
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, South-East United States, over the years to come.
The Washington Government has issued a ban An equivalent ban and thus definitively annulled its initial plans.
Even beyond the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains for the moment prohibited.
The Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform, which is at the root of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with the cost of life for eleven employees and leading to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, who was under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, indicated that he was willing to authorize new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The parties to this solution thus want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating black tide in the Gulf is not, so far, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is faced with several billion claims for compensation, is at the centre of the charges.
A committee of inquiry established by Obama must present its findings on December.
In October, the Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the ice of the drilling decreed after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted requests for new drilling projects.
With more stringent controls and more stringent safety signals, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has distinguished itself from many corruption charges, is currently subject to profound reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that he would remove the lucrative tax niches from gas and oil groups.
The players in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the supply flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than is the case so far.
"The Government's objective is to put a stop to rapid growth in the gas and oil sector" according to the results of a current survey carried out in the sector by the audit firm BDO before the ban on drilling issued on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to new order, to the detriment of growth.
The country of Ogoni is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is poured brown; it pours a smell similar to that in the fuel station: Because of a leak, billions of litres of crude oil destroyed the country of Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live by flight, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has good intentions.
"Don't get exhausted," the environmentalist militant launched to the journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil powder in front of the water lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man lying in the water hole up to the breast, as well as the fat train that surrounds him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the splash of water at the color of the rainbow.
We can't see that the ground floor is filled with brown crude oil naps.
On the shores of the Bodo-Jetti River, Esther Badom tells us that, as a jadis, she collected shrimps from all the seals here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely tari.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil had jailli of an oil pipeline that had exploded in the huge marequerage.
Fishermen living in the small neighboring town of Bodo now have to pick up for six hours to reach fishy waters: The country of Ogoni at the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the ravages leaps in the eyes when you travel through the mangrove seas through watercourses.
Instead of a clear water, the motorboat sinks a brown credding water. Whoever dips his hand in it removes any oil cover.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground like clay barrels. The isolated palm trees are sadly left hanging their palm trees.
We are looking in vain for the nests of birds, as we usually meet in wet areas: Once the off-board engine stops, a fantastic silence lies on this paradise of times that looks like a service station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is war against the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield inhabited for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. It was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to the country of Ogoni is prohibited to this company: While more than 2 million black barrels are daily pumped through more than 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometres of oil pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields in Ogoni country are unexploited, because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All the few hundred meters rise in the water of steel wood as strange sculptures: It is very affectionately referred to as "noël trees" the head of drilling holes.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are wounded by corrosion until the repair.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature breaks down from time to time in pieces, because a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres have been spent on the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that occurred in the sea during the accident of the super-oiler "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago outside Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who is responsible for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and syphonation of the oil pipelines is responsible for more than 90 per cent of pollution. Environmentalists for their part consider the explosions of the drilling heads and the drilling pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner appealed to the Shell Group to apply more stringent safety standards to Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the failure rate of conduct is "far higher than at the time".
Some forms come from mangroves to a place that, in view of the distance, looks like a abandoned workshop, full of vans and air-installed: they are completely naked and covered with vans up to the neck.
A sparkly fire under one of the many tunnels that are often connected to the pipes, often spread out without a reason on the site, must be reflected: a small clandestine refinery.
The oil is heated in the tunnel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
In the first time, the essence penetrates into a container by passing through tubes, then at the end of the conduction of kerosene drops fall and it is finally obtained from diesel.
This is how Michael and his four employees produce four 300 litre Diesel barrels daily: "This reports us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
The people of Delta take advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil producer country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price less expensive than the ridiculously low Euro 40 cents per litre of Diesel: because they bought their raw material free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" who destroy the oil pipeline network across the country of Ogoni. According to experts, the country thus loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally cleaned: The organized crime networks that also include high-ranking politicians and military members, cost the lion's share in tanks and the world market brand.
The Akpobari militant believes that the debate on whether environmental disaster should be attributed or not to subversive activities to the population or the lexist production method is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the life of fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no flight and illegal refineries."
But, in the meantime, Ogoni's relations with Shell were so deteriorating that it was no longer a matter of withdrawal from the group. "Perhaps the operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will become better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's a long time for you to get rid of it" announces the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be the subject of arrest, but at the very least they will be offered wine pots.
Even soldiers from the north of the country mainly intend to benefit as all Nigerians from the raw material.
"At any rate, this trick has made our country very low," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 is clearly facing a major security problem.
By examining an emergency landing device, the investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, Airbus passengers belonging to Quantas had apparently had a more chance: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian air safety authority found that the reactors of certain A380 devices had a serious safety problem, and it warned against a possible failure of construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It may cause fatigue and leaks at the level of the connection of the oil pipeline, it is indicated in a position published this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of reactors".
The reactors manufactured by Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 aircraft from the A380 series are concerned.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land urgently on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now initiated judicial proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take other legal measures against society.
The Director of Quantas, Mr. Alan Joyce, said that his company would claim damages for the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts have been decomposed and the bearing surface has been damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it's oil inflammation that's the origin of damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that other safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
Security recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the air carrier Quantas immobilized the entire fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa replaced the A380 reactor by precautionary measures.
The two-storey plane is the world's largest liner.
Snowfall across the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany is covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost all of the country.
Chaos rules on all roads, trains and planes.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany grelotter: By ice temperatures, almost the entire Republic is covered by snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
Traffic is very limited on several highways and on many roads.
On the A7 National in Flensburg, winter service staff have been working on a permanent basis, but they have not been able to come to an end of the snow that never ceased to accumulate.
In addition, rarcal violence swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects this to be done by ras-de-marées on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels of up to 1.2 m above normal.
The snowflakes on highways and on federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the Bad Time Alert Center Metomedia announced the level of violent alert was announced in the Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell, which the strong and cold winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars stayed there all night.
Even in the Saxe-Anhalt country, police authorities have announced serious road disturbances.
On highway A2, the snow and the wind caused a disruption of the movement and caused noise.
In Thurnge, snowfalls hit highways A4 and A9.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disturbances in rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thurige and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are the snow on the railways, the trees falling on the railways, the chains or the needles destroyed.
In Saxony, the interregional transport of Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Salfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to stop its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers of the train in blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The Snow Chutes have led to many cancellations of flights in the main airports in Germany.
According to a standard password and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesperson for Fraport indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers at the airport are no longer numerous, although only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday afternoon.
On the night of Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snowfalls on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was jumped to a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, so the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car hit a gleaming shoe in Ashchenburg.
However, meteorologists announce a good news: snow will be always soft and dusty, but it will turbulence in the case of light rariles.
But the wind is going to faint.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by violent and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to 15 degrees per place.
The Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin tours.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to newspaper reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could report up to EUR 500 million.
The Deutsche Bank just took the seat of the group: The twin tours located in the Business Quarter have been modernised; while waiting, the bankers had to return to their former place of service.
In the meantime, the financial group is clearly seeking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" quoted as a spokesman.
This password did not indicate the reasons for the proposed sale.
He said, "We verify whether it is more interesting to take care of the buildings ourselves or sell them, and to reinstate them later."
Thus, the largest financial institution in Germany has already given up its seat, shortly after.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twins for an amount of EUR 272 million from own funds holders, and they were then remunerated.
The transformations aimed at energy optimization amounted to approximately EUR 200 million, according to some indications.
Of course, sales reported a lot of money to the bank.
According to the information provided by the newspaper, experts in this business sector estimate the value of the tours, which were rebaptized between "Green Tours", to some 500 million Euros.
According to the password, it is currently not known whether the buildings will be resold to a fund belonging to the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the minors who have lost.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for minors who were reported dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The safety situation of the sinister well continued to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been born on the ground.
A probe had been introduced into the sinistered well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no relief teams were able to descend into the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and administration considered the minors no longer had any chance of survival.
Until then, the bodies couldn't be lifted up.
Today, parents and friends have organized a memorial party for the dead.
Thousands of people were gathered under a sun in Greymouth south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 minors ensemble, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
The photos and personal effects, including the clothes and surfboards, were also present.
Flags have been installed in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative party that New Zealand had given hope that the minors would rise to the surface.
"But they never returned home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was found in the woods, said that he could not refuse to accept the death of his son until he had seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' parents, several foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative party.
South African and British minors also celebrated the first explosion on 19 November.
The relief workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police chief Gary Knowles explained to reporters that when the mass of explosive gases is moved, the burning temperatures within the mine begin to decline.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splater movie an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the former kind through his film, "Wallala Rising", the age of the fighter.
To what public did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn well think of turning "Wallala Rising"?
A warrior Viking (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is made prisoner; he frees himself from his burreau and, with a nearly supernatural force, eliminates his opponents after each other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of a bloodthirsty act, just because our hero uses brutal methods of murder. When he is a bad mood, he pulls the guts of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the village doesn't say a word on its real name. Even the other characters escape, at the top of all, in the midst of one or two phrases some exuberant agony of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and celebrated in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the decoration of the Vikings' universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be more ideal for mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travel.
When a film is aimed at several target groups, it's a shame that they are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy concerning the drug dealer Farouche and full of style, as a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more humor to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the art and trial film.
Most art cinema sympathians have to experience the horror of the brain that spreads around and into the intestines.
Action film lovers are bored, when the village embarks, for reasons which one can freely interpret, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for eternity by the calm and the thunder before the crew arrives in America and continues to faint.
It is not surprising then that "Wallala Rising" did not find any film distributor in Germany and that it exists only in the DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of the misery that deserve some attention, but also because the image of a film beating, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
There are no dialogues in this film, no consistent action, everything is ambience, a festive dream transformed into a film.
The viewer can't get away with it.
Renn gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glamorous images and a lurid sound band, but especially with an unsatisfiable hate that delights in the heart of characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who is faithfully standing next to the village, preserves some innocence, all others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the bourgeois hero whose mobiles are never known, but who comes back from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies by turning himself into a warrior, may be sent from the devil himself.
He represents corruption, but perhaps also, nothing but for those who are, in any way, able.
"Wallala Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which for the sake of accompaniment, enthusiasm and surprise.
A traumatic experience.
Mysteries of the Landing
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications on a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this issue, even less subject to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007 at midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I hunting planes attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building in the Syrian territory.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the largest city in the vicinity is 30 kilometres: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is in the IAEA documents, as it is the question of the reactor that Syria has built appears with the help of North Korea in parallel pipeline of stone, dissembled in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a United States briefing of information services, the CIA, at the end of April 2008, would be well equipped to produce plutonium, the current reactor known as the locality El Kibar, which would produce nuclear weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video containing smooth satellite images.
Through computer-aided animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component before the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the nearby building, even inside the building.
It seems that the reactor was on the point of being put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, we have only more information than at the time, and even, over time, the mystery is growing.
The former President of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that prior to the attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor to el-Kibar, but there were few indications that this country was developing "a nuclear-weapon-active program".
Some information agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "presumptuous reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation as "flexible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Questioned about how it was ensured that it had dealt with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic answer in summer, claiming that IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians have certainly hurriedly removed the decompositions of the "unutilized military building" and proceeded to a methodical landing of the land.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team of experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of uranium produced by men in El Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received from a Member State images of commercial suppliers' satellites showing the moment that followed the attack directly. It appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous commander, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
That is why it is impossible for the IAEA to objectively establish their authenticity.
Syria has always ensured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damas argues that uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
However, the IAEA rejected this argument after the analysis of the particles by qualified as impermissible.
Since then, ladies have been refusing any discussion on this, as well as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow the controllers to conduct a second inspection on the El Kibar site and refuses access to the decompositions of the building destroyed by the bomb.
Yet, even Israel maintains an unbreakable silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister at the time of the attack, recently stated: "We will never comment on this."
This is how the investigation on this case has been taking place since June 2008 without a result and that it "becomes increasingly a serious credibility problem for the Agency", as a high-ranking Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna recognizes, finally, a serious violation of the Nuclear Weapons Prohibition Treaty.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other installations that must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, inspectors have not indicated which facilities are here, what their function is, or what they are suspected of being contained.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known in the IAEA under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah respectively as the names of the neighbouring cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute of Science and International Security) of Washington identified these sites and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would be very likely one of the suspects.
It may be located in a military base or directly next to it; that is exactly why Syria refuses to access the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrians maintain that the inspection team is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is information provided by US secret agents that draws the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the parallel stone pipe to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve fuel production".
There would be "no indication of sensitive activities", such as the enrichment and withdrawal of uranium; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor works certainly thanks to non-rich uranium.
However, there is strict plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental issues: where should uranium come from and where would later be separated the plutonium necessary for the manufacture of the bomb.
It is not known whether the engravings, which could hide valuable traces, were stored in the three sites.
When hundreds of land trucks have disappeared, no one will have any information on the place of storage of the grave.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had examined in 1998 the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it can agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
By recently analysing photos taken by satellite on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, the former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
However, photos taken by satellite show that Syria has undertaken landslide work in the three suspicious sites and moved out of huge containers when IAEA began demanding access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it did not help to avoid suspicions.
In the diplomatic environments, the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan on the inspections to be carried out, which was to enable Syria to maintain any military secrets. Only the time invested shows the great interest of the inspectors in this case.
During that time, Damas also put an end to this proposal.
One year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported in this case, for example, said Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has referred to what has been known under the name of the special inspections, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The Director of the IAEA, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but he is still reluctant.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and a large number of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation rise.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives thought to, "Would it be useful if at the end they found nothing?"
Love in Time of War
It's been bad ever since Angelina Jolie made her first summer as a realist.
She wrote the scenario herself: it is a story of love between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
There's nothing more to know about this story, but that's enough to cause the malaise.
A persistent rumor indicates that the Muslim woman fell in love with her Serbian bourreau during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested. In response, some of the rotations planned in Sarajevo were moved in the last minute to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film was filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, the protests continued in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women war victims sent an correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (HCR) and requested her to meet the actress. Jolie herself is an ambassador of the good will of UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat, but a few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to meet with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says quite a long time about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization has subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner to withdraw the quality of good-will embassy to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has received copies of its script, has given a tour authorisation to Sarajevo after some hesitations, but we do not know why it has not then come.
The young author himself assures that she does not pursue political goals with her film, that it is making a lot of effort that she has been aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She supports that she wants to exert the terrible consequences of the war and give all the parties involved the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circle on the Net. It's quite different: Lovers knew well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is still a big difference with the version "a victim of rape falls in love with his bull."
That Jolie's film started well before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, thus expressed Jolie, is "injustice and based on wrong information".
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can bring peace to him: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, as many others have done before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, everything is going well with the Irish again.
No trace of consternation.
That is why the local team is overdominating visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.

Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computerist, these two behaviors are really not going well together.
And yet, the 26-year-old man seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terrible question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will conduct employment interviews in New Zealand.
"I'm trying a strange feeling, however," he says.
"The country is so far away and I don't have a job."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she has decoupled her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Because of the country's dark perspectives, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their chance abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, and his brother Colin now serves as a computer consultant in London.
Young people go: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of the tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even provide for a number of 200,000 immigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are fulfilled, it will be a similar emigration current to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed a great ease, the sorrow now takes the whole place.
The economic crisis, however, affects, in particular, Irish young people, well-trained, who have so far known only moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's money in excess.
But in the meantime, three people under 30 years of age are unemployed.
The Irish Times magazine publishes a lot of readers' letters written by young immigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes to the derivation."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunity to do so goes away with our country as a whole."

However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to address this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" salon, which offers full support on the topic of "working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the stages of the professional hierarchy," he said.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing more to be done in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house just came out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional job so that he can complete the loan he has contracted to build his home in the country.
"The situation is already a little rough," he says by crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I don't practically live anymore."
He bursts out of a jammed laugh by passing through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-circuited front gardens, expensive cars with large brands are stationed on access routes.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister for an amount of 380,000 euros, financed 100 percent by credit.
"There were moments of madness, no doubt, the money was easy," he said.
Is he afraid to see everything go wrong because of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, wakes up from the hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to entertain and I'm young; even through everything, I can go to zero."
The building engineer does not like the complaints he often hears in recent times.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as what we have been living here on the island before," he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not what can happen worse, maybe it's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, simply."
This idea is pleasing to Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life goes elsewhere.
In his palm trees, he has already been working for a few years in London. That is why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries her well these last days: the party to be held on the occasion of her 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a goodbye party.
"Only, not much emotion," he said by drinking a long brewed beer.
"Adieu, it seems all the same worrying."
"Let's call it a good evening, all alone, bringing together some friends, with some drinks and some games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become more worrying than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it follows the change of attitude in the region.
Two related elements are the results of this year's survey, carried out in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a strong decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents to Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, reducing the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of the region's respondents were satisfied with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same as last year but with a strong increase of 25% in 2001 (Figure 3).
Some 34% said that they had confidence in their country's Parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in the two cases; but significantly increased compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America have wreaked support for democracy.
If this has been well maintained during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in the United States have suffered only a brief recession and have received a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin American people living in poverty increased slightly only in 2009 and decreased again this year to 32 per cent.)
But the humidity varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where recession has been more severe and where violent crimes have worsened.
This is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America in general have quoted crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say that they or one of their relatives have been victims of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is down compared to 38% last year and is lowest since 1995.
Stronger economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71% of the region's respondents say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); although their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, ex officioates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest manager in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered to be the country most influenced by respondents to Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A suffrage vote
No one expected to have a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country sign up and spit in fear.
Voting boxes and a new ballot were presented, ballot papers scattered in the gouts, suffocated polling stations and intimidations.
The polling stations would open late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced following the January earthquake, would be in the vicinity to find a place to vote.
Some of them ended up abandoning.
A dozen presidential candidates, including a number of alleged supporters, denounced the fraud and claimed the annulment of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, views the event as "a pretty good election in many respects".
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said discreetly that they did not "believe that these irregularities, as serious as they were, had necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are liable to René Préval, is a president who is out of town, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is required to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second expected tour is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial appeal for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no perceived support from the voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second tower reaching the second tower.
With a cholera epidemic that rages, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be possible.
On the occasion, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards needed to vote were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, clearly, the Haitians do it themselves.
The point of feet towards the center
The weeks after becoming suddenly widow, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved its approval rate of 20 points, at more than 50%; this is its higher level since it was elected in 2007.
However, to turn this into a successful campaign for a second term in election next year could depend on Ms. Fernández's choice, apparently in mourning, according to which she would abandon the intransigence of her deceased husband, predecessor and former political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of developing budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend their additional income on a voluntary basis.
Ms. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has dwindled in the development following Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement have joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where a parliamentarian struck one of his peers on the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress did not approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even greater scope for voluntary spending.
The economy is largely overheating: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade union wage claims see this figure as close as 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took up his post in 2003 when Argentina was afraid of economic collapse, gave priority to growth and poverty reduction rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and charged INDIC, the statistical office, which conducted falsifications of official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage increases to 18% next year.
The economy has been stimulated by high global prices for agricultural exports in Argentina.
Inflation, however, led to a sharp rise in growth due to a strong de-evaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government concluded an agreement with the debtors who had refused a previously forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be eating towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it is worth some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always stressed that this could not involve IMF monitoring, as it is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices, which is like a prelude to the sanitation of INDIC.
It is not clear if Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term of office, now that her husband is no longer there.
If she does, she needs to gain the support of the middle class, among which the clergy are very popular.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacations in Mars, the wave of sympathy for her will reflect.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to rebuff many of her husband's policies without noise.
A Half-Hourra for China
Taiwanese voters are heading towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother on the other side of the highway?
More than 7.5 million electors were present on 27 November, or 70 per cent of eligible persons, to elect mayors and municipal advisers in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeu.
Mr. Ma himself became a substitute for the feelings in relation to the continent, having created innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganisation of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. I did the test, but it's all right.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party won three out of five mayors, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which turned to Taiwan's full independence, won almost 50% of all the votes for KMT by 45%.
If it were a presidential vote, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote fell by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main subjects of Taiwanese elections, including campaign trucks and mass-collection flags with girls who had a minimum dance.
An attempt to commit a mysterious murder has also been made.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate at the time of the election.
A man from the crowd shot at young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, hurting him and killing a passerby.
Suddenly, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, said the killer had consequences on the election by leading the suspicion of the DPP and turning the voters to the KMT.
Perhaps China was the largest winner of the elections.
It was striking how far the issue of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its independence in fact and hates China's military threat.
Thus, KMT has a tendency to avoid discontinuing its relations with the government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from appreciating the anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his Chinese policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy to mourn Taiwan, from returning to the barracks.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but start with the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP was reinvented in any way.
Two years ago, he went badly: his former boss, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison for corruption charges.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a proponent for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has seen under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP work together to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was greeted as a candidate for the DPP in the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for an expert panel to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from its cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to challenge the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will have trouble choosing among its potential candidates.
KMT needs to do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite a vertigo economic growth, KMT's candidates did not want to campaign with him.
It seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesperson says that his cabinet and his local antennas will be replaced.
The good results of the PDP suggested that Taiwan's support for reconciliation should be limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return is already past."
Grammy Awards nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a selected surprise in the category "Best New Artist"
At the request of a president, people are required to know about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer who was handcuffed by President Obama at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the Grammy Awards' surprises this year with a large nomination in the category of "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a little mysterious but is consistent with the rules of Grammy Awards that an artist should not exit more than three albums before recording; this "sets the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 "Chamber Music Society", has certainly marked a step forward and, given its slightly engaging vocal style, his skilled hand of pop and funk and its Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a pointed line in Spalding with regard to Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent for the Grammy Awards voters, taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
In addition, the Grammy Awards voters have just honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "historicity" in the " instrumental album" category, which was turned on a re-registration Frisson that was one of the main favors last year.
Among these yesterday, "Moody 4B" of veteran saxophoneist James Moody and "Positootly" of keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition in particular.
The Trombone Shorty, which was popular with the loud voice of the New Orleans and was invited to the HBO's "Treme", has been honored in the contemporary jazz category; it is also strongly inclined to a certain fusion with the albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The secret Society of the Darky James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, has won some well-deserved awards in the large group category; in competition with the rich room-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose "Pathways" album of his octet's live was a great example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group leader.
Grammy Awards nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey run in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Annual Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers all over the world.
In the head of the nominations, we quote "Deus Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for the piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electrical orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California, there is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony n°4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in high school for a reward.
The classic appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year sets out five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are the Symphonies n°3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium - the art of Castrati" putting together various artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" of Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" of Kaija Saariaho of the German Symphony-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Chreur of the Theatre Marinesky; and "Ivanhoé" of Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers that are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include Pärt for Symphony n°4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machinea", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionattet Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No.4 was first at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of approximately 30 minutes is named "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the ex-magnet of Mikhail Khodorkovski oil, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was appointed for its solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said he had recently written the work of 15 minutes especially for the interpreter at the Avi Avi Vital Mandoline, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using the sounds of the Middle East and a lot of ranges and rhythms of North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The head of the orchestra Pierre Boulez, 85 years old, received an appointment in the category of orchestra benefits, for leading the Symphonic Orchestra of Chicago in a recording of the works of Stravinsky.
Among the instrumental soloists who have received an appointment are the pianoists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organizer Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalists-solists; here are Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Bruegergosman.
In the category of classical mixtures, soprano Jesse Norman received a nomination for his recording "Ragines: my life, my song"
The Temecula Mosque project is approved by the Planning Committee.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public witnessing, often passionate.
Critics took part in the project, claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the Commissioners decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention him," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, saying Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it as an American citizen."
"This shows that justice brings it."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, in the short term, also distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper website.
"There is no more America," wrote one speaker.
"It's another monkey planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, instead of the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 co-existing families in the Riverside county for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square feet mosque in Mediterranean style architecture would be composed of two mines and raised to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32 hectares site on the Nicolas road about two miles east of the Chaparral lycee.
Opponents may still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerating arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a foreign bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has opportunities beyond major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why she's very special, even though she's far from being a really "foreign" life form," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the University of Arizona State, co-author of the report in the online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria discovered in Lake Mono, California, are able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what's still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the University of Arizona State, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in life research beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could reveal the discovery of an alien life.
That wasn't the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a lucky discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrology, who conducted the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it has speculated that one microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace one another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organizations have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough so it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and somehow rubbers the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the known bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing arsenic concentrations to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can naturally occur, either on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, deputy professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that this could work.
Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, she said; thus, researchers suggested that the first forms of life could be used.
This suggests that there may be other ways to train life, not only the way life on Earth was trained at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
Research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two exposed dogs were found in Compton
The other two dogs on four flights outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of the county of Los Angeles announced it on Thursday.
The four dogs at the exhibition - two exigencies and two pembroke gallois corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they spent the night outside a motel 6 of Bellflower, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson of the sheriff's department of the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that dogs are going well," says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They have been returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, where the neighborhood and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
"We don't mean it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the orders."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be attached to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a shelter for the animals of the county located in Downey.
The sheriff's agents found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female, were healthy and free, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the choirs that Rickard and Peek planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were taken away until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the "AKC/Eukakuba" National Championship of Long Beach, where they were supposed to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other trials scheduled in the days preceding the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba", Peek said in the Times on Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops of the canine show tour for almost a month from the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and get their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a boxer boot, a parson Russell terrier and a Breton spider - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the basket, the thicker fur, in the truck where it would be cooler.
They have a little open windows so dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck flight at 6 o'clock on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corps, with a micropile implanted to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward has been granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to redecorate again, the restructuring of MGM expects no more than the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green light to start again at zero.
A federal judge of the New York bankruptcy officially rented the "pre-packaged" plan on Thursday by creditors that about $5 billion of debt would be eliminated; opening the way to the entertainment company, with 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television broadcasts.
With Thursday's decision, according to which the plan meets the requirements of the United States bankruptcy code, there is no legal obstacle to MGM to surrender under the supervision of the Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum entertainment founders, who will become the general directors of what will be an all-encompassed studio.
Staff will be brought back to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility, which is intended to finance new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself meets $75 million, and should be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the Investment Bank Moelis & Co. was engaged to advise the management on how to place its finances, since it did not have the means to pay interest of $300 million a year.
In August, the Director General, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an ex-PDG of Enron and an expert in recreation known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and meet the more than 140 studio creditors took much more time than planned.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, the sale to the auctions attracted few bidders, none of whom were ready to pay the sum of 2 billion more of whom the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be repeated when the MGM team had started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive millions of dollars' premiums for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already earned $1.2 million, will receive a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper companies, which have collected $375 000 a month for their business management services, will receive a 4 million-dollar success premium.
Barber and Birnbaum intend to re-launch the production of MGM, which was released only one film this year, and put in place an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM's debt, tried to make a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Tech toys to maintain your balance budget
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful game is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 strings to jump classic beads, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wolesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, the technological toy of this year is likely to have more force; yet, the same price is less than the same price, compared to the last year.
In addition, while there are usually fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most famous of these sites, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button stack games are increasing, as well as rechargeable stack games.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, except if otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are toys in pellet of the size of an Indian cocoon that sings a note when you press them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows a song to be composed.
If you buy more, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start supporting, you can no longer stop.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Inspiring Elmo Live's technology last year, the 14-inch animatronic dome plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can make the moon dance thanks to its innovative feet with wheel-blocking.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of quiz cards designed to turn a car balloon into a session with a self-correction and a van classer.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Leafster Explorer ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3-7 years) uses an iTunes type system to offer games and electronic books and has an entry for SD card that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a set of five blocks with a maximum of one box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, it is ideal for an impromptu orthograph competition.
In addition, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys shops, the two largest are Webkins and Penguin Club.
To buy your child an online pet from the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 years) which includes a marked piece of a hidden code.
When you buy the online code, your child receives enough credit from the Penguin Club store for two items to choose from.
It can be a wheelchair or a pet toy puffle.
slightly bigger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the last micro-bots with button stack.
The animal fake moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to do a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
She's also strong.
Ours has resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in our dog's throat.
Bring a softer side to maintain order in China
Tang Shenbin held a seat in the city as a urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nerves, issuing low-voice orders with a military authority.
He wanted female Chengguan members - who were in charge of the public order in China, afraid and despised for their arbitrary repression and their penance for violence - to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Keep on the right!"
"Be strong!"
Show them, he says, "What do beautiful girls look like?"
Four girls who had barely passed adolescence in white gloves, clothes and identical olive-colored pants, were looking at you.
Four pairs of black-and-tall shoes, aligned to the rule.
Four well-treated hats perfectly pierced at the top of hair attached by a reddish, blue and white knot.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with contempt.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher degree of study.
The province of Guangdong has replaced the grey-green uniforms with a more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced them with a strong eyebrows: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart with black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the co-porteur recaptures his affairs and parts.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen to perform a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the urban environment of 13 women, especially chosen for their appearance, age and age.
The idea is to give the degrossian police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have difficulty in drawing attention to this underground urban brigade of China.
And because of that, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media show the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei beat an observer to death after using his mobile phone to film them as they spread a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Pekin's inspectors, broken and online, describes how he effectively beats the offenders without issuing blood.
This year in Shanghai, a Pasteur was abandoned with a brain injury after a bakery with five officers.
A video game featuring violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to attack street vendors.
"Chenguan marked the government," said China Daily last year, a national publication, after a single controversy on tactics.
The newspaper called for "real complete cleaning."
The skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district went through an announcement in October to find eight new women's recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real jobs or whether they were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little bit of the two.
The district's announcement required female candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five face traits in the right order."
They must have a size higher than the average of 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
The 26-year retirement is mandatory.
Officers said that work was physically too painful for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, an almost governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they agree; this is about the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "inside qualities."
Chengguan's women are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not follow this description.
But he noted that the requirements for height were the standard standard in many Chinese employment offers for both sexes.
This is the case with regard to the order of the face.
What it means is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or disabilities are not required to post.
"We can't let a person who's boxing or a boss come here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols the place Baoguang near a monastery, is 22 years old and has pummeled games with a finely curved mouth.
She did not consider the development of her appearance as a sexist, she said.
"Do you think I have a sexy air in this uniform?" she asked for a dissipated air.
Xu Yang, his colleague at the 21-year-old fossils, said, "Our work is to present the image of the city."
They did not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they were feeding more career ambitions than simply chasing sellers in the streets where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces dozens of traveling merchants who move quickly by foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as little bread or tofu bags as possible before taking the escape.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you before!" said Mrs. Xu, as a salesman walked away, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-carrettage to the nugget.
Agents describe their functions rather as monotonous than hot.
"It's almost the same every day," said Huang Jing, 20-year-old, who is studying marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to alert the offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exposure of hostility to bureaucracy that is common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after spreading false rumors that Chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen policemen and Chengguan officials were injured, 14 government vehicles were turned upside down or fired.
Xindu has so far avoided such violence.
But calm is not quite guaranteed.
Just two pieces of houses in the placid place Baoguang, where female sex officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as the regulations impose it on them.
The owner of the motorcycle created the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the policemen, on the left side of the road, broke down a road to their vehicle and left at any speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, a 40-year-old coordinator attached to the male team, stayed behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female sex officers, coordinators - 40-year-olds or older - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain an image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Reads of a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts."
Prosecutors will not blame Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Department of Justice raised criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, resulting from a case related to an assistant of an old campaign and his efforts to obtain a lobbying job for the wife's husband, announced the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered a potential Republican candidate for the 2012 presidency until the scandal around his case did not make the big national titles last year and undermine his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" with the decision, as a result of a one-year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he had no intention of holding charges against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice abstained from commenting on this.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise for many lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, according to which there would have been significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have attempted to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 at the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying job to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the Senator's case with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as a treasurer during a Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they had committed Mr. Hampton to lobbying for them; according to documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for a year by the law to lobby his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to contradict the said ban on lobbying.
According to the evidence made public, "there seems to be a prima facie evidence of a plot to violate and substantially violate the law of the turning door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from an investigation by the government.
Although the Department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed to object to political prosecutions after a number of high-level appeals filed by its public integrity section, including the decisions last year to abandon prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct.
The federal prosecutors are clearly afraid of taking up arms, Melanie Sloan, the Director General of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of defences that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief lawyer of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call on Monday from a prosecutor of the Department of Justice and a follow-up the following day, saying that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed him in a communiqué on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to state the legal arguments he had made in the prosecution.
"I am not able to enter into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, claiming that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find the lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after receiving Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's cabinet chief, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he "martela" the Interior Ministry on an issue in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also participated in lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had engaged Mr. Hampton in lobbying.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned from his position as leader of the fourth republican class in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to hold a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator would hope that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call points to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were in the middle of the audience room.
They sent every minute of terrible witness reports on Twitter.
Finally, the defense said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the rape trial and children attached to their bed in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, the trial followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence to the court that goes beyond appeal arguments, which are likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is causing is that intense reports on the trial - as well as widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - have created a "circuit atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with fire details that the jury has been badly influenced by the public's passions.
The application could lead judges to debate the question of whether new technologies require new rules in the hearing rooms.
"I have experienced this during this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the hearing rooms is a violation of the rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr Hayes, lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Supreme Court of State, has therefore rejected the claims in the trial made last week, claiming that the media were "well controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been animated by the passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
The appeal courses have been acknowledging for decades that the media coverage of known cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 judgment that took place, the Supreme Court of the United States annulled the conviction of a Cleveland osteopathy, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere in the trial " due to the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "Le Fugitive".
Some lawyers have stated that the appeals courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be necessary to manage the means of communication of the hearing rooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford's Law School who studied the death penalty at Connecticut and wrote a report that she has been arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of the instantaneous communication from hearing rooms could allow for a fairer trial.
The case of Twitter is only one of many other descriptions of Mr. Hayes' lawyers, who can be discussed for years, which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered injury when the Blue Judge refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jury members by showing them macabre pictures of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jury said he was horrified by the victims' photos, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
The defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will support that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jury, who had been critical to the prosecutors, and that he has abused the pressure on a verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to resolve in a week-end.
The jury was not kidnapped.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a dispute against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates at the Governor's post and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media continued to attack the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily loophole of tweets from the media, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "was nothing like what was seen here in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the statement that the new instantaneouss were more fire-fighting than the communiqués released more slowly was a ludicrous view that would support the Court's policy governing the media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said that appeals were often drawn by the arguments that social and technological changes required an adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 that had reversed Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and they stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civilisation bring the cliffs closer?
After a campaign marked by invectiveness and negativity, a minimum of civilization broke out in Washington this week.
Is this an early sign of real bilateral cooperation in advance or an illustrative moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The meeting of Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not raise any awareness of the major issues that must be addressed during the session of the "box canard".
But of course, there was at least a polar discussion about the differences between the two parties and the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
The Commission's public meeting on Wednesday on the President's deficit was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect over the ideological gap; however, it still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to state that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a period of trial and mutual trial to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the electorate's patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the Tuesday meeting and the subsequent comments of the participants revealed a minimum of demands or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether tax, expenditure, health care or rights, both parties remain thousands of miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"He has no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now next to the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
Elections give rise to partisan passions and then they suffocate.
It's okay."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the session of the "boxed canard", Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve one or all of them permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment allowances, only because the Republicans cannot afford to give themselves the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits for the unemployed.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is planned on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "box canard", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that a successful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the Lame Duck session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, or inevitable.
"When things have to be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widespread skepticism that civilization would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow boxing compared to the 2012 main event, he said.
The reasons are closely linked to the composition of the new republican majority in the House and the voters present in the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to be aware of their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are now and are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, rejecting the retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington, and they themselves have imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes to the Commission, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had difficulty reaching that number.
The largest resistance remains among the group's electors, which suggests that there are at least a few reasons or a willingness to compromise on tax matters today.
Galston foresees two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first year will come in the form of partial confrontations, as the Republicans contest Obama on budget, tax and health care, and will then be followed by a period of greater bilateral cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proved that, despite the partial spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties working together.
If confrontation leads to impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will observe closely the public's response.
The person who will be judged to be lost will have to change his mind and find compromises.
However, this would be an optimistic view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there were then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the militants of the two parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consequent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilisation exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find a framework of understanding on the issues that still divide them.
American documents released describe Moscow as a source of corruption
The control of the city is between the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and leads to Kremlin some of the wine pot and the protection money it collects, the US Embassy in Russia reported in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service carry out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical power" - takes part while the money is heading up the scale.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been exported.
She was written while Yuri Loujkov was still the mayor of Moscow; and he is largely responsible for corruption.
He was released in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but since then there have been little cleaning traces.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied corruption charges over the years; and he has won several trials in defamation of these charges.
In September, he said what follows a Russian television channel, when he was questioned on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's throwing, it's anything."
The Russians believe, to a vast majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy account; and it is strange to think that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it "disfunctional" and to affirm that the government was more functioning as a kleptocracy than a government," according to the ambassador's note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a " krisha " (the term used in the criminal world/mafia that literally means " roof " or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow government.
"The analysts identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is spending the money of the largest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of MVD and FSB (not only organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high."
The note indicates that, although the collection of money is extended, protection itself may be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who don't pay quickly see their business close under a pretext or another.
Medvedev mentioned the fight against corruption several times, but he admitted little progress.
The embassy's note transmits income accounts to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview with Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indem" in Moscow.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the cost of corruption would rise to over $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was classified 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the note by the US Embassy, which had only been made yesterday, late in the evening, in Moscow time, will certainly remove the discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for the failure of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for Kremlin to show that he is solving the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin issued the assumption that WikiLeaks' documents could be a manufacturing and reacted furiously to the reports that US diplomats had disclosed by appellate Batman and nearing Medvedev of Robin.
"The problem is based on the fact that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that it would be realized with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, contrary to ethics."
The former Khmer fighters forced to face the past
In a class room badly lit with concrete walls of poor quality, the director of Anlong Veng's secondary school mentioned the man who had built it, the last head of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves your mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the mouth" for its brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Reds, this commander remains popular in this isolated base of former Khmers Reds in northwest Cambodia, where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of former troops of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers returned to the government, long-term loyalty was finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation enabled victims to face people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high-school manual that, for the first time, teaches the story of Khmers red to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly directed by the United Nations, issued its first judgment on a former Khmer member of the Red, condemning, at 35 years of imprisonment, the former head of the most notorious torture centre of Tuol Slang, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
Faced with this change in the situation, anxiety has increased among the former Khmer fighters in the Red of Anlong Veng, which complicates reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are feelings and fear among the former Khmers, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent agency that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Khmers was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the Khmer rule in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or were killed by hunger, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and reversed the government of Pol Pot-United in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements took place in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla of their base located in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a suite at Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a United Nations-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to deteriorate to the government, culminating with the capitals of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had taken the lead, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 awaiting trial.
Without their benefits, most of the former Red Khmer fighters were in black poverty, common in rural Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic in the movement.
Although some red Khmer elite officers have kept their positions as local leader in exchange for having deposited the weapons, they are not qualified farmers at the low level and file.
"These people have received very little follow-up after the surrender," said Sok Lang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are touched by the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in a framework where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sir Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Khmer Red as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice grower.
"Life under the Red Khmers was good," he said.
"It's Mok feeding everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to meet our own needs."
The Khmer Red Court has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court should begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former red Khmer minister.
The mandate of the court is to judge the senior leaders and the main perpetrators of the crimes, but he did not say whether he continued beyond those four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to Im Chaem, 64-year-old, former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the rule of the Khmer Red in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field near his wooden house on pilots, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun sheds long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Red Khmers.
If the court called her, she said she would refuse to go there.
"Cambodge is in peace and stability," she said.
"If there are more persecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defaced the Khmer Reds in 1978, also warned on several occasions that instability would occur if the court continued several suspects; although experts and historians object.
"Cambodge must cross a pit and bury the past, he said.
But to face the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation centre.
"The reconciliation in terms of khmer is to recognize the broken pieces, he says.
"We need to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the Government on the Red Khmers, "A history of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for higher schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Red.
As in most Cambodia, Anlong Veng's young people know only a few details about the Khmer Reds, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19-year-old student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book to the house to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They doubt because they don't know exactly how many people the court will pursue."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Lang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court begin to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Reds maintain a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a path, invaded by the bad grass and covered with plastic bags, leads to a black silk rectangle, covered with a rolled sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Noum Sothea, aged 31, a mobile phone vendor on the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was incinerated in this place.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she said.
It was the anniversary of Noum Sothea and, later that day, she planned to go to the last place of rest of Pol Pot where she would leave a bunch of mature bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus accepts to give up its military-grade uranium stock
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprising victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide
The agreement was published in a joint communiqué published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Sergei Martynov, in addition to a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have set the horizon in the last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that certain classified operations have been carried out with Belarus in the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military uranium from a research centre in Belarus.
This opened the way for a Wednesday agreement to eliminate the remainder of the matter of approximately 500 pounds, according to an official who referred to the condition of the anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the Obama initiative; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.
"This proves to me that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the World Security Partnership, a nuclear safety promotion group.
Clinton qualified the "very significant, important step" agreement made by Belarus.
Obama undertook in Prague in April 2009 to secure all nuclear materials that are worldwide vulnerable in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under George W. Bush's administration.
At the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexandre Loukachenko said the nation would never renounce its uranium.
"We have kept the uranium highly enriched, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-quality uranium and the uranium poorly enriched," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"It's our product... we're not going to make salt bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, by expressing an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the uranium in Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, said the officials.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and disposed of, reported the officials.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the authorities.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low-rich uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A small-scale coordination and organization have been implemented to strengthen confidence", thus leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Department of Energy Specialized in the Reduction of World Menace.
According to estimates at the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been strained for years, mainly due to the harsh repression by Loukachenko of Human Rights.
But Wednesday's statement would suggest a potential renewal.
"All by welcoming progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations; and essential to the country's and its citizens' progress," she said.
The government issued no objection to CIA flights
The government did not object to the CIA's flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners headed by Guantanamo across the Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US Ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the daily El País, which adds that the first vice-president of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they were adequately supervised by foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe, which was in charge of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to dozens of countries including Spain, there was a meeting between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández of the Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "was surprised by Zapatero's out-of-game government" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"From Vega he stressed that Spain has no objection with regard to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They only want to be informed" to prevent them from being "taken away," Aguirre reports in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even though, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited influence".
In turn, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the CIA's Department of Aviation Defence.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking to the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless expressed concern at "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the disclassified information of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to deal with the case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the US ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even though the Spanish judges are jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments from a burning rhetoric, trying to reduce the temperature."
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she said.
The Pariside that passed on to the eyes complained on the network of the "accomplishment" of being a mother
The young girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terreur a la Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as soon as she was little, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two origins of Noia, the village of the Coruña whose origin she was.
The messages date from 2008.
To hear them, we need to know his sentimental life, which ABC built with the help of his parents' testimony.
The 30-year-old Galician girl started a relationship with Iván Túñez in 1998.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, it was known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was with him, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
We found another new little friend shortly after that.
The elite was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring town.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the young girl went to the Balearic Islands to explore the labour market, the young girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But according to the content of its communications, it is understood that their idyllic has broken, they have separated.
In March 2008, she was alone in Minorque, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and old because I came to work there."
"When I told him, it showed him a good thing, but of course, he now takes into account what it means to be with the child all day long and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she talks about a mobile message she just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the child."
She complains, "If she doesn't like it, leave the girl with my mother, and I'll take it when I get back," she says.
In May, she spoke of the return to her village: "This week I am leaving, but I will only stay there until 19, because I have to introduce myself to a job so I don't lose it."
She explains that if everything was okay, she would have taken her old man with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that is to say with me, and I will never leave him my life with another person if this person is not my mother," suspicious intent, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there was another post.
When she tapped it, it was assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of this month, and he had allegedly been murdered on the 10th was dead.
"César is happy on the one hand, but he is not on the other."
"On one side he's with me and this place he likes a little, but on another one he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a move to Majorque.
"There will be (the child) in a few hours of summer and as this I'm saving some money from the baby-sitter."
17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss on Caesar's side, who asks me when will you come?"
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know which video to the e-mail, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
The 30th, another: "The child is well, he goes to summer to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there's one: "I'm getting ahead of money."
She has messages on the Internet in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the universe of MySpace, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the liberator of the prison."
"Terreur a la Galician (epigrapher) " .
The last man who lived with her, watchful, expresses his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything happened because she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, from the juvenile detention centre in Minorque.
Officer Carlos Maceda explained that she did not remember how the events had happened, "and she had no intention of harming the minor."
She had previously confessed that she had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited her body in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric trial.
Members of the People's Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MPs recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training receives in these double commissions is usually the one it receives in the Catalans.
As a result, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes in general in 2008, while in the 2006 autonomys they received 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend was maintained, which was desired by the PSC's turn of vote and the confidence of the PP electorate, the analysts calculated that, if there were general elections, the PSC could pass from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CIU would also win four (now 10) and PSC would lose no more than 9 MPs (at 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the population analysis, the ERC would lose a Member - he now has three - while ICV would keep a Member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal comics, where people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in their relations with the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the governments that manipulates the highest budget - EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and people agree that the PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would no longer have the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking account of the republican debacle, it would not be fantastic if this training lost its representation in the mayor of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes -.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
Populars have also recorded progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and is keen to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaida
In addition to the seven prisoners in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian officers of the General Information Office of the Police of Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, led by Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaida groups, including "Tigres for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Tiba" (Let), the last to be the author of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, in order to ensure that "the Kampai operation" has "debilitated" the Al Qaida falsification device at international level and therefore "its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, could send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that would integrate the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that its "combatants" could cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The decommissioned cell is the only one that the jihadist network has been operating in Europe, which is why other European police units participated in the investigations, except for Thai services, so in the territory of the European Union there might be the following days of similar hits as recorded on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (retained by Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another took place in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Siranglaya Kijbumrung.
They were those who led the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - one of which was hit in 2009 - was mainly the passports that met the conditions of the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents were to be on behalf of young men aged 25 to 45, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connect the detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar e Tiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports flying in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before the attack was committed, a number of thousands of dollars were sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency that was "invested" to purchase mobile cards that were used after the members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have come across a lot of documentation.
PP requests Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity to personally present to Arthur Mas his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign, and which sum up giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereign adventures such as the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wants to address half of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan Peoples came to the meeting with Arthur Mas with the assurance that he had obtained 18 MPs last Sunday, more than enough to love himself, because the CIU candidate needs at least one of the trainings that the opposition will hold in the polling of the investment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but for the time being, the conversations that Mas has today with the rest of the political leaders are being held in Catalan.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support an investment "it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereign and independent speeches", and economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque country - that the leader converging wishes to submit even to the referendum.
Both leaders share their common interest in increasing the political apparatus of a very excessive self-government and eliminating the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of Mas's investment negotiations will take care of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citudadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the dead were not due to the "no measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
Journalists La Caritat d'Olot (Gérone) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people who he was responsible for at the time he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the Centre's lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to carry out the charge against the responsible" for the dead, but "legality and responsibility force us to take over the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discrimination that the entity may suffer because it has not detected the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat is now taking the form of an important compensation that legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime of August 2009 and that he had not stopped killing since that day.
The judge mentioned in the judgment that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatrics - which he suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally explore the deaths but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality was by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures could at no time have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only an indication of impudence on the part of any other person who is not accused".
The person who was already baptized as the "Ange de la Mort" reported 11 murders earlier today, detailing that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused his death by injecting an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The Director of La Caritat mentioned that it is difficult to control the access of medical staff from the centre.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails were the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate internal suffering, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify if Vila does not lie in saying that he has sought for his first victims a less cruel death or otherwise burned them inside by giving them as he already knew he had done with the three women he killed in the 12-17 October period.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of reported murders, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is larger and justify their attitude by the various versions Vila made in her visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way she killed after successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
The investors reacted abruptly yesterday to the Trichet yesterday's threat that "the markets should not underestimate our response capacity".
The differentials in the devices have closed to the force and the shares of the European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to cheat and the euro has barely recorded an increment, which is an interesting signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that, in the same way as it shrinks, it recovers, but is motivated by closes of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be late in losing fear.
A month ago, the ECB called us today to withdraw liquidity measures and we will have to retire for the fourth time in two years and those remaining.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all outstanding long-term liquidity measures, leaving only unlimited access to the week.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least by March" and maintain the sale of quarterly unlimited access auctions at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity by the end of June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase programme and that we will even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent response of yesterday's markets and if they continue blind to withdraw the liquidity measures, which God helps us!
Just as during their meeting in May in which they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds and that they had crashed the markets, the story could happen again tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market collapse.
Yesterday's one-year treatment in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28 per cent compared to 750 million to 4.81 per cent of the previous survey.
Even so, the types in Portugal have reduced 30 base points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
The figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland were published in Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday next, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and there is not yet sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in an uncertain home.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wishes to interpret Wagner and the rest of the Hymne of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday with the plan of action approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, reduction of deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to re-activate employment sound like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange amounted to 4.5%, the double to the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the response of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefited from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a three-year commitment that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that this will be resolved with a strong demand and help spread doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to request a Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million available in cash, the triple compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to the healthy markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "besides being, show him".
Courage, we can get out of here!
The President of Eulen will challenge the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm never stops in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will contest him because he considers him to be "no right", the next 16, asked by five of his seven sons in which they will try to make their majority claim and take over the management bodies of the firm owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding for companies does not appear to be willing to surrender in his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
Out of his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year whose dispute is registered in the Register of Commerce and Societies.
El Enebro's judicial board for the next 16th, convened by the Magistrate Commercial Number 2 of Madrid, reopened the tonnerres box within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to set the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the assembly's convening.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "depressed appeal of the applicants' five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly violating the Law and by abuse of the right, to validate and correct the assembly radically void on 18 January", according to his official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the fact that, once the assembly has taken place, it will be challenged, considering that it is "no full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already failed to try that the magistrate convenes a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a corporation owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the service group seeks to use it over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This case is the substantive question that the judge must decide after hearing the application for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumph in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software creates improvements to real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this selective universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
In the first moment, no one took into account the options of a new hurdle that had just arrived, despite the upsurge of the last season, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all played on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the skill as a champion, German Sebastian Vette, no longer the engine driver Renault that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
In fact, this is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very far-reaching goals of high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly chains for global manufacturers, energy stations, high-precision tools.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding the possible defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of photo equipment from Canon, Sukhoi planes or the most famous Nissan utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Siemens Industrial Division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 plant has allowed Red Bull to create and run "in a short time, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that in 1992 there was an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four vehicle improvements each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young high-skilled professionals are working, who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and design any kind of changes on the bolides.
The director of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull's bolids except for the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
Changes can go from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological development there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech plant to create and produce its bolids in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
All that's going on down there is considered "top secret."
Staff for this duty count 580 people, including two pilots, the Vettel and Mark Webber champion.
The hero of Red Bull's Formula 1 is undoubtedly the recent Sebastian Vetell champion.
Among the vast technological resources that the energy beverage brand has put into service for its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and zero notoriety.
The manufacturer's technology director, Steve Nevey, said five years ago that R+D's progress in the case of racing cars was 50% of the wins and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of success, while pilots bring 15% of added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with his associate Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 trades between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave example of the remán store located on the Grand Via de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she worked for 30 years.
The North American Group has prepared a plan to deploy 200 brand points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish institutions.
The first openings were those in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one in Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she admitted that Madrid might be the next destination.
The Director of HM Personal Systems has ensured that the philosophy for the implantation of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American Group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of shops (with products that can be affected in an interactive way), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive trading network claims "to improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, post-sale and even packaging".
The Barcelona Store includes a space with a global pilot program that solves the potential problems of HP computer equipment in guarantee.
An online service is connected to a technical centre located in Maastricht, Holland.
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bets on "fly" a million customers at its rivers in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell's deputy administrator, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
In spite of this, it provides for a collapse in the margins of interest, which will be tried to offset partially with commissions' increments and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million special customers, his task.
Sabadell has found a way to operate over the next three years and can survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 which will hold a three-year maturity.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to use FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market share through the capture of a million new special customers - 700,000 if those who can get out of the bank - its great task is to carry out, as so far this bank has damaged SMEs and companies more than the particular client.
This year he has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity balance, or the same thing, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks are now reluctant to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the world banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalise his Optima Director Plan this year, established four years ago, even though the plan initially was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for an additional period.
Customers who leave savings boxes will be their main target.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "hard and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, thinks that the outcome of the crisis in Spain will be "slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the passive war - which penalises margins - is reducing, the price of risk premiums that banks and cash pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity is already moving at the credit price to compensate for the drop in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a pressure on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differences are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already ordered his network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differences - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also noted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase the commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth, even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he ensures that in Spain "we will ask for greater dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He argues that capital requirements are "extensively increasing" and some Spanish financial entity could enter red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in the acquisition of funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he has reduced the importance of the fact that some banks already predict a new liquidity crisis.
He said that it was not possible to issue, but rather than what happened in June, it was possible to obtain short-term funding through rest, which mitigated the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the cash registers
The ECSC Director General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of savings deposits and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the Spanish savings funds concentration process began, there were several entities that ensured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisse d'Épargnes (ECCA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been realized, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most have been fully realized; it is possible that, instead of 17 there are 13 or 14, all major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has also collaborated heavily in this operation," the leader stressed.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragon (ADA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is "at the greatest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is achieved in the times in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphatized.
"The passage of 45 cash with an average of 28,500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is an unprecedented trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be consistent with Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a number of rather unfortunate views on the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain has made is to remind us that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ensured that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world and has assigned it to people who doubt it to a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can stay very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings funds, a system that started a "very important" concentration process and "go at the greatest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had suffered from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the Union as a whole.
Market tensions have caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private placement or abolition agencies of the 426 euro for unemployed without a professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the State Lotteries.
Another, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel with regard to his responsibility to delineate the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which shocks with it to maintain the former traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary area.
The second is Mark's recovery, although it now seems to be science fiction, with a very favourable opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new concept of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, budgetary rigour, fines to countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of differences between what Germany thought should do (tax rigour and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel had difficultly extended the decision to save Greece.
Since then, it has been a fierce critic, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the publication were against Greece's rescue.
Finally, by the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties to enable a country to recover and at the same time compel private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European because it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, was approved and, in the following months, we should attend the reform process of the Union which makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we must now take measures with which we cannot agree too much, from that date on, the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which the countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to withdraw from payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a portion of the costs.
Germany tells us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
It's clear.
And it would be bad if you didn't hear it.
This is not just about restoring public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're asking is much harder.
And what he must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater calmness.
And that we know how to seize the opportunity that we have been given until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard of this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with large businesses and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticisms, the way to the the thesis that must be ordered to the house has been opened.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities envisaged, it cannot be excluded from leaving a monetary area that is too heavy from less serious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The Russians like Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show the ingenuity but not the will to escape a punishment.
The original expulsion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23 November match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused a lot of ink on the anti-sport character of such behaviour and whether both players should be punished by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the match (which their team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the arbitration to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will end up being the leader of its group, both players will perform the regulatory sanctions during the next match of the Auxerre Bar game and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned with two matches the team coach José Mourinho and various economic sums for the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in such circumstances as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
A part of the debate that appeared in the case is due to the fact that this has been the protagonist of a team of the real Madrid entity (which in its Hymne shows nobleness and honour and, on occasions past, has condemned a fine to its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, it seems by Mourinho, which adds an additional episode to its extensive history of historical and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether it is a fraud of the law with these actions; for indeed they are actions that are in conformity with the sport regulation, but seem to escape its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sports mind.
One of the assets that understand the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that with these actions has not been put at risk, i.e. there has not been a violent game.
Another of these assets to which we allude with the right game is to avoid the unfair use of the criminal player team, which is not the case anymore.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Royal Madrid players is that it does not fit to be characterized normally as fraud or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been made in secret to try to avoid punishment, but their action has specifically tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They waited and willingly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders gain from the intentional errors they are considering.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not gain an advantage in the same match no more, for of course the result of the action implies leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game anymore, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with some degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated all of a sudden and apart, with this action the players perform a penalty match and pass on to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than the first round.
So, recording the steps, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sport spirit, but they are part of the strategic decision-making that makes the most of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (it would in fact be a clear case of fraud of the law), but rather they chose the time when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without enjoying or fleeing the criminality.
Even though the border between the genius and the fraud of the law is widespread, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, appears because of two factors: because there were two self-exulsion and the way in which the directive was transmitted to provoke them.
The evil caused by the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates a lot of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bull and the lottery, when December comes, they also come back to dinner groups before Christmas, which continue to be the oxygen balloon for Barcelona's restaurants and entertainment, but which because of the crisis have resulted in a price-adjusted offensive to be able to catch the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinner or meals, coincides with businessmen and associations in the interviewed sector.
To complete accounting, this year's calendar (as the night of Saint Sylvestre falls on Friday) focused on requests in the week of 13 December, which has so far resulted in an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (17 and 17) and almost nothing last week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there have been many companies that have eliminated the collective dinner for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all demand battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauração de Barcelona, Gaietà Farrás.
The representative of the patronate, now, is not alone in predicting how the festivals will be held this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
"They want to get out, but they pay a lot of attention to prices," he says.
The case will be "for those who give quality at good prices and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a level with the crisis, so that the euro round has become majority in demand.
In a survey in various centres of the centre, the collapse of requests for the night of 17.
The Soteras Group points out that there is a genuine boom of applications for this Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economy, with full formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the speciality of the calendar has assumed more anticipated reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We made it impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they said.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, Quu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after having detected a wave of billing since the second semester and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends celebrating the festivals in advance.
At their six group menus they added one for the Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than the past year rather than demanding more details, such as the Catalan wine produced by the champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in certain companies invite their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased slightly.
On the part of the Pecasarm patronage (including entities such as the Bars Association, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, is in the position to begin to see the end of the tunnel and supports that reservations are "animated", although customers "negotiated at the most".
That is true, the hope for festivals has not diminished, regardless of who pays, indicate.
Pakistan ' s nuclear programme generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks filtration confirms the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy of Pakistan and the United States Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns posed by the Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
Apart from the clear and enjoyable details that offer about the content of talks and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistan nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main causes of concern in Washington.
This is how the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, states in a report prior to the visit of the former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations in the territory under attack by the Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials with short noise and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is considered, not only by the United States but also by Russia, as a proliferator and as a reason for maintaining custody.
"Pakistan has to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear installations; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear programmes or missiles," said expert Yuri Korolev, of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by the Julian Assange portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
A rush from the Embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", supports the following: "Transparency is often nonexistent; aid offers remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it clear to the responsible that "Pakistan's Army must end with tacit support to terrorist groups".
In pursuit of the chief of Wikileaks
Obama will count on a high level of responsibility for the anti-terrorist fight to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol sends a red alert to follow the movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have certainty about facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, this is not new, but it is the 20th of November.
And it has nothing to do with the last filtering of over four million United States diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australia faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks Creator's lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
The 20th international police force in Lyon (France) issued the order at Sweden's request, but it was not made public until yesterday after receiving the authorization of the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received an indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give the order to arrest an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the call to inform a freeway for arrest -- which the national police body must realize -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is thought to be located.
The movement incited Assange lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks, who was willing to respond by video-conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, that we compare him to the famous Lavrentity Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
"That seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the missive complains.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he is not.
On Monday, he gave an indeterminate interview with the director of the Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it has been responsible for giving orders to American diplomats that they wish the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the House-Blanche, Robert Gibbs, who described the application for resignation as "religious and absurd".
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a website should interest us," he told CNN.
Obama himself charged with a high responsibility for the anti-terrorist fight, Russell Travers, to prevent new leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, asked the Department of State to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and to continue to provide contributions or assistance to anyone".
Even further away came Tom Flanagan, a Canadian president's advisor Stephen Harper, who had to return to his statements after saying that Assange should "be murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something like that."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possibly a presidential candidate.
"The person in the Government who has filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," he said to Fox.
Puigcercos seeks peace in ERC with eye clinics at Carod fans
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet offers a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercos seems to have found the recipe to solve the 1st internal revolution within the ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it cannot give him any headaches that he had with other large currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticisms with eye clinics that allow him to wander to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercos announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to vote on his continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the Cardists want to drive a certain vote of punishment to the President, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the class leader wants to avoid the division image and submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself to be ratified with half more of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to Bulgaria" would not be good anymore.
The people close to Carod require the president to put his position at the disposal of the militia, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercos controls the maximum body among the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a road map until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic re-orientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercos in exchange for his promise to program the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders considered as a sure fact.
The leader of the ERC has acknowledged that the "polyphonie" affects stability and that its goal is to make once and for all the organization be able to wash its family room.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considering Puigcercós ideologist, the owner of Innovation thought that the leader would be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, two of them.
The first, "recomposit" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militia, i.e., includes new figures coming from the appropriate sector of Carod.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC be liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
It therefore advocates a reform of the statutes that enables congresses to be conducted through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was the obsession of the Puigcercos team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave led the management to review the assembly model at a specific status reform conference.
This meeting remains incomplete, as the internal tide in recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors in the future, the time could be good for it to be resumed and shut down forever.
23 implemented in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO State of Mexico, a decrease of 4 cases was recorded compared to 2010.
In November, 23 persons were executed in the state of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO of the state of Mexico.
These three women are mentioned among the murders and the discovery of two bodies cut in the Valley of Mexico.
During the previous month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
In some cases, a body found in San Diego of the Fathers Cuexcontitlan, municipality of Toluca, is mentioned.
The subject had at least three firearms and the head, except for the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The following day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of a vehicle abandoned in Mixtecas Street in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, of the municipality of Naukalpan.
Early Thursday morning, the four owners of shared land found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal fires in the thorax, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the sector that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
A message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana was found near the body.
One day after Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots of fire when he left his house to initiate the collection of orders.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a head-on impact of fire in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the fire blow in the front, a man's body was found on a solitary path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body was found a bullet of a 25-caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies have carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they have not been found.
The inhabitants of Tepotzotlán warned of the discovery of a corpse that was in Peña Colorado, the hands tied behind and the eyes tied.
The man had a wound caused by a blow of firearm in the nuke.
In the mid-month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in covers and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapan of Zaragoza was reported, at the same time as the victims of two death warning messages.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valley de los Reyes colony in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the nuke, one found the body without a woman's life in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
The woman's skin was detected with Santa Muerte's tattoos and necklaces with her image.
By the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the edge of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three hits and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their head rounded up and a message was found in the community of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "This is what happens to those who do not align themselves."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside a taxi abandoned behind the St Augustine Colony Justice Centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first one had been decapitated in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached to a canal rubber and a message next to it; while the second one had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Next to him, the officers found a Bristol with a message.
China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of that country in COP16 has ensured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and has detailed that it maintains its bid to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its bid to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, providing Su Wei, a representative of that country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei ensured that its country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, in the last four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been recorded in all these areas, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives discussed with regard to greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities worked in a coordinated manner with governments and locals to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (United Nations), the Government and the private initiative, has been mentioned.
There is also a provincial project for climate change, another for the change of incandescent lamps by economic lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the government of that country with regard to climate change, ensured that China's efforts were greater than it thought.
For example, the per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 per cent of the historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national PAN leader explained that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, has ensured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was legal and that the former Paniste leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In his previous interview with Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, Espino's expulsion is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, by making a complaint to the National Council's Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, it clarified that this is not the time to think in 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Action Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections of 4 and 5 December where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, that was an approach for the successful local elections and achieved its objective," he said.
The Paniste leader mentioned that PAN was supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition doesn't scare us; rather, "we taste it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council would no doubt elect the best leader(s) needed by Action National for the next three years, so he would give the answer "to the person determined by the council."
"I'm completely quiet and open, I'd be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He predicted that the resumption recorded by the party in the elections last July 4th will be reflected in the next dispute, even though "it is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"For the time being it is to accompany Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that come out of alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that there was "a lot of hope for them, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the height of expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticisms against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the priests to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas of Gortari.
"If PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they start defending them; that they come out of 'armor'," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive could make expressions like those made in his speech in the National Auditory, because in the country there is no balloon, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes the law for students without papers on Twitter
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté said the US President in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today met with national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize students without papers, with a message in his personal account on the social network Twitter.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté Obama said.
Its short message maintains a cyber link with a broader document that calls on the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the increase in taxes in Bush's time and government funding were prolonged.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax problem is resolved, an agenda could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given time and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Senate's democratic majority, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he was going to ask for a "conclusion vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legitimize undocumented students could be voted on from Thursday in the Senate, even if it was most likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Réve Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they remained in that country for the past five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But the participants need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the partisan organizations of the protagonist project have an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska said he would vote against and only a Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the participants in the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most polite Republicans there are senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and senator from George Lemieux, Florida, who completed his mandate as Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not so far defined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree with the fact that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature we put the finger on the wound
The second stage of the Plaisirs of the Language was a walk in which the participants set out the narrative
"The sex in the language, I understand, but... the finger on the plague? what do you expect of me?" asked author Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and this time used the sub-title of her question (for another time the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained it).
The finger on the plague"...we put it in the embarras," gently launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young people who had gathered at the International Book of Guadalajara (FIL) Forum to listen to this moderate table by Marisol Shultz and who participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa as the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "plaice" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only the clues in the same narrative line.
Of the infectionologist she is convinced: "The patience is not my strength, it may be my plague."
Finally, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the color, but who explains to him that plague is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the plague is what is opened in reality, the symbol is the scar".
The protagonist sighed and concluded: "On the plague I only knew that it is open in reality and that it does not exist," but convinced by the fact that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very linked.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a thrilling narrative he titled Eloge to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but is discovered at a given time.
With the touch of magical reality, he spoke of a sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back people who had gone far or repaired the virtues of a lady who had lost, a story that turned to talk later on to America, the great news he had had at the beginning of his own time, and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo as criticizing the excessive narratives of the competing captains.
"Cervants who invented us all (the writers) laughed at false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way one would never have told the story of America with an imagination that lacked even the power."
However, he pointed out that "fools and liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, we no longer know which part of the story belongs to a band or another, where fiction literature reaches its apoge.
It's actually called the 'Tradition of Cervantes'.
"It's because of his heritage that we're what we count on."
In turn, author Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the FIL's invitation with its round table The duty on the wound.
The Cuban-Portorician has focused on the great plague of social violence that her country is experiencing - and Latin America shares - has produced disputes about trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think that the good literature, the good poetry the good songs refer to a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also stressed "it must be on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at great speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turn to the advantage of dogmatisms, "after each claim there is a little no and after each denial there is a little yes."
"To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means much of putting the finger on the wound and disrupting people who feel very comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuances, and also disturbing the powers that prefer a white and black world," he said, inviting to recover the meaning of writing.
Romano hunted for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three faults in the finals he had high and low in his career, but he was able to reach the final series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that are faced, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast between them marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three faults in the finals, he has had high and low in his career, but he has been able to reach the final series three times, even though so far he hasn't put in the thousand and that's why this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentina ended up comforting itself with the sub-moon medal, it remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played successful finals.
The holyst strategy came to its first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held Morelia's reindeer with which he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in 2003 he also arrived at the final due and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and that was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, Rubén again suffered a relapse, because his team had a match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he gained an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players lost 11 meters and he suffered the leap as a result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Rojos Diablos and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournament, so he doesn't want to have the same fate, he tries to get rid of the evil to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he says that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, it's not for a passion that I have, and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," said the driver when he was asked what would be his weak points in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can hold is that until the referee simmers the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run, and I think that this is a lesson, before the end of the game we cannot celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to end in a regular time, but sometimes we only prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anxiety of keeping the title between our hands, hands has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this purpose and we hope that we will not get to this situation again."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining the visa
People must go to the Visa Applicants Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting will be reduced.
With effect from 10 January 2011, the procedure for processing visas at the United States Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to submit themselves to the Visa Applicants Service Centres (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be revised by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have some advantages for the aspirants, including the following:
The total cost of treating the visa will be lower, no longer will be necessary to make a payment for a meeting, another payment for the treatment of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a unique payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain the same: $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas on request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for traders and investors visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visas will not have to present themselves for an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only present themselves to the closer ASC where they will present the documents and be printed.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the ASC, applicants wishing to meet for a second meeting to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants to the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra $26 duty rate.
For further information on the new procedure for requesting visa, please visit the following page: http://mexico.usebassy.gov/bolettines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The space agency of the United States called the press to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will present tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow, 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for astrobiology experts, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA ensured that she would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which led to speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that we thought were uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that we thought was too coming for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creation uses arsenic as a way of living and this ability makes us think that a similar life might exist on other planets that do not have our volunteer atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of discovery at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will take part in the geobiology of Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who is studying Titan (Saturne's largest satellite), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
German PRD, PT, Convergence and Block
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of the 'bipartism' is possible, we are denouncing.
In the 1960s, it was only when in Congress a opposing bloc led by MPs PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tonnaïn' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, have they repeated, the 'bipartism' is being launched because now there are two people, from the same number of parties, who control Congress.
The four MPs, next to Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, the coordinator of the PRD, were the only to vote against the Directorate-General chaired by PANIST Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to PAN and PRI representatives to modify the schedule by political will and if they did not, they would be once again served by both parties and thus end the opposing coalition.
"Since this happened (the opposing coalition), that is what I am looking at, because we are excluded from any decision, they have not even the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia, mentioned that there are coincidences with PRD, PT and Pattern and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow it to continue that the Congress, after being monopolistic, is now "duopolitic".
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent has said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that the Congress now turned into a 'butin' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Mr Montalvo asked to respect the Member's personality, to give his place to the negotiating tables.
"If they do not leave us with collective agreements outside 5 which are likely to be 9 Members, now at five that we see, separated into different fractions, we have decided to join us to look for a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have made, that they have decided, that we are outside and that we disagree with this reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Mairie de Mazatlán pays another check to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 miles of weight for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Mairie.
With this, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 miles.
According to the City's Transparency Page, the last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 billion 144.56 pesos, in terms of "providing account liquidation".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Community would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State's Higher Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what he needs, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last Czechs "repatriated" the last quarter of the year: September 24, October 15, October 19, October 29, and November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other Governments from using its services, the Treasury has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All of this, after 25 July in the Northwest, had published a review of the cheques issued by the Mairie to its suppliers, revealing that in the period March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennat of Major Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the paying municipality of Camacho Palazuelos has more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, covering checks of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be cared for
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a crossroads of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in bad conditions and design a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly asked for the image of the destination to be cared for and that new activities should replace the others who the tourists find bad.
He said that the bad state of the streets and sidewalks had affected as tourists came to walk there and saw the disorder and avoided close trades.
"Politicians don't know what it means to shut down a business one day and they don't know the fortune you're lost, otherwise they didn't do the work for so long and without adequate planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist crash exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance of the Mairie side.
"The municipality will have to take on its responsibility and avoid this happening again, how to do so, so through a preventive interview and not only correcting it," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and Mary needs to change her strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it not only depends on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has the property in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"We didn't pay attention to them, and this kind of fact emphasizes something that is known to everyone, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, secretary of Tourist Promotion, said that the recovery of Mazatlán's tourist sites is urgent because they are not used properly and design a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put together with the municipality and be a priority for having the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Happyly Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that should be ordered, cleaned and put on the line to make them attractive to be able to add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP Request for Results in Congress
Mr Davalos, President of the CEC, proposed that the Members take great responsibility for being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges they face.
The business sector in Mazatlán seeks a decent and free labour legislation between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is overwhelmed and is facing major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th legislation was established by seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergence and one from PVEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress are a clean and committed management with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same model of party or patronage does not repeat itself.
Mr Davalos, President of the CEC, proposed that the Members take great responsibility for being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges they face.
"We hope that the Members actually exercise their right, free of agreement between the parties, because the custom is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and they turn into a carnival mask of the governors and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask them to confirm their commitment to establishing the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
"We will ensure that they do a decent and primarily engaged work with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives was to push and add forces by seeking the economic growth of the state, because the economic situation is now very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they increase economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and this will in a way stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the importance he had in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat for Government Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important and generating economic activity of currencies and investment that directly competes with the agro-industry."
In addition to the fact that resources must be classified into detonating tourism projects that help the State to provide relief and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislations have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for a king of magic.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, including toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of Kings Mages will be difficult to carry out their illusions, because their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will carry the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live today because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and after-morning I go out with the 'plebes' to sell in the street," says Caietana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the kids.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her 3-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
In his turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo longs to have a 'monster truck' and for his 8-month-old brother, Jesus, Cayetana suggests size clothing for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, son', because he was very expensive," he recalls with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
11-year-old Maria Guadalupe has a 12-year-old shoe; 10-year-old Isaiah has a 10-year-old shoe while 8-year-old Miguel has eight-year-old shoes.
José Juan, aged 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help realize the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the On Search King Mage campaign, giving a toy or money at the Northwest reception.
14 drug trafficking suspects arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Austria on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of haschich, silver and equipment used for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for Québec Security.
All in all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees were to be compared to the Sherbrooke courthouse in the hours following their arrest.
They could face allegations of cannabis production, possession in order to traffic, plot and steal services, among others.
These investigations were carried out following a long-haline investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It is information received from the public that has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Module of Québec's Estrie de la Súreté, Sherbrooke Police Service and Memphrémagog Police Department took part in this police operation.
Clandestine migration can continue without problems
The draft law of the Conservatives, which the Government says should address the problem of illegal migrants, is obviously to be fought when the three opposition parties indicated on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly support the Charter."
"I'm standing with a party that created granite under your feet," said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by Members after the weekly Caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow a person to hold up to one year from a ship identified as a carrier of illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he took it to the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticism that her party was not strong enough about illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democratics agree to take action against clandestine passengers and that is what we do through another bill, C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it takes refugees and incarcerates children for at least one year," explained Ms. Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians say massively to the MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country as a strawberry."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections in the event of its rejection.
A conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that every opposition MP would then explain himself to his electors.
The new unit does not do the same.
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collapse by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public investigation committee on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, maintains that this idea does not date yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Research in New York on this matter from last January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Québec police services, on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite Robert Dutil's presence.
It was no longer necessary for the Pakistani public security critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this ad "lapin out of a hat" and a "brikled solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil replied to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we announce it, is he happy to say it?"
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"More Mr. Charest insists on not wanting to set up this committee of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he therefore suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate corruption and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, enabling him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent escort is not the only project in the charters of the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, was now thinking about some of the amendments related to this case.
During the Spring 2001 operation, which hit the motorcycle groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
High surveillance rivers
Several water courses remain under high surveillance due to the heavy rainfalls that have taken place in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landing took place on Wednesday afternoon, in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another glazing would take place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
There's been a road crash.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
From 20 to 40 millimetres of extra rain were expected by Thursday night, depending on the regions.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouai valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
As these precipitations must be added to the already accumulated snow source in some sectors, several water courses are being feared.
Warnings of flooding alerts were issued on Wednesday night by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouereau and Achigan Rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in St. Jerome, in the Laurentides, and in China, in Lotbinière, were the subject of floods and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, strong rainfall led to the landing of certain lakes in Sainte-Julian, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
At Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measures.
In Ottawa, the landing of some lakes led to the closure of several roads, including in the municipality of Mansfield- and Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on a alert foot and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
For its part, the Centre de Prévision des crues du Québec has issued on Wednesday the warnings of strong cruces for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouraau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Loup.
Partially blame dupont
Québec Radio Animator Stéphane Dupont went through a partial reverse with the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) on controversial issues about social assistance and Haitians as well as on its large-scale wave language.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some of the issues contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unmistakably negative representations of Haitians and wholesale language that did not match broadcasts during the day".
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Joint Front of Social Assistance in Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were incorrect.
Animators must present solid information rather than frauds.
As for suicide, the animator Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a gesture of release.
Most members of the Committee concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes of "Duppet the Midi" have dealt with a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
Therefore, no blame has been taken into place.
The last dispute covered statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were then delivered to a media-faced face that had caused many reactions.
CHOI's animator stated that he had made no donations to help the Haitians because it was not possible to know for sure that the needed people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an indisputable negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already had my three-day suspension over there."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," said the animator.
In all decisions, the Committee deplores the widespread dissemination of language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM radio broadcaster collaborated "in addition to its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which, among other things, will have to announce these decisions once during the hours of great listening within three days.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
The Algerian Montréal of origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing goes up on the tatamisms and rings of the world looking for new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria, Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve in professionals."
"In my case, I'm trying to fight a little everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground in mixed martial arts, the competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security agent and as a commission for the UPS has just released bad news to its rivers, winning two gold medals at the World's World Amateur Carate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing, he explained."
"Now, I'm getting ready to go to China for the World Cup of San Show."
"The combatants who ended up among the first four at the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the fifth grade tournament, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made progress at every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san show" or "sand" is a discipline originating in China where punching and footing, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
The duels initially take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous Pugilist from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well-known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most famous and prestigious in China, explained the friendly galillad."
"It's a little equivalent to the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stage in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, half-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the end.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, did he analyze."
"There are four combatants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The semi-finals winners face their category at the end."
"Then the winners of each category are faced to crown a single champion, the king of the kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec granted $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor that has obtained the most important, that of project management, for a sum of $295 million without calls for tenders.
This consortium called Energy Management was formed in 2004 in conjunction with the Hydro-Québec choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important 5 billion-dollar hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium decoupled the profit-making contract without calling for public tenders.
For the Quebec Party, the use of companies' consortia poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and cause price increases.
"It's the new way to make a collision and to defeat competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing so in secret, now make it open," said Pakistani MP Sylvain Simard yesterday at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the question to the National Assembly because he said it was difficult to see how the public interest could be used in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was a collision for this contract.
"I began to have my journey," she said, claiming that the PQ had been "unhonested" and had "missing hard".
She said "it would be the least of things" that the PQ apologized for.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
This is usually a limited alliance in time that allows two or more companies to group their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project includes a high level of complexity in view of the scope of the work.
The construction site is underway and is to be phased out until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition game acting; there was negotiation.
Thus, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week by Le Devoir, the formulation of consortia in the engineering sector is under investigation in the government.
A quick overfly of the Québec Business Register allows to number more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Rock and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and even moral person, or Dessau.
With regard to the energy management consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is responding to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding specifically to it since the 1970s".
The major patron of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the Energy Society of Baie James (SEBJ), explained that the project's management contract was granted freely.
"If you go for offers and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people in this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that this is not the price that is important, that is the competence of people," said Mr Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 from the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir had 109 engineering and consulting contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has acquired 22 contracts, Geneva has won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, with no participation in Energy management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449 783,344, including the contract in Energy management of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard said that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau left it to me that the PQ was also linked to these "funding" firms before stating that it was rather his leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also in the equitable brands and environmental certifications to guide its choices.
Pis, even if he is in a media universe where the messages in favor of more responsible consumption are pulsating, he deplores a lack of credible information, because he even calls a brake on his commitment, indicates the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even though they have increased the consumption of products said socially responsible in 2010, the Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies, as well as the green advertising of companies, reveal the measurement tool developed by the Observatory for Responsible Consumption at Sherbrooke University.
Another finding is that half of consumers have doubts about the reliability of official certifications based on the said products, but also about the credibility of products and brands that appear to be eco-responsible, says Barometer.
In the same vein, the speech of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec people.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be essential to stimulate this diet, which is now being promoted by almost one third of Quebec's consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the suspicious nature of the information would calm the fires of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of the Quebecers say that they are also suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services they are trying to put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to change their habits and above all changed their brand of one or more products to respond to their conviction.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases to traders in their neighborhood and favoured the purchase of food products grown in their region, says Barometer.
More green and responsible - the responsible consumption index reached 64 to a maximum of 100 for this year - , Homo consumus du Québec likes to appear as the king of recycling who is trying to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
However, his social and environmental consciousness seems to remain outside his car, says Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used the transportation in common or recommended co-moting to defend their green interests.
The march and bike were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral investigation, which had just taken its first click.
A loan from the State for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, who was asked to engage financially in the purchase of the eXcentris film complex by the Angus Society and the Parallel, agrees to cooperate, but in the competition of only one loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, who were expecting a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex on the Saint-Laurent boulevard by giving it its full cinematic vocation, did not get what they claimed.
The government agrees to be involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan of less than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources from the State offices.
A first action plan and an application of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have since been reviewed at a low level.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who is driving the eXcentris file.
He got him a last report a dozen days ago.
But the counter-proposal of the cabinet arrived at SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the gift of the State must really be removed.
Let us recall that the Association of Cinemas and Cinéparks Owners of Quebec was opposed to a direct government investment to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it has not done for other cinema rooms.
However, a number of environmental stakeholders claimed substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of the sky, for ten years carried the author's film in his complex premises after financing himself his construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is creating in Montreal, and eXcentris had its loyalty to its clientele.
The Angus Society and the Parallel, with their head Christian Yaccarini, pilot, on their side, a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to drive the acquisition wheel.
Since spring 2009, one of the three screens, Le Parallele, has continued to broadcast films to eXcentris.
The purpose of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms next February 27th by designing the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we ignore what he and his group think of proposals at the bottom they are made to them.
The veil raised on a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks raise the doubt that the United States considers Canadians to be the inferiority complex to Americans, but at the same time they betray the feeling of superiority of the latter to Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that each Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by voting and believe that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, located in the public square yesterday, offer more cross-cutting details than the substantial content to be put under the tooth.
A cable dated 22 September 2008 is in the federal electoral campaign, relating to what extent the United States is not part of the issues discussed by the political leaders.
To the great surprise of the US Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers a few explanations to this situation.
"A complex of almost inherent Canadian infertility may require Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of the day rather than make this election on the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
The United States therefore concludes that "the elephant probial of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it".
The ambassador understands from the very least this "stupid silence" that both countries have a strong political and economic relationship.
"Providedly, does he consider the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more than one party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor for voters to vote on?"
The other expression of this sense of importance lies in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival at the beginning of February's vote of confidence on the federal budget, by which Canada will display its first deficit over a decade due to a resumption plan of $30 billion to $40 billion," wrote Mr. Breese.
No mention was made of the fact that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to avoid being reversed by the coalition and that the opposition parties made their conditional survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, prevents Washington from becoming increasingly negative than the drama series broadcast to CBC from referring to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA's arrests for muscle interrogations are observed.
Another cable relates that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "He sent a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, let's note that the spirits fail about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on the CBC waves that the responsible for this massive escape should be "killed".
Mike Huckabee was shocked in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renewal of Light
The United Nations proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan for the renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas reduction (GES) that corresponds almost to one third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún in order to compensate for the absence of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to yesterday's plan, if the incandescent ampoules that monopolies still from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluo-compact ampoules or, better, by electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED") ampoules, the main of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, major issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should lead to global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will have to be removed from this budget another 5 Gt to stabilize the 2-centigrade climate by 2020 in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In the incandescent ampoules, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, is produced from light.
With fluo-compact ampoules, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new DEL ampoules, this need for energy is reduced twice again.
Fluo-compact ampoules last from 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
New pumps in DEL, such as those launched by Philips manufacturer this week - this company has also participated in the study of the United Nations - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the economy possible with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All these new ampoules can also work with reeostats, as well as very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have made reservations to the place of fluo-compact ampoules as they contain mercury and have to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluo-compact ampoule, but rather the thermal power plants in coal, which emit a lot of mercury to produce spent electricity in incandescent ampoules.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, or the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire looks forward to the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requested the publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire without delay, after the deadlines had expired.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results without delay," he said.
"He calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to demonstrate responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission allowed the Friday afternoon's deadline to be spent without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's vote.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the Chairman of the ICE had stated on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied in the world on Wednesday so that the CEI finally proclaims the name of the winner of the second round between the exit Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp has been counting on the abolition by the Constitutional Council of "fraud" votes in the north, held by the ex-rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the coup d'état failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian President, said that the intimidating practices of the UN voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's party from going to vote.
All elections could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were retained by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who derails all ties with the former rebels, considered the delay in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he claimed the victory.
His allies claimed that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew that he had lost and that it would be illegal to complain to the Constitutional Council after the election commission had prevented the dissemination of the results.
The second round of the presidency, Sunday, was intended to crown the process of reconciling and reconciling a country that remained divided in two years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alaska Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédie (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France at the 3rd quarter
The rate of unemployment in France as defined by the International Labour Office (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolis (9.7% with overseas departments), showing the corrected seasonal variation data (CVS) published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in metropolis.
Data in the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in metropolis and 9.7% with DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate appears at a higher rate of 0.1 points.
More generally, 3.4 million people in Metropolitan France did not work at the third quarter but wished to work, whether or not they were available in the two weeks to work and whether they were looking for a job or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has still deteriorated, with a new increase in the unemployment rate, bringing to 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including DOMs.
At the third quarter, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 years of age were unemployed in the sense of IBT.
The elderly experienced a slight increase in unemployment, 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 points over three months and one year), or 482,000 people 50 years of age or older, and 6.6% with DOMs.
Only 25-49 years have benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 point in three months, +0.1 point in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a discussion on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union Statistics Agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini reviewed and detained
Alexandre Guerini, 53 years old, leader of the PS President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône, was examined and destroyed at the Luynes stop house near Aix-en-Provence in an investigation into alleged fraudulent public markets.
Alexandre Guerini has been examined for the abuse of social property, the diversion of funds and public property, recoil, active corruption, trafficking in influence and detention of ammunition, reports his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and tends to explain all the questions the magistrate will ask him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue it for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it's another thing to prove them," he told the AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guerini, a strong man's brother of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, held, through his lawyers, to pass a memo before his hearing in order to explain.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezi, was also examined on Wednesday night and scrutinized.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but to make the discharges he had to manage.
As to the award of the markets or the destination of the funds related to their operation, he never knew of them, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Aubagne Aglomation Services, was examined on Wednesday for the diversion of public and complicity funds, and released under judicial control with the prohibition of meeting the actors in the case.
"My client has been able to provide explanations of the facts that have reproached him."
"The teacher's magistrate took it into account not to deprive him of freedom," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released on Tuesday to Wednesday night, with the provision under judicial supervision for two of them, stated the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for the Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is being pursued for "trafficking and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Briguier's agglamation, are under review one for "the distribution and diversion of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity of the diversion of public funds".
Finally, the company of Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "revelation of the abuse of social property".
Among those who have been confronted with Mr. Guerini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently found in a parallel case of fraudulent public markets affecting the Corse.
The investigators suspect that their companies have served to whiten out the money of the great banditism.
The investigation is carried out in the context of several open legal information against X in April 2009 following anonymous mails, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public markets, particularly in the waste chain.
From a close source of the investigation, the investigations focus on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a La Ciotat discharge, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as certain cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée has exacerbated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss's fate, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", held the Haleine opinion in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the eye of U.S. diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by the World reveal some under this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going to give them advice on the treatment of their own "totage" crises in Iran (a small group of randomists).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French had not had to counter the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by American justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put themselves under a harsh light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to credit the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
The Director of the Elysée for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Qai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, are dealing with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise the Americans to do so to repatriate their own nationals held in force in Iran.
"Fates of noise," they say, "martling continuously" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocent", "immediate release".
It is necessary to overthrow the Iranian regime, which is sensitive to its image.
"Do it as much as the Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because, in the past, the attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "the silence will rule nothing", the Iranians are "masters in dilatarian maneuvers".
Mr. Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "a family Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss' prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day she took refuge in the French Embassy) "will require payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (EUR 230,000).
And he tells us that the Elysate anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that will "get worse".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains locked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose US proclaims extradition for illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released to Paris on a judge's decision.
The US Embassy, like many observers, questions this disturbing coincidence.
The expansion of Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, which tracks the Iranian nuclear material acquisition networks.
Did France accept a marketing offer?
The release of Iranian against French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
Elisée, he said, not only "was completely surprised by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There have been live exchanges between the French Presidency and the Guard of Sceaux" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the decision" judicial, he observes.
Mr. Richier also wanted to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remained under the "strict" surveillance of French information services.
The advisor of Elysée consists of a telephone number, which is attached, and then informs the American diplomat that Iran "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not take up its efforts, through communications and "flows" organized in the media, to make it clear that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "significant" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and they find that manipulation bears its fruit as several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media "blitz" of French officials".
What is the basis of so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, asked for the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their full statements of praise, French officials recognize in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then focuses on the reasons that led the Elysate to pay in this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "to validate Sarkozy's opening policy in Syria", he analysed.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and immemorial".
In "exacting the Syrian role", Paris seeks "to demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The objective is also to "sow seeds of disagreement between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows it's a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him, "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"That should at least sow confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her to Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans last midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a "Cendrillon" law that will prevent teenagers from playing online after midnight by blocking their access, government officials indicated.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under 16 years of age, have reported representatives of the ministries of culture and the family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the departmental head in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, has it specified.
The Government also intends to ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents demand it, added the responsibility.
It will also make available people who advertise free software that will limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world games competitions online.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, with 58 other nations.
Global 2018-2022: Fifa designates host countries
In full because of suspicions of corruption, Fifa's Executive Committee designates Thursday the world Cup organizer countries 2018 and 2022, a particularly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying are at risk of taking action on technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of Fifa's queen competition will take place in Europe, traditional base of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to acquire new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its deployment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of the Belgian and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political issues of a World.
The treatment in coils is therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to Fifa's assessment report, English, Hispano-Portugal (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be very difficult for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, in the light of the revelations that led to the suspension for the corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, a football club that won the World only once, in 1966.
The BBC released a layer on Monday, broadcasting a documentary containing three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Why bother the Fifa and put the English leaders in the cage, who have been engaged in intense lobbying in the last few weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of the government hopes to re-edit the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who won the JO-2012 organisation in 2005 for London.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to reduce the blow of England to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack anything with its already ready stages, its expertise (World-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its foot culture.
But the dark economic and financial perspectives of the two countries could shower their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's share, which has become a weightier despite the shortcomings of its file (states, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and denounced "disloyal competition in the preparation of the vote", in an allusion to the accusations of the English press against EC members.
"They're covered in mud, they're trying to compromise," said Mr. Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appeared to be the logical favor.
The first world economic power, seat of the main sponsors of the Fifa, seems to have a long-standing lead on Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear to be premature for two countries that co-organized the trial in 2002.
Another threat: the grant of the World 2026 to China, which was strongly desired by the Fifa, which would make the Asian chances for 2022 in fact run out.
With Qatar, which came out of the big game by offering futuristic stages, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion towards new confrontations, but these two countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of the TV rights achieved (due to the hourly decline) by the European countries, the nerve of the war for the Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitated.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac didn't have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than them.
One mandate to the Elysate calls it another.
So the current head of state will be candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not make a good house with the part of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So it has to be done as if there was still a doubt.
In one way or the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a heavy air, Nicolas Sarkozy would ensure that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
That he calls in front of the UMP MPs, Tuesday night at Elysée, so the perspective of "two mandates" was a little febrile.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far away.
The president only recalled that the 2008 constitutional review limited the number of five years to two.
He was making a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he mentions the President, on the tone of humor, in such meetings.
"Unfortunately, or best of all, you've still been with me for seven and a half years," he launched them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't believe I don't think about the next step."
His earlier talk makes him no longer a candidate than he does; they do not make him less.
If they make comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to the application to the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not Ségolène Royal's high school that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal.
On the contrary, it is because its 2012 candidacy is obvious that many in the PS are calling for an order of battle earlier than planned.
Bad surveys, on the other hand.
For the first time, right voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46%) versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express.
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP above," the Prime Minister immediately and wisely responded.
"If he believes the possible defeat, he will not be candidate," confides Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe that he can win," corrects Alain Juppe, renouncing the evidence.
Euro: The ECB is forced to maintain its acquisitions of State securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the way out of the crisis or, at least, to announce the conclusion of a number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that must be completed by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis must, the Frankfurt Institute of Emissions will certainly not be able to be as permanent as it is in the process of exacerbating a situation more than it is today in the European compulsory markets.
The political cost would be much higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, by increasing, for example, its sovereign bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my reflection on my European partners (...)".
In Brussels, at the hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any interest in his intentions, and he was pleased to note that the programme for the purchase of State securities in the secondary market "was continuing" and that "we will see what we will decide" at this Thursday's meeting.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main unchanged management rate at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the Treasury bond purchases by the ECB doubled last week, almost EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt that market operators are expected to continue their purchases (see page 29).
Economists no longer expect any significant change.
If lending operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter is still subject to unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine how much she's changing her program."
"If this were to take the risk of creating new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive release announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipated by Norbert Brams, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
On the basis of its interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to encourage an atoll market," Norbert Brams added.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"He needs to replace himself at all costs with the lack of market investors and to do so to prevent a package of performance paid by the most fragile states," testified an important mandatory manager yesterday.
For if interest rates run, the States will be much more inclined to reduce their debt, or stabilize it.
The saving of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government made the back round
After a start of a worrying week for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed, yesterday, with a 10-year-old return on compulsory rates.
A return to the precautionary calm.
On leaving a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti qualify for the "indecipherable" situation and expected a "unpredictable" weekend, which the interested party then denied.
On Tuesday in any case, the gap with the long German rates had reached the record of 210 basic points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had flowd to 263 points, leading to a certain flood in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the difference with the German rates was above 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, declared himself "strongly concerned" by "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atonin of tax revenues that goes with, making the State at risk of being unable to meet its funding needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the current budget for the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates that the public deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (against 3.9% foreseen by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
From this, the rumor of a new budget collection that could be put in place after the festivals, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The basics of his economy are in order and his accounts are good, we repeat it for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund for Italy to the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate future, either in the short term or in the long term, because despite its important debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), Italy's demand for stabilisation efforts are less than those requested in other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD head economist.
The issue of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
A period of time would then be less conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde still martyred her yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe, have demonstrated her on Sundays and at night, are obviously solid, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary area."
Although all related, yesterday's rest on European State obligations has brought water to the mouths of governments and the ECB.
But we still cannot talk about a beginning of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt note, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs on banking systems in particular," says Exane BNP Paribas economists.
More than "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it poses, the European countries are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis devices.
Informal consultations among the most directly concerned Finance Ministers and, more generally, with their G20 peers are going well.
This is also the case for meetings of the European Group and of the Ecofin from the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market-collimator (see above).
As regards the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the external-oriental investors of the crisis development in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first EDF securities issues are scheduled next month.
Yesterday, an official representative of the United States entrusted to the Reuters agency that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional IMF direct commitment.
The first-line countries, Portugal and Spain, as regards them, are ready to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organization.
Reforms that add to closer austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to borrow a different path from those in Greece and Ireland.
Each of them has to avoid asking for international assistance before introducing its own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms necessary to build lasting confidence.
Finally, European fundraisers address options available to speed up the process of standardising sovereign bonds markets.
On 24 November in Paris, Axel Weber had the first idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, an actor of any first plan of the European sovereign debt market, believe that a span of about EUR 100 billion would suffice, "preference" in the form of a direct liquid injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with EUR 60 billion to date.
An advice that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and glass: 24 departments in orange surveillance
The snowy episodes are still causing traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Britain, and are likely to disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange surveillance due to the risk of snow and glass.
The Time, the Time and the Loir, the Two-Sèvres and the Vienna, have been added to the 20 departments already in orange surveillance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, later at night.
According to Metéo France, sustained snow conditions affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows slightly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, at a time of 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, up to 5 cm for the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Low Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snowy episodes are notable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were prohibited from weighing more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lanion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult according to the gendarmies who recommend taking its vehicle only if necessary and the traffic of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measure was envisaged on Wednesday night to limit heavy weight movement.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly".
The Civil Aviation Directorate (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel their flights on Thursday 25% of their flights to the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to future snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been on the run, billions have flown.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, we refer to 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro which must build the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this amount will then allow the SGP to borrow on the markets a part of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Correctional Finance Act, considered by the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements to find the start of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the fee on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is said: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year."
The second is a reform of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernise it, to increase the product and to affect this increase in the Société du Grand Paris".
How much did that report?
Mystery.
This is not in the text.
We're far from the 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of capital resources that will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Grand Paris Society as a whole and as a measure of the project," we can read in the statement of reasons.
At the SGP, we can't find this shocking system.
"From the time of the creation of revenue (the two taxes, dnlr), studies can be covered over three years and then tap into the four billion after, we explain."
"This will be recorded in the budget and fired at random and measured."
The GSP believes that the 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This provision, in which the 4 billion promises are still to be made to the missing subscribers, could cause a somewhat agitated parliamentary debate.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avengers hackers and spies in diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals a apparent scandal, a scandal that only appears as a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and represents a future dominated by regression.
But procedures by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what could be read in any newspaper for months (except those that Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi's sadistic caricature profile has long been for sketch-related cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of known news is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every piece repeats (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And it's not only because the author of hidden texts doesn't like to do unpublished research (he doesn't know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who want to follow the occult believe only what they already know, and who confirms what they already learned.
It's Dan Brown's mechanism of success.
I'm going for the secret files.
The informant is biased, and biased (or limited-minded) the head of secret services (unless it could be, I know, editor in Liberia), who does not believe that what he recognizes is true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the Department of State was the same as Newsweek published the previous week.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of state can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have turned into espionage centers.
Any viewer of research films knows this very well, and it's only because of hypocrisy that we're making it look like we're ignoring it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and it serves to place American diplomacy under a bad light.
Second, the idea that a hacker can capture the most secret secrets in the most powerful country in the world is a non-neglectable blow to the prestige of the Department of State.
So the scandal doesn't make the victims as bad as the "bottles."
But let us come to the profound nature of what has happened.
So, in Orwell's time, we could design any power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely fulfilled since, in order to control each movement by telephone, each transaction carried out, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as is the case now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least hacker - elected as the revenger of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true that Georg Simmel already told him that a true secret is an empty secret (and the empty secret will never be revealed); it is also true that everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets meant to remove all power.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury caused by a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, the States will no longer be able to put any reserved information online - this would re-publish it on a display at the corner of the street.
But it is as obvious as with current technologies, it is worth expecting to be able to maintain confidential telephone reports.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I am well aware that, for the time being, my prediction is based on science-fiction and is therefore Roman, but I am forced to imagine government officials who are discreetly moving in diligence to uncontrollable routes, being only bearers of messages learned from the heart or, at the very least, by hiding the rare information written in the skill of a shoe.
The information will be kept in a single copy in key-closed drawers: in the background, the Watergate's spying attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I've had the opportunity to write that technology is now advanced in cancer, that is to say, rebounds.
A century after wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a telegraph on wire (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogic) had allowed cinema researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and backward and discovering all the secrets of the installation, while now the CDs (numerics) only allow you to skip chapter, i.e. macroports.
With the high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on a plane, and the movements it includes need three and a half hours.
It is therefore only extraordinary that communications policy and techniques return to riding cars.
One last observation.
At other times, the press tried to understand what was being done in the embassy's secret.
Now, these are the embassies asking for confidential information to the press.
Climate: how France boutuille its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the implementation of the fast-declared (fixed or early) financing promises made by developed countries.
And the great French boulevards are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU came out with the big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fixed-start funding: a report detailing the action of its Member States, a press conference, a big side event, a brochure distribution...
The transparency operation is appreciated and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces spending €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right track for compliance with its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in the detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen agreement, this money must be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without damaging public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what it means "new and additional".
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States which France has blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years to fixed-start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of the year or in terms of public development aid.
On the contrary, France believes that the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous years or to the overall level of public development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element, the distribution of gifts and loans.
There still, there is no rule and each chooses his calculation mode.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ of loan is equal to 1€ given.
Obviously, this is hardly justified: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some profitable investments (often projects related to the slowdown of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is necessary to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... Moreover, it should not be counted as the cost of the loan for the borrower country (that is the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has such a reasoning: it 'respects' its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to verify by yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use so massively the loan.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other words) comply with their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the very large majority of the European Union makes 1€ to meet its commitment, France only makes 10 cents and considers the effort comparable.
Nice pass-by tour!
In summary, in its fixed start-up financing, France is doing a double job: on the one hand, on the other hand, on the evolution of the action in time and on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it can be believed that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has done the arbitration) could have a double negative impact both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it was enough to lend) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not completely asymptomatic...
The chapter of early funding is only a relatively short-term issue compared to all climate discussions.
But it could be an extra sand grain in the immense machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that won't be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn lessons from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could move forward discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): the issue of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans will not be avoided.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Koscisko-Morizet, who will arrive at Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement on the permanent start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would be able to increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Alert to child-injurious pesticides
A 10-year-old child ingested 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published this Wednesday of the Association Generations Futures (ex-The Movement for Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which predicts that its results "have no significant statistical value in terms of the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with", bought between July and September the food consumed in four meals and one incas in one day by a child of ten years, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These types of meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been examined by laboratories for chemical, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The basis for the assessment is: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are classified as carcinogenic potential or likely and five listed carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrying," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three averies such as certain carcinogenics as well as close to twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, provided as an index by the study, contains traces of six chemicals, which are still banned by a fungicide in France.
Even for Kenya's green harecots, including in lunch, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the steak hooked, the boxed tuna, and even the bread bag and the chewing gum were hit by pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic seat used to heat the food in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminants cocktails" is "probably underestimated", according to the study.
The Alliance of Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), on the other hand, proposed a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "increased civilisation diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
