Tom reads to his daughter.
My computer is expensive.
The smoke came out.
Tom worked at the hospital.
I remember.
Continue reading:
Keep going.
Don't hesitate:
Sit tight.
Tom knows nothing about Mary.
Ask someone.
Look closer.
Hide.
We're the best.
Stop fighting.
It worked.
Don't make a noise.
Come on down.
Clearly, Tom is sad.
Tom ran away.
Tomorrow's gonna be hot.
Tom was inspired.
Let's go.
Tom doesn't want to see how he talks to you.
They all went out.
Oh, my God.
I don't think you lied to me.
I just want to have the ability to say that I'm sorry.
Be careful.
He's gone.
Drive harder.
I don't want to go to school.
Be good.
Hold it.
You're so sharp.
I'm ready to die.
Sit here.
How many years have you lived here?
Tom was dancing.
It doesn't matter.
They lied.
Tom's been flying.
My mother's at home.
Be careful.
Thank you.
Stay tight.
Take a step back.
Of course:
How beautiful it is!
You think I should do that?
Unbelievable!
No one knows.
Put your handcuffs on.
How's your number?
It was a good fire.
Tom didn't go into details.
Attention.
Please stop.
Tom was getting bored.
They laughed.
Keep this.
Tom took his breath.
They didn't know.
I can't stand to think about it.
Come on in time.
Are you going to go on vacation this year?
Come in.
A little bit to that side.
The airline only makes cargo transfers.
Tom's broken.
Where did you come from?
Tom told me he didn't learn French at the university.
Sit down.
Look here.
Get out of here.
Is there anyone in the house?
I'm sorry I'm so late.
I hit Tom's face with a gun.
I don't agree.
Keep dancing.
Don't look at Tommy.
Tom did it by hand.
All day long it takes me to sleep.
Find Tommy.
Tom Merry drove home with his car.
Women change the world.
A little high, please.
Tell him I'm asleep.
Tom married a girl from Boston.
They all laughed.
He's afraid of the darkness.
I'm not so sure yet.
Fill the milk with water.
I don't know if Tom's hungry or not.
Swallow it.
Someone's rare.
Finish.
It was uncertain.
Do what I asked.
It won't change anything.
I don't understand it at all.
Keep practicing.
Think about this.
What a shock.
Tom had to ask Mary for help.
Keep looking.
Keep going.
Can you tell me who's coming tonight?
Have fun.
Sit tight.
Be content.
I don't know why Tom didn't come, and I don't want to ask him.
I remember.
One read:
Be focused.
Charged:
Be careful.
Feel this.
It helps.
Wait here.
Please read.
I don't know if Tom's hungry or not.
I believe you will succeed.
Come to us.
One day you'll understand.
Look at it.
How interesting!
Stop, please.
Tom's reading what books?
I have two brothers and three sisters.
There are three places in this area.
Tom doesn't have time to talk to you right now.
Tomorrow Tom has to go to school.
Keep digging.
It's amazing.
Change your shoulders.
Hello, please.
He really speaks very well.
Nashti, please.
I looked around.
Take care of it.
You tried.
Keep fighting.
Did you hear me at all?
Eat slowly.
I'm not a doctor.
This is a bird.
We're together.
Take everything.
Let's go.
You did the experiment.
Let me.
It's on the table.
Tom's the head of his new car.
The contracts have already been negotiated.
Don't say anything.
Look under your eyes.
How can it be that you don't know?
Let me know.
What a surprise!
They're getting bored.
Keep working.
Tom was wandering.
I wanted to read that book all the time.
Me too.
They all laughed.
"Burghalif" is now the world's highest skyscrapers.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Forgive us.
It was amazing.
He walks.
Come back right away.
The tree swims.
Get out of here.
Cut it out.
Try again.
I'll give you five minutes to solve this problem.
What are you standing for?
Move a little bit:
I didn't even think you liked Tom.
When do you buy?
They won.
My mother's at home.
Tom died as a result of a stupid accident.
The circumstances have changed.
I gave up.
When do you buy?
Tom recovered.
How does this work?
Let's do it.
Stop the experiment.
Follow him.
Tom wrote this three weeks ago.
Be patient.
Let it go.
It doesn't matter.
I sat at home for a week.
I started living alone.
Take this.
Love me.
Are you kidding me?
Tom wondered if it was worth discussing with Mary.
Tom doesn't give a sign.
Be prepared.
Tomorrow will be hot.
Tom was laughing.
Time flies.
We've forgotten.
Now I need to see Tom.
Say "well."
They started a few hours ago.
Eat something.
He was weakened because of the loss of his blood.
Don't fight.
Be careful.
Try this.
Is there a man in the house?
Be reasonable.
Keep going.
Don't wait for us.
Translate the game.
Follow him.
I'm trying.
Tom needs something.
Change that.
When do you buy?
Come on.
Come on.
Sit down.
It's amazing.
Look again.
Who should give that?
Get up.
Stay there.
I talked to Tom tonight.
Keep trying.
Can you translate the noise?
Don't read.
They were swimming.
They called.
Tom doesn't pay attention to her dress.
That's what happens.
We were honest.
Tom and Mary walked in a crowd of mud.
It can't be late.
We were alive.
We work together.
Just sit tight.
Say, "Sight."
Let me do my job.
Forgive us.
Keep dancing.
Keep warm.
Think again.
We've forgotten.
We didn't get anything.
From the beginning, ladies.
I'm not a teacher.
Tom didn't say much, which is a bad sign.
One day you'll understand.
In those days, people lived there before.
Finish it.
Tom was in trouble.
Not at all!
It's going to move.
It's clear.
Say it.
Look around you.
Stop arguing.
Tom came to help us.
My eye was gone.
Take it.
Stop them.
Start again.
Keep walking.
Tom closed his eyes and looked like he was asleep.
Write this down.
Protect yourself.
I'm sorry enough.
Everything is important.
Be careful.
Wait a minute.
Don't wait for us.
That's what happens.
They all shouted.
Let's not talk long and go to work.
Tom smiled.
He cleaned the dust with a pig.
This morning the temperature fell below zero.
Did you think I forgot?
Be yourself.
Don't worry.
They waited.
Tell everyone.
Who do you want to ask?
What are you offering me to do?
I don't know.
We're learning on the basis of experience.
Tom Mary showed the paper.
Watch out.
They danced.
Start writing.
Hang on.
Now, put that down.
They walked.
Just tell me why you're here.
Look at that.
Tom stopped.
Cut the noise.
This is my choice.
Tom read French better than I do.
Show me.
Tom's mind is gone.
Take this.
Tom was fighting.
Tom agrees.
Watch carefully.
It'll be easy.
Oh, yes.
Tom's gone.
Did anyone get hurt?
Don't shoot.
Tom doesn't wear a sign.
Sing with me.
Ask Tom.
I'm saying.
No one answered.
Not bad.
Pindu, get some sleep.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Tom was never in my house.
Let's go.
That's enough of a lie.
You have the right to have your opinion.
It's very fun.
Be good.
Keep working.
Stop it.
Of course I can, even though I don't speak almost Shanghai.
I invested.
Let's find out how it's gonna help.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Be just.
When did you tell me?
Be reasonable.
Tom is a very self-consuming person.
Tom agreed.
We didn't get close.
There's a tall man in the audience.
I'll watch TV.
Wait for me next to the car.
Tom tried to speak French to the saleswoman.
Even if we get so late, it won't bother us.
Ask Tom.
Ask Tom.
What a horror!
Know that I'm in love with Mary.
I don't agree.
I want to make sure it's perfect.
Get in there.
Stay away.
Listen.
Does it look stupid?
Tell me.
What's your name?
We remember.
Running as fast as I could, I was able to catch my friend.
We're going to have fun.
Tom doesn't put it on the sign.
Stop.
I waited.
Something's changed.
Tom's on the run.
We waited.
Wow!
Everyone knew.
Sleep the pin.
This box contains 5 seeds.
I'm against it.
Tom asked us to be patient.
I didn't think he had the right to do that.
Tom smiled.
Don't pay attention to Tom.
It won't change anything.
No one's ever wanted to.
I have to do something about it.
Now, think about it.
Ignore them.
There was a shortage of workers.
Keep looking.
They were wandering.
Continue to weigh.
Can you speak French?
Look at us.
I can't stand it anymore.
Eat something.
Tom died three months before he graduated from high school.
Tom was born.
Tom and Mary ate in silence.
Welcome home.
Have a nice meal.
Join us.
Tom swims well than Mary.
Tequie right.
Be real.
Start again.
They all smiled.
I'd like to know how this happened.
Keep it.
Let's tell you why we're here.
Anyway, thank you.
Yeah.
Tom's with his mother.
Stay away.
They didn't know.
He was hurrying to go home.
Don't forget.
You can't do it without me.
Please go.
I deserve more.
Give it to me.
Keep going, please.
You were supposed to wait.
Let's get out of here.
It helps.
Now I have to see Tom.
Forget him.
It's a good time today.
Do you know the name of Tom?
Don't cry.
Please sing.
Let's do this.
I don't know if he's got there or not.
You're so sharp.
Tom found out.
No one came.
What are you standing for?
Wow, no.
Tom answered.
Here you go.
Tom called his neighbors.
And walk.
I'll see you at school.
Grab him.
Tom and Mary are alone in the room.
Love me.
Put this on.
Let's do the exercises.
Keep moving.
Hurry up.
Here you go.
Even green thoughts are infuriated.
Keep them.
I see.
Hurry up.
What are they waiting for?
Thank you.
What's the deal?
Go tomorrow.
Here you go.
Say, "Please."
There's a bad herd coming from that.
We're trying.
Tom can go to the club any minute to hear how Mary sings.
Tom liked Australia.
Take the tools.
The tree is green.
Don't worry.
Read this.
Be content.
It was uncertain.
It's going to stop.
Keep your mouth shut.
I think I left something in the audience.
One day you'll understand.
Do what I asked.
I'm scared.
It works.
Be careful.
Do you know the name of Tom?
Tom was crying.
Stay here.
The flowers bloom.
That's enough of a joke.
Get me the paper.
What happened?
The house is small.
Do you love your mother?
Come on in.
Tom wants a new car.
Other:
Someone got mixed up.
Mary cried.
Start singing.
Answer me.
It worked.
We forgot.
Wow, Sue.
Take a step back.
Sit down, please.
What's the difference?
A language is never difficult.
They've noticed.
Listen.
Tom came back to his room.
I don't think you lied to me.
Keep working.
There's no problem.
Finish this.
Tom was slow.
They play kids in an egg.
Think again.
When do you buy?
Let's do it.
There's no fixers on it.
Why are we running?
Put the bracelets on him.
They all smiled.
Let's talk about how this works.
Tom fought.
Dogs are screaming.
We talked.
It happened.
Sit here.
Stop.
Tom invited me to go with the movie star Mary.
Get ready.
Tell me what you're looking for, and I'll help you find it.
What?
Hello, Tom.
Be sure.
It's been years.
Get dressed.
Tom forgot.
I like it here.
If the alcohol is going to weaken my head, I'm going to drink a few beans instead of this terrible drug.
Tom really respects you.
I said some things I didn't want to say.
Look here.
Good world!
I've never eaten horse meat.
Let's not talk long and work.
Do you want to see what the new device is like?
We were saved.
A taco:
Squeeze.
They kissed.
Tom and I will go together.
Marry me.
You better go home as soon as you can.
They say Tom Jackson is one of Boston's best lawyers.
I'm sorry.
End game:
They approve.
It's just your opinion.
Fill the box with water.
You're the leader.
Tom begged us to be patient.
Whole food is important to healthy body, healthy consciousness, and the result is to have the highest efficiency.
Hurry up.
He believed the truth.
Tom looked at it.
Shampoo, please.
Stay here.
I don't live in detail.
Don't get up.
They all prayed.
They all started to laugh.
Tom was red.
No one asked.
Speed:
All right, Tom.
Please, please.
Be honest.
I'll see you at work.
Tell Tom.
Write it down.
Put this in.
I looked there.
Keep it.
I live in Ewa.
I'll be in the car.
Take these.
You're running.
Don't fight.
You don't do anything besides eating.
Don't do it, Tom.
Take care of them.
Don't look at them.
They were on their way.
She got married last year.
Tom made a link to my website from his blog.
Stand still.
Let go of everything.
This is my choice.
Tom's gone.
Let's tell you why we came.
You're running.
Well, that's another case.
Please sing.
Have you been here all night?
You'll do well to pull back.
It's time to go.
Toulouse:
I doubt that's what happened.
Tell me what I'm looking for, and I'll help you find it.
Stay away.
Keep them.
No one pays attention.
Stay away.
Come back.
Will you come over for a minute?
Sing with me.
Tom had often heard about Mary, but he had not met her yet.
Wait a minute.
Leave Tom.
Let Tomie.
Stop shooting.
Creatures don't have teeth.
He's gone missing.
Don't move.
Tom heard.
Tom wanted to sleep long, but he couldn't.
Expires On:
Start here.
That's funny enough.
Be kind.
Be prepared.
Tom was breathing.
Tom walked in.
How many years have you lived here?
Does it look animast?
Can you speak French?
Keep warm.
I thought Mary still loved me.
Stay here.
It's really impressive.
I don't know.
Mary ran.
Try again.
I slept a lot.
I get it.
Forget Tom.
Thank you.
Take him.
Sit down.
Don't yell.
Start writing.
Every man's work, whether it's literature, music, painting, architecture or anything else, is always his face.
A noise.
Everything's changed.
Ask Alex.
There are always options.
You were supposed to be waiting.
Let's do this.
I'm out of work.
What are you trying to do?
Stay here.
It helped.
Where did you come from?
Keep digging.
I missed you.
It's enough to argue.
I got it wrong.
Twist.
Tom can go to the band to listen to Mary at any time.
It's cold.
Stop it.
We don't need Tom.
I finished my homework when you called me.
Do you have plans for tonight?
I'm not tired.
Keep going.
How amazing!
Prepare:
Tom's gone wrong.
What's your favorite bird?
Tom is a very beautiful man.
Call us.
What about going to the movie?
Remember that.
These things are not mine.
We're lost.
Take me.
Call me.
He was screaming.
That's interesting.
Who died?
Stay here.
It's easy to say, but it's not easy to do.
Don't look at Tom.
Come on.
Long-term food:
I'll try again.
Tom's gone.
We forgot.
Tom should thank me.
I'll be right back.
You're driving.
Hurry up, please.
Be kind.
A broccoli.
Be patient.
Everyone was alive.
Speak clearly.
He tried.
Gather yourself together.
Speak clearly.
It's a phone call.
Who knows?
Sit here.
Most of all, I love seeds.
I'm working on it.
Do you have a more detailed map?
I got a message from Tom.
Tom looked into Mary's eyes.
Tom paid.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
The bread is fresh.
I want Tom to be killed.
Tom died.
Please specify the conditions for your use of this information.
Be reasonable.
After you.
I just ignore them.
What does Tom read?
Look at this first.
Stop right there.
I can do the math.
Don't worry.
Protect yourselves.
You've had patience.
Everyone's dreaming.
Thank you.
Tom's gone to the hospital.
Keep talking.
I forgot.
Forgive me.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Take care of this.
Go a little further.
Finish this.
Open fire.
Is there any details about Ellie?
Tom is much stronger today.
Fire! Fire!
Excuse me, can I leave a message?
Take me.
Please, come and bring me.
It'll be wonderful.
I drink milk.
Squirrel.
It can't be late.
Keep reading.
Even if he doesn't come, we have to start.
Don't get up.
Tom was asleep.
Tom can't accept your gift.
First Tom hated Boston.
It's offensive.
Everything's changed.
Tom heard how they named him.
Stay away.
Tom is dead.
Let's resist.
Tom looked at his watch.
Speak loud.
Ask different people.
The wood is burning.
Let him go.
Tom doesn't have time to talk to you right now.
Be respectful.
Stop arguing.
I can't let you do this.
Please don't mention my name.
Gather yourselves together.
It's nice to see that girl.
You're doing something right now?
Seventy-eight years is the normal life span of a person.
Forgive me.
Call me.
Hurry home.
Sit down.
Stay awake.
Don't move.
Is there a man in the house?
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Use the warning tools.
Speak out loud.
Well, I'll see you.
Tell Tom.
Did I leave something open?
Tom knows.
The snow came.
You can't do it without me.
That's enough.
Tell everyone.
Speak clearly.
Answer me.
When did you tell me?
Would it be normal if I sat here?
Keep writing.
Tom seemed to think he was adorable.
I'm sorry.
Be careful.
Keep trying.
Come back soon.
I'm sorry.
The decision was made.
My knife is sharp.
I left Tom open.
I get it.
That's right.
I'm drinking tea too.
Tom stood there waiting to cross the road.
I just want to have a chance to apologize.
Don't worry about it.
I don't remember what I ate last night.
Take care of it.
Ask Tom about it.
Do you think I should do that?
Tom ran away.
Cease fire.
They submitted.
Tom boasts of his new car.
Change your shoulders.
Time ran out.
Tom would like to go to Mary's night. Unfortunately, he had other things to do.
Take these.
Keep smiling.
I can always sleep wherever I am.
How deep?
Start now.
Tom laughed.
Tom smiled.
I woke up.
Let him go.
Let's get a little closer.
Leave it open.
I'm sorry enough.
Do we have one?
Don't push it.
Tom came out.
Tom won.
Tom's gone.
It's gonna be all right.
We hope to arrive in time.
Tom advised Mary to go as soon as possible.
Be focused.
Tom will die again.
Keep fighting.
Say it.
Remember that.
Listen carefully.
He helped.
You're a lot of talk.
Don't go in.
Take it.
Tom worked at the hospital.
Tom wrote a very detailed report.
These details will not be published.
They were all amazed.
Welcome to Wikipedia
Does anyone know whether the dining room is open or not?
The woman's in the room.
Take him.
Tom's trying to make a lot of money.
Keep running.
He wants to drink a little hot milk.
Wait, please.
Help me.
You're doing something right now?
What?
I like to be sad, and I know that most people are trying to avoid any kind of sad feeling, but I think it's wrong.
Round:
I have to translate the sentences.
How disastrous!
Everyone was waiting.
What a strange thing.
A broccoli.
Keep your eyes on it.
A dissatisfaction about the details.
It worked.
Be creative.
Choose carefully.
Stay still.
What a coincidence!
I confessed.
You have to sign this.
Be careful.
First year:
I don't care what you do with it.
Just think about it a little bit.
Why didn't you write me?
Listen.
They all panicked.
Get out of here.
Tom has a very creative spirit.
Stop.
Do you have an object on this plan?
Ask different people.
Tom failed.
Hello, Tom.
I'm sorry.
Be a soldier.
I didn't even think you liked Tom.
I love you.
You're yourself.
I'm going to have to have that cupcake.
I'm sorry.
Do well to pull back.
They cried.
Let's take a picture of my mother.
Hurry up, please.
I have two cats.
Don't say anything.
Please, stop.
What a tragedy!
We'll spend a good time in Boston.
I lost.
He was running.
We understand.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Be careful.
Don't shout.
Smile at me.
No one died.
Tom helped.
Take this.
Grab him.
Italo Calvino returned to Italy while he was still a child.
What are you proposing me to do?
Get in touch with Tom.
Start.
Don't shout.
What's the end of it?
Do you speak French?
Let him go.
Sign here.
Have you ever been to America?
Wait a minute.
Tom flew up.
Be careful.
Don't go after dark.
Tom volunteered.
Why did you stop me?
It's an old name.
I know.
Don't shout.
I don't know anything about this.
I'm late.
Thank you.
He's speeding.
Follow me.
Good evening.
What's wrong with me?
Stop.
Oh, my God.
Put this up.
Tom said it would take a few minutes.
None of my friends drink coffee.
Stand still.
Don't worry.
I don't have time to talk to you anymore.
I can't think about what happened.
Eat:
Tom wept.
Stop talking.
Tom blew up.
Don't worry.
You don't know it anymore.
Let's go.
Chris is very attractive and rich, but not very modest.
Good dreams!
Choose carefully.
What's convenient?
Don't say anything.
Pae!
He worked.
Tom's drinking.
My mother was upset.
How old is your dog?
Tom was saved.
I love the Aquitaine language.
Tom's in a hurry.
Stop arguing.
Let's move a little bit.
Do you have a dictionary?
Let's go.
They cried.
There you go.
Google Translate cannot translate expressions or define individual words.
Keep going.
Help me.
What's your favorite bird?
We wrote voluntarily.
Take Tommy.
Do it.
They're gone.
Grab him.
Tom wrote this three weeks ago.
It struck him very strongly, and for some time he didn't want to talk about anything, and I think it would take a long time for him to get back into a violent state.
Stay tight.
I don't speak Japanese.
Tom doesn't know what he wants to say in English.
Be respectful.
Tom says there's no problem.
Mr. Yoshida has a very good head out of France's history.
Good year!
Follow Tommy.
Stop complaining.
Take it.
Good.
Can you translate the noise?
You're working on Danda.
We know all the details.
Keep writing.
One concern:
Come on.
I'm doing my lessons.
Stop laughing.
I don't imagine life like that.
Get out.
Thank you all for coming.
Tom was listening.
Write me.
Did you hear me?
He was working.
We're going to have fun.
Follow me.
I don't know the details.
Take Tom.
Tom smiled.
It happened.
Don't shoot.
Keep moving.
Tom called.
They were burned.
Let us go.
Get up.
Nobody's listening.
Tom's driving a car.
They understood.
Take this.
Thank you.
What?
Don't worry.
It doesn't matter how much it's worth, I'll buy it anyway.
Everything changes.
Watch out.
Take this.
We know.
I couldn't understand his thoughts.
Heroes are called.
They're cheating.
It's not easy.
Home phone call.
They rested.
Where did you send the kids?
Hide.
Have fun.
Tom's poisoned to Mary.
We slept.
With us.
Come in.
It's my greatest happiness to read.
It's a bad herd.
Do you like it?
Tom's not a fool.
Let's talk about how this works.
Tom wasn't happy to see that Mary.
I also drink tea.
Try again.
I agree.
Keep going, please.
Please, listen.
I gave the music.
Get up.
This works.
How many of you are there?
Look closer.
Tom needs to know what's going on.
She's happy here.
The man sitting there is a famous singer.
Call us.
I can't make a proposal at all.
I find it very easy to talk to Tom.
Someone called.
Everything's broken.
It's a horse.
I know Jimmy from childhood.
You have to sign this.
I thought he was coming.
Tom cheated.
He came.
He's coming.
Who are we going to give this to?
Watch out.
Tom said he'd help me.
Stop complaining.
I swore.
Switch to the left.
Come on.
There's another one.
