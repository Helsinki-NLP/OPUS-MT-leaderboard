The members of the Walloon National Assembly are afraid to be called muppets.
Among some members of the National Assembly there was a conflict, which is the effect of the proposal to change their title to the members of the Walloon Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, in short MWP).
The idea was created in connection with the plans to change the assembly to the Walloon Parliament.
The members of the meetings on all sides of the political scene are concerned that they can become the subject of the kpin.
One of the MPs from the Labour Party expressed concern about their group, saying that the new name is intertwined with the Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh the word "twp" means stupid, and the word "pwp" means departures.
One of Plaid Cimru's policies stated that his group was "unsatisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
The Welsh Conservative Party member said that his party was "open" to change his name. However, he noted that the word "MWP" is very close to the word "muppet".
In this case, the wave letter "w" is similar to the letter "u" in the English dialect of Yorkshire.
As part of the Committee's meeting, which is currently working on a draft Act amending the name, the following position was taken: "The final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will naturally be theirs."
The Law of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal.
In addition, the Commission supported the proposal to change the title of the members of the assembly to "Member of the Walloon Parliament", that is, WMP in English, although this short "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity in society.
The members of the assembly are proposing alternative solutions, and the difficulties with reaching consensus are a challenge for Elin Jones, the chairman of the assembly, who should present the bill in the next few weeks.
The Act introducing reforms will also take into account other changes in the way in which the assembly works, including the rules on the removal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title when discussing the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
In the coming week, the voters will decide whether their country will bear the name of the Republic of North Macedonia soon.
The general vote is intended to help bring about a lasting dispute with neighboring Greece, in which there is a region called Macedonia.
The Athens Government has long claimed that their northern neighbour's name is a territorial claim and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Mr Ivanov, President of Macedonia, and the opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said that he would welcome the results of the vote.
However, the plebiscite voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the amendment is necessary to enable the State to join the European Union and NATO.
Call at the New York Church of St. Martin's Milk in connection with the problems of the church in Harlem
"The older people I talk to say that there was a bar and church in every corner in the past," said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's no trace of them at all."
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are currently sharing in a different way," he observed.
"The Bars have ceased to be the place of regular meetings of members of the community."
In the case of churches, however, he is concerned that the means of sale of the property are not sufficient for the time being as determined by the decision-makers, and that “they are at the point of exit sooner or later”.
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartments inhabited by people who would not support other surrounding churches.
As he said: “The overwhelming majority of those who buy houses in such buildings will be the white race. This will speed up the total closure of churches, because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by the assembly of white believers, before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the church of St. Marcina joined the community decades later).
The initial White Methodists' meeting left the division in the thirty years of the last century.
At that time, an African-American meeting took over ownership of the building.
The church of St. Marcina was taken over by a meeting under the leadership of the great John Howard Johnson, who led a fight against the 125th street vendors (the main trade street in Harlemia), opposing the employment or advancement of the African Americans.
The fire of 1939 damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson’s paraffination made plans to rebuild the temple and to repair the building of the bells.
Great David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's church, proudly called the new carylon "the poor".
The expert who called in July described them in a different way, such as "cultural treasure" and "unsubstituted historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first carylon in the world to be served by black music. The artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the Church of Riverside Church, where he was waiting for a larger team.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Marcina's church didn't replace him.
During the last months of St. Marcina’s church, a number of complicated events took place with the participation of architects and performers.
In July, the Parafial Council (the parafia governing body made up of the secular leaders) addressed its concerns to the tenets, stating that "it wants to put costs to the council", although the Council did not participate in the recruitment of the architects and performers who were sent to the scene.
Part of the paragraph also complains of lack of transparency on the side of the decade.
Rekin injured 13-year-old diving in search of lobsters in California
The authorities found that last Saturday the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California. It happened on the first day of the season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard a call for help. Immediately with a group of friends rushed into the boy to help him get out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first he felt that the boy was excited about catching the lobster, but soon he realized that the child was shouting: “I’m being bitten!
I've been bitten!".
After arriving at the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had a completely separated skin around both sides.
"I started screaming to everyone to escape the water: "In the water is the shark!" said Hammel.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to the Children's Hospital of the Children's Council in San Diego. His condition was defined as critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During the press conference, Captain Larry Giles said that fish had been observed a few weeks earlier. However, it was recognized that it was not a species of endangered sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper body.
In order to carry out the investigation and for safety reasons, the authorities closed the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca for 48 hours, until after Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noticed that the area is home to over 135 species of sharks, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's network plans to expand its activities in the British cosmetic market
The Sainsbury's network throws handcuffs to shops such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing cosmetic parts of the style of the goods houses in its supermarkets, as well as specially trained salesmen.
As part of a significant investment in the British cosmetic market, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and is constantly developing despite the fall in the fashion industry and household goods, there will be more regulation with cosmetic products in 11 stores. If the initiative is successful next year, it will be extended to other points.
The return to the cosmetic industry results from the search for ways to manage the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household articles.
According to Sainsbury's network doubles the number of cosmetic products and will offer even 3,000 items. In the assortment for the first time, goods such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw will appear.
Currently sold L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more places and separate areas close to those well known even from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to renew its offer of products to make Boutique. From now on, most articles will be friendly to ghettos, which are increasingly required by young customers.
In addition, the Perfume Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, and the second creation in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, later in the year.
The frequency of online sales and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local stores makes supermarkets have to encourage more visitors.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury's, said that sales points would be more and more reminded of the goods houses, because the network is trying to fight discounts, such as Aldi or Lidl, offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos network points in hundreds of shops and has introduced a number of Habitat networks since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increasing sales of food items and increasing investment profitability.
The previous attempt to reorganize parts with cosmetics and pharmaceuticals ended with failure.
At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots. However, the cooperation ended as a result of a conflict to share revenues from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's introduces a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies of Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to Lloyds, it will contribute to the implementation of the plan by introducing an extended offer of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four network stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and character of cosmetics to improve customer impressions.
We have invested in special training for collaborators to help consumers during purchases.
Our brands are able to satisfy all needs, and friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to pay attention to customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the way in which to make purchases."
Peter Jones "excited" after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the 11 million-pound contract
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Dan TV program, was "exciting" when he found out that Holly Willoughby was going to withdraw from worth 11 million pounds of lifestyle brand to focus on a new collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household articles called Truly.
The activity was not uniformly compared to the Goop brand belonging to Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, 37-year-old presenter announced her departure through Instagram service.
The sudden decision to leave a well-professed lifestyle brand and focus on the new collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV taken by Holly Willoughby inspired Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den.
According to sources, Peter Jones was "suffering" when a popular TV show announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds, he would not have time to dedicate his brand to offering the accessories and articles of the Truly household.
The company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand. She was also supposed to double Holly Willoughby's property estimated at 11 million pounds.
After announcing the decision to leave Truly's brand by the 37-year-old Holly Willoughby in Instagram, Peter Jones left Britain, returning to one of his summer houses.
According to the source, “Truly’s brand was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She tied her future with her and wanted to take care of her for decades to come.
The decision to withdraw completely surprised all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday.
In Marlow's warehouse, the goods are ready for sale."
The experts believe that the resignation of this Morning and one of the biggest success stars in the UK can cost the company millions of pounds in view of significant investments in products – including items from candles through clothing and household goods – as well as further delays in entry into the market.
It can also mean the end of a long - term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin for ten years maintained close relations with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Holly Willoughby together with Tara Capp set up a True brand in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March at the presidency.
The couple spent their vacation together, and Jones included 40% of the participation in the television production of Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is to become an M&S ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the I'm A Celebrity program at the ITV station.
A source near Peter Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business".
Hard conversation, “and then we fell in love with ourselves”
The president joked at the criticism of the media which he noted, which some considered to be "disobedient to the husband", as well as a positive relationship with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump surrender so much?
Trump said in a resounding voice, giving a TV presentation:
"I didn't give up anything."
The president noted that Kim Dzong Un was interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was called by Trump a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, nuclear disarmament negotiations are lagging behind.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the Chief of North Korean Diplomacy Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly Saturday that he did not see a "analogous response" from the United States to the early North Korea action aimed at disarmament.
He noted that, instead, the United States maintains sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We planned a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we're maintaining a great relationship."
The president said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Dzong Un have had a positive effect: they led to the completion of the missile tests, helped free hostages and returned to the rest of the American soldiers at home.
He also defended his unusual approach when talking to Kim Dzong Un.
"It's easy to behave after the presidency. However, instead of 10 thousand people waiting outside and trying to get to the crowded stadium, we would have 200 people here," Trump said, showing the thumb to the crowd gathered right in front of us.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have accidentally destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Despite the loss of roof over the head by more than 10% of the Lombok population, the authorities did not announce a natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"In many cases the authorities have made it very clear that they do not require international support, so the situation is difficult," said Selina Sumbun.
Although Save the Children is preparing for a trip to the Indonesian city of Palu, there is no doubt that international staff will be able to operate on site.
Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Agency for Natural Disasters, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Pala, to see if aid from international organisations should be allowed.
In the face of constant shocks in Indonesia, the country remains totally unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although shelters have been built in the province of Aceh in case of tsunamis, they are rare in the case of the rest of the coast line.
A lack of oxygen warning against tsunamis in Paul – despite the warning – is likely to have an impact on the number of deaths.
Even under the most favourable conditions, travel between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Life spans make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on Lombok Island, will go with the help of the victims of earthquake to the city of Palu. However, reach the goal to take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has improved Indonesia's infrastructure at the main point of his campaign and has allocated a lot of funds on the roads and railway lines.
However, in the face of future elections, the President's administration is struggling with the lack of funds.
In addition, Joko Widodo was placed under the emphasis on the country of religious tensions. Members of the majority of the Muslim community accepted a more conservative form of faith.
Over a thousand people died, and tens of thousands of people lost their heads as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using swords, bows, arrows, and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge gets a kick in the Chelsea game
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing Chelsea in the English Premier League, winning a gate in the 89th minute of the Saturday game played at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received treatment from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea gate at 1:0 for the disadvantage of his team.
Before giving a shot in the direction of the remote gate, he put the ball on his left foot.
The ball speeded high above the criminal field towards the top right corner of the net.
Then she entered the gate and flew over the throwing Kep Arrizabalag.
"I just tried to take the position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri always try to take it forward as the most. I wanted to give myself the best shot," Sturridge said in an interview for LiverpoolFC.com service.
"I noticed the approaching Kante, I took the ball and gave the shot without any deeper thought."
Chelsea led 1:0 in half of the match after the Belgian star Eden Hazard shot in 25 minutes.
The blue predator dug a ball five to Mateo Kovaccia and then ran toward Liverpool.
The cook quickly accepted the injection in the middle of the bowl.
He then performed a beautiful performance forward in the field of crime and returned to Hazard.
Hazard was ahead of the defenders, and he turned his left foot toward a long column of arrows that passed through Liverpool's gatekeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet with the Naples Club in the group league of Masters on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet with Videoton in the UEFA People's Europe on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of Tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832 people
As the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disasters reported on Sunday morning, the number of recent victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in the country increased to 832 people.
During the conference, the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho informed that as a result of a Friday earthquake of 7.5 degrees in Richter's scale, many people were imprisoned under the debris.
Located by more than 380 thousand people, the city of Palu is full of rubble of fenced buildings.

Cromwell's memory before the British Parliament's last victim in the dispute of "writing history again"
The removal of the memory would bring justice to the Taliban's warning of the destruction of many English cultural and religious remains by its radical, Puritan supporters.
However, Cromwell Society's association described Jeremy Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and a "try to write history again".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Since the current debate on the removal of monuments is ongoing, the issue of the status of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
In the course of the English domestic wars, the actions were neither commanded nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps his predecessor Thomas was determined to punish this Cromwell for his actions a century earlier.
The way in which Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell on the memory shows how happy he was to have this policy in the 19th century and that for many people he is a figure that is still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: “Through many people, Cromwell was seen – perhaps more often in the 19th century than at present – as a defender of parliament against external pressure.
The assessment of the appropriateness of this statement is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the 17th century formed the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as the Lord of the Protector also deserve to be taught and remembered."
In China, there has been a death tortoise the farmer through the pig
As local media say, the trade in south-west China has led to a deadly attack of pigs on the farmer.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and with a broken artery near the mall in the town of Liupanshui, in the province of Kuijču.
The pig breeder prepares for vaccinations in Chlevni, 30 May 2005, Xining, in Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, a man came to the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the priest found the man's body and noticed the door open to the nearby nail.
He said there was a great request for blood in the bowl.
The body section confirmed that it was about 250 kilograms of pig fatally disturbed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and rediscovered," said a man named Wu quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The materials from the surveillance camera show that Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The trade manager said in an interview with the Guiyang Evening News service that at the time the evidence was collected by the police, the request was withdrawn to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the male family and the trade authorities negotiate compensation for death.
The cases of swine attacks on humans have already been recorded, although they are rare.
In 2016, the pig attacked the woman and her husband at the farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, about 300-kilograms of pigs enslaved the farmer to the tractor, and the man's wife managed to pull the animal.
After eating a pig farmer from Oregon in 2012 one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can lead to brutal behaviour in them.
"They just want to have fun.
They're so interested in nothing... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them proper respect," he said.
Residues following the hurricane of Rosa cause heavy rainfalls in the south-west part of the United States
According to the forecasts of Hurricane Rosa, it loses its power, moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, heavy rain falls in northern Mexico and south-west parts of the United States.
Huragan Rosa knows at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 am east time, he was assigned category 1. He was then located 620 km south west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
As predicted on Sunday, Rosa will move north.
In the meantime, over the Pacific Ocean, it begins to form as a heading east toward the western coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving the masses of wet air north, to the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, he will bring down to 25 cm in parts of the territory of Mexico.
In the next few days, wet tropical air coming into contact with the approaching below causes rainfalls in the South West of the United States.
In some places a fall of 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden flooding, pollution shifts and possible droughts in desert areas.
Wild tropical air causes falls anywhere from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour. This is particularly true in the Nevada and Arizona areas.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the South West USA, especially above most of Arizona.
In view of the widespread nature of tropical falls, sudden flooding and violent changes in conditions may be possible.
In view of the threat of tropical rain, it is decided to take a walk through the desert.
The slopes can change the canyons into a flowing river, and storms with piorunas cause local winds and dust shifts.
Next to bring local rainfalls on the southern coast of California.
Rains of a total height of more than 1,3 cm may cause small movements of pollutants and road hazards.
It would be the first fall of this rainy season in the region.
The rains of tropical rains will begin to reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and Tuesday, there will be a larger number of areas.
On Tuesday, the rains reach the Four Corners region in the western part of the United States and last until Wednesday.
In October, together with cooling in the Arctic region, temperatures may fluctuate throughout the United States. However, in the inter-versal area there will be more heat.
It can lead to violent temperature changes in small distances.
A good example is the weekly temperature differences in the central part of the States.
Between Kansas City (stan Missouri) and Omaha (stan Nebraska) and between St. Louis (stan Missouri) and Des Moines (stan Iowa) these differences are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, annual temperatures may increase again.
In much of the central and eastern parts of the United States, temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to the northern part of the East.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature can reach 27 degrees Celsius, about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term weather forecasts indicate a high probability of rising temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Bretta Kavanaugh's hearings
More than 20 million people watched in six television stations triggering Thursday's hearing of the judge of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impact on Friday, the commentators had to interrupt regular programmes to inform about the sudden return: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation into the allegations.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Commission that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had spotted her in a state of neutrality and tried to take off her clothes during a high-end party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said he was convinced that there was no such thing.
It is possible that the Friday number of TVs was even greater than that given by Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company accounted for the average number of TV stations CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, no figures have yet been available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty in measuring the visibility of people at work.
The given number is close to the visibility of U.S. Cup games or the award of the American Film Academy.
According to Nielsen Station Fox News Channel, whose presenters firmly supported the Kavanaugh nomination, she had the highest visibility. She made an average of 5.69 million views during the daily interview.
The second location is ABC station of 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million views, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake became a key figure in Friday's events.
In the early hours, he was arrested by the CNN and CBS station cameras after the office of this moderate republican issued a statement that he had decided to support the appointment of Kavanaugh.
Flake with his head released for a few minutes listened to the unmistakable opinions, and the whole event was transmitted by the CNN station.
"I'm standing here in front of you and I'm asking.
Do you think he's telling the national truth?
You have the power in the face of poverty of so many women," he heard from a demonstration woman.
Before closing the window, Jeff Flake said that his office had issued an appropriate statement and that he would speak at the hearing of the Commission.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast events in anticipation of a vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh before the whole Senate.
Flake said that he would nominate only when he knew that the FBI was investigating the charges in the coming week, which the minority of the Democrats were charged with.
Flake was convinced by a part of the conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after meeting with Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election was important because the Republic would not have the votes necessary to approve the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh without a trace.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges brought against Bretta Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses criticism of using Brexit for its own benefit
In a weekly briefing, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the European Union of criticizing its abandonment plan for the future of Britain and national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May attends a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In addition to the statement presented by Theresa May on the title page, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, in her Government, Boris Johnson, attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union following Brexit, according to which the United Kingdom and the EU would be able to collect taxes on its behalf, calling it "totally undesirable".
Shooting Wayde's Sims: Police arrested Ditheon Simpson suspected of murdering LSU
Police arrested a suspect in connection with the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in the colours of the State of Louisiana (LSU).
According to a police commander in Baton Rouge, a 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson was arrested and put in custody on the charge of second-degree murder.
The authorities published a video from the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
As reported by the CBS station WAFB police officers found the above-mentioned eyeglasses on the site and found traces of Simpson DNA on them.
The police informed Simpson that he had admitted to shooting Wayde.
As the lawyer handed over to the detainee, the bail amount was set at $350 thousand.
On Friday, the Coroner's office in East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report that claimed that the death was a head and neck injury.
The police command expressed gratitude to the research team of the state police in Louisiana, the crime lab of the state police, the South University police and the nearby residents for the assistance they received in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of LSU sports, thanked the local authorities for their "working and striving for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The man who was measuring 198 cm grew up in Baton Rouge. His father Wayne Sims also played a basketball in LSU.
In his last season, he scored an average level of 5.6 points and 2.6 collections per match.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach said the team was "stirred" and "strung" by Wade's death.
"It's one of the things we're constantly worried about," said Will Wade.
Ash emitted by the volcano reaches Mexico City
The ashes coming from the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern parts of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the National Center for the Prevention of Natural Disasters gave Mexican residents the opportunity to get closer to the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and dust emissions within 24 hours.
The Centre has noted numerous shocks and shocks.
Published in social media photos show the front tracks of cars covered with a thick ash layer in Mexico’s districts, such as Xochimilco.
Since the earthquake of 7,1 degrees, which Mexico visited in September 2017, geophysics have recorded an increase of 72 km south-east of the country's capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has remained active since 1994.
Police senior with Catalan separatists prior to the year's referendum on independence
On Saturday in Barcelona, six people were arrested as a result of senior protesters supporting Catalonia's independence with preventive police forces. On that day, thousands took part in the enemy demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of an exciting referendum on Catalonia's session.
The group of masked separation propellers threw eggs and paint powder from police officers. The dark clouds of dust poured down the streets usually full of tourists.
It also got to maturity later in the day. To stop the police force fighting, they used a stick.
For a few hours, the groups that support independence scandalized "We don't forget, we don't forgive".
As the local press reports, fourteen people received medical assistance due to minor injuries reported during the protests.
After the year since the referendum of 1 October the tension is not weak. Although the authorities in Madrid have considered it illegal, there is still reason to celebrate the desired sessions of the Catalans.
The majority voted for independence, but the frequency was low in view of the large number of opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people suffered injuries last year in brutal elders with police trying to prevent voting in polling stations.
On Friday evening, a group of supporters of the independence of the region decided to prevent demonstrations by supporting police officers.
The demonstration took place despite this, but a change in route was forced.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician participating with a wife in the separatist protest, said that there is no longer any hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we survived one of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents cried out with joy that they could vote, but now we are stuck in the point without leaving," he said.
In spite of the important and small victories in local elections in December last year, the parties supporting the secession of Catalonia have difficulty continuing their activities. Many of the most well-known leaders have decided to leave or expect to be arrested in the process because of the role played in the referendum and the subsequent announcement of independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old protest-supporting mechanic, said that politicians on both sides of the dispute are fueling conflict.
"The situation is becoming increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced his wish to start the European Parliament's next year's elections.
"Evaluation in elections to the European Parliament is the best way to defuse the crisis of the democratic values of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested as a result of several car hits in Londonderry’s home.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 7:30 p.m. in British time (BST).
Commissioner Bob Blemmings said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At a certain point in the direction of the car, a shot from the body could also be fired.
The Mengi Gate ensures that Livingstone wins over Rangers 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Mengi for Livingstone brought the team victory
From this season on, Livingston Club Extraclass played Rangers in a lockdown, giving Steven Gerrard a second defeat in his 18 matches at the Ibrox Park Club Coach's station.
The Dolly Mengi Gate proved victorious, and Gary Holt's team moved to the second place in a table with Hibernate.
The team under Gerrard will remain in this season without winning the trip to the Premiership. Next Sunday, the team will meet with the Hearts leader, to whom he loses eight points.
Earlier, because on Thursday, Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA League of Europe.
Livingston is extending a series of victories in his division to six matches. Coach Holt has not experienced any defeat since his replacement in the last month of Kenny Miller.
Livingston missed several occasions against undisposed opponents
The team led by Holta should have covered driving much earlier, as the team's game contributed to many problems.
First Scott Robinson went through the defense and gave him a shot in the light of the gate, but he couldn't shoot himself naked. Then Alan Lithgow didn't hit the head of Craig Halkett.
The owners allowed Rangsom to play closer to the gate, knowing that they could threaten rivals during the constant pieces of the game.
And that's how she got the trigger.
After the Rangers dropped off the Livingston Free Team, they found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created the situation of Mendze, who got naked from within the criminal field.
At this stage, Rangers had more possessions, but they could not force the defenses of the economy and did not raise problems for Liam Kelly.
The schemat was repeated in the second half, and Alfredo Morelos gave one shot at Kelly's gate.
Scott Pittman's sample was defended by the Rangers of Allan McGregor, and Lithuania was unable to get into the light of the gate from the next permanent fragment that was charged to Livingstone.
The Rangers continued their attacks in the Livingstone prison field, but they could not take advantage of the situation. Two sentences were demanded after Halket's intervention against the Glenn Middleton switch and one hand-playing. However, in both cases the contenders' claims were rejected.
"The Phenomenal" presentation of Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingstone.
In his view, they played a great game, again and again, going beyond expectations.
Their style and composition almost did not change from returning to extraclass. However, Holta should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
The match had a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a well-organized defense. Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall very careful throughout the match.
There's no such thing as a fight.
Although Gerrard's leadership has been at great moments, they have failed to meet their standards.
There seemed to be something missing in their game: it only happened once through the defense of the host. This should be a serious warning to the Rangers who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Colonia
During Saturday's breakfast in Berlin (29 September) Turkish and German leaders accompanied smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of the upcoming controversy of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, with the aim of improving the relationship between NATO allies.
Disputes have led to differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After meeting Erdogan, he went to the Colony, where he opened a new, huge match.
In this city, the largest number of Turks live outside their homeland.
According to the police, for security reasons, a 25-year-old crowd gathered in front of the temple was blocked. However, the president's supporters gathered around to see their leader.
Erdogan’s opponents, including many Kurds, also decided to express their opinion by condoning the Turkish leader’s policy and the German government’s decision to adopt the country’s policy.
On the contrary, the protests reflect the divisions which sparked the visit of a politician called by a part of the Turks living in Germany and recognized by others as a autocrat.

In October last year, prevention units were called to the plant because of dangerous interferences in which workers were attacked by ballads.
The sudden flooding caused by the Rosa hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial effects on areas covered by drought)
It is rare that tropical depression will reach Arizona. It is likely that it will come at the beginning of next week. The rest after the hurricane of Rosa move through the desert areas of the South West, threatening with sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of sudden hits on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, south and east Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to a forecast Tuesday, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix. On Monday afternoon rain will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a storm or tropical depression within 320 km of Phoenix.
Hurragan Katrina (in 1967) approached a distance of 65 km from Arizona's border."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict rainfall from 5 to 10 cm. In some areas Mogollon Rim in Arizona can reach a height of up to 15 cm.
In the other desert areas of the South West, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Cotline, the rainfall is likely to be from 2.5 to 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
In addition to areas threatened by sudden rainfall associated with Hurricane Rosa, people may be relieved because the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
Although the floods pose a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where the drought is taking place.
As the weather.com portal reports, U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that almost 40% of Arizona's area competes with the affected droughts of the second of the highest categories.
Hurragan Rosa first reaches the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa continued to move with hurricane force, reaching speeds up to 137 km/h. Currently it is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is heading north at 19 km/h.
Hurragan is pumping colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing its weakening.
According to the forecast, a tropical storm will strike in Mexico in the afternoon or in the evening.
Heavy rainfalls in some parts of Mexico may pose a major flood threat.
The Portal weather.com reported that “in the area from the California Peninsula to the north-western part of Sonora’s state, a decrease of 7 to 15 cm is expected, although they can reach 25 cm”.
Then the hurricane will cross through Mexico north in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early hours of the morning, it reaches the border of the state of Arizona as a tropical depression. By Tuesday evening it will reach the southern part of the state of Utah.
"The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remains is the very low rainfall in the California Peninsula, in the north-west part of the state of Sonora and in the south-west desert areas of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
According to the rain forecast, the life of sudden flooding and the movement of pollution in the desert and mud in the mountainous region is dangerous.

Trump found that Brett Kavanaugh "discovered the rage and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote given to Judge Kavanaugha is a vote against the unmistakable and repulsive proceedings of the Democratic Party," Trump said at the age of in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "saw the anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention, and he was constantly and emotionally opposed to the charges of Christina Blasey Ford. A woman claims that a few decades ago, when both were teenagers, a man allowed himself to be sexually assaulted against her.
Ford also testified during the hearing on the allegations it had made.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day "Americans could be convinced of the brightness, class and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The voice given to Judge Kavanaugha is the voice of the support of one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, a man of great rights for the community," he said before a crowd of voters in West Virginia.
The President did not refer merely to the appointment of Bretta Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of the Republicans' frequency in half of the elections.
"From the most important choices in our lives, we have been divided by five weeks.
I do not start in these elections, but I remain very active," he said.
"I keep fighting against our great candidates."
Trump argues that the Democrats are pursuing a policy of "resistance and impeding activities".
As the CNN station said one of the assistants of the important policy of the Republican Party, the first key Senate vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia. Number of victims increases
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people died – many of which were kidnapped by high tides breaking off the beach – as a result of the severe earthquake of the land and tsunamis that visited the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday in Pala, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in the festival town. On the beach, they hit waves reaching even 6 meters high, beating many people and ruining everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When there was a threat yesterday, people living on the beach did not run away immediately and fell victim to tsunamis," said at a conference in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesperson of the Indonesian agency for the disaster of BNPD.
"Tsunami attacked everything on its way, driving cars, colds and homes," Nugroho added. Then he added that before reaching the shoreline, the food moved to the sea at 800 km/h.
As he said, some of them were saving their lives by climbing a tree.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Pal.
Many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and damaged bridges and water-scattered towers are seen by the Agency for Natural Disasters.
On Saturday, the coastal city was visited by the shocks of the second.
A number of earthquakes have occurred in the area of 2.4 million people.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT), energy released by the extensive Friday earthquake was about twenty times higher than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration stated that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of the long, narrow bay, could have been affected by the tsunamis.
Sutopo Purvo Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said that the flood had taken hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels.
He then added that part of the victim's body was found under broken buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 people were considered missing.
Nugroho said that the deaths and injuries could be greater along the coast line 300 km north of Pal, in the area called Dongal, which was near the Earthquake Epicenter.
According to Nugro, the communication "has been totally paralysed", so there are no reports from the province of Dongal.
“There are more than 300 thousand people” – you can read in the Red Cross statement. It has also been added that workers and volunteer organizations appear at the scene affected by the disaster.
"Now we can talk about tragedy, although the situation may lead to a significant deterioration," said the statement.
On Saturday, the agency met with a general criticism of the lack of information on the impact of the tsunamis in Palu. However, the authorities indicated that the waves had come just after the warning was given.
On the amateur video released in social media, you see a man screaming from the building trying to warn about the coming tsunamis of people on the street.
Within a few minutes, the water wall broke down on the shore, destroying buildings and cars.
The Reuters agency was unable to confirm the authenticity of the recording immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused significant lack of electricity supply, preventing communication within the framework of the Pale, which has, in turn, hampered the coordination of rescue activities.
According to the military authorities, shipments of transport aircraft began with Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated persons still need food and other basic items of the first need.
The airport located in the city was opened only for humanitarian transport. The airport will remain inactive until October.

"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although some groups are slow to reach out to help, there have been criticisms that travel to Paul is not possible for foreign humanitarian workers with a rich experience.
Under Indonesian law, the adoption of funding, resources and foreign personnel can only begin after the disaster has been announced by the national disaster area.
It wasn't done right now.
"We are officially still dealing with a regional disaster," said the Indonesian speaker of the Red Cross.
"When the government acknowledges that a national disaster has occurred, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but this has not yet happened."
After two days of Friday’s earthquake and tsunamis in Paul’s home, friends and families of those who have been lost are still alive, I hope that their loved ones will find themselves somewhere in the midst of destruction.
A little boy was pulled out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, the lifeguards released a woman who spent two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian paramilitary representation, trained two missing paramilitaries participating in this month in the Asian Games in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandadi said, other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As an experienced paralytic, I am struggling with my own emotional burden," he announced.
Gendon Subandano told us that within a few hours of the arrival in the community, the co-pilots of information about Roa Roa desperacko's collapse sent messages by the WhatsApp communicator to athletes participating in the beach festival.
His messages were marked only by one grey hook instead of a pair of hooks in blue.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.

Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Raper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
Speaking of his intention in the Twitter service on Saturday, he wrote about himself: "A person known earlier as Kanye West".
Forty-one-year-old music has been using the pseudonym Ye since. It's also the title of his eight album released in June.
The change took place before a visit to Saturday Night Live. It is expected that during the artist's performance, he will present his new album pt. Yandhi.
It will replace the songwriter Ariana Grande, who, according to the authors, has given up "for emotional reasons".
The West has already stated that the word "Ye" is not only short of his present artistic experience, but it has religious significance.
“I think that “yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Scriptures it means “Ty”””” said West in a previous period of the year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter about the pseudonym Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's about us.
First, I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all our good, evil and evil traits.
The album shows who we are."
West was among the other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known under the pseudonyms of Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former collaborator West, also wrote his pseudonym in various ways, with a connector, without connector and large letters.
President Andrés Andrés Manuel López Obrador elects not to use military against civilians
In the early 50th anniversary of the blood pressure demonstration by the student president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) committed never to use military force against civilians.
On Saturday at the site of the Three Cultures López Obrador promised "never to use armies to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fires in the square towards a peaceful demonstration, killing even 300 people. It happened at a time when left-wing movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young people living in Mexico, providing monthly financial assistance for students, as well as creating more free public schools.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities for young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence research
As Kai-Fu Lee says, an investor and artificial intelligence expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, together with the increase in Chinese activity in this area in the United States, should double research expenditure in the area of SI.
It has to do with the announcements on artificial intelligence published by the various government agencies of the United States, although the United States does not have an official SI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan, according to which they wanted to become the most innovative country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"At first, we must double the budget for research on SI: all other countries are far away from the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area," Kai-Fu Lee said.
In an interview this week, the CNBC also said that double funding could double the chance of another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, president of Sinovation Ventures. The company has invested in one of China's most important arts companies, known as Face++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University on the creation of an SI system that won the best American player in the game Othello. He then took the lead in Microsoft Research and was president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognized the success of previous American government's technological initiatives, such as the Agency for Advanced Research Projects in the Defence Area (DARPA) competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked about the next edition of the competition because he thought it would help find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government grants.
"It is not China that we receive the best representatives of academic environments, but corporations," Lee said.
For a few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed excellent scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of SI.
"I think that people with artificial intelligence who have gained a doctor's degree should automatically grant a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council published a plan to create artificial intelligence for the next generation.
According to Lee, the Chinese National Foundation for Natural Science (National Natural Science Foundation of China) provides funding to members of academic institutions in a way close to the American National Foundation of Science and other government organizations that recognise American resources. However, the quality of academic activities in China is lower.
In the earlier period of this year, the United States Department of Defence called for a joint artificial intelligence centre to be involved in the work of partners from the world of industry and science. The White House announced the creation of a special commission for artificial intelligence (Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
This month, DARPA also informed about the target of $2 billion for the initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than USD 100 billion per year in research on SI.
At the same time, the American initiative aimed at establishing the National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence did not move forward from one month to another.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change in the name of their country
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in the referendum on the change of their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would allow the movement to welcome a decade-long dispute with Greece, which blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in the area where the historic region of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and has therefore called upon the country to join the EU and NATO.
In June, both governments reached agreement on the name of the country, but the nationalists say that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority in Macedonia.
President Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. The campaign encouraging the boycott raised doubts as to whether the frequency would reach the minimum level of 50% required for the referendum to be considered binding.
The referendum asked: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU after the adoption of an agreement with Greece?"
The name-changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is worth paying the price for Macedonia's accession – one of the countries that have fallen after the fall of Yugoslavia – to organisations such as the European Union or NATO.
"I have voted for the future of my country so that young Macedonians can live free under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will provide us with greater security," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that it respects the results of the vote.
The change of name requires the support of two thirds of Parliament members.
The National Electoral Commission has informed that no unusual events have been recorded by 13 p.m.
However, the frequency at this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016. At that time, 66% of the persons qualified were elected.
"I voted in favour of my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Tanewski, the Skopje electorate.
On 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister of Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duszko voted in a referendum on the change of country name to open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union.
Prior to the building of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkow prepared a small stage and set a chair for the rents distributed by the boycotting referendum.
"We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organisations with the head of the Union, not the back doors," Kawardarkow said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaew says that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments in Macedonia, with unemployment of more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority are going to change the name in the referendum, because 80% of the citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that voting on "yes" is "the confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Public Studies from 30 to 43% of voters declared their wish to participate in the referendum, which is less than the required frequency.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV Telma TV in Sunday's referendum, 57% of respondents are planning to vote.
70% of respondents found that they had changed their name.
In order for the vote to be successful, the frequency must be 50% + 1 vote.
The defeat in the referendum would be the first serious part of the Western government's policy since the government was held in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City defeats the entire Brighton defense and wins the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent Brighton's defense to the house at the weekend meeting ended with 2:0 for Manchester City. The match was played at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The door opened by Aguera in 65 minutes looked childish.
The action began in the middle of the box to the Argentine attacker.
The footballer raced three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was among the four Brighton winners.
First he beat one of them and then raced the others and found himself on the edge of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he played the ball to the left where he was waiting for Sterling.
The English assailant immediately gave the ball back to Aguery in the criminal field, who beat Brighton Mathew Ryan's butcher, shot at the right side of the gate.
"Aguero fights with the foot office," the journalist told Manchester City Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what happened.
We were lucky he got the gate at the time."
However, Sterling provided a blue first run single at the Premier League.
The door he's talking about fell in 29 minutes.
In the action of this Aguero, he got a ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a great gift along the left-hand side of the box to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move to a distant column.
The Manchester City attacker was sending a ball to the net just before she got out of the car.
Manchester City meets with Hoffenheim at the UEFA Masters League on Tuesday at 12:55. The meeting will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to destroy the chances of winning Rockies
After losing the chance to participate in the play-off phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer, he didn't have to take the first stage.
However, the fans of the Scherzer competition hope to take place in a Sunday meeting against Colorado Rockies, if only Rockies keep the chance for a play-off show. Currently the team has one win more than Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
Rockies can at least count on a wild card if they win a Friday meeting against the Nationals result 5:2. However, they still want to get their first title of the division master.
"Although we play "about nothing", at least we will go out to battle, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the presence of opponents will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why would I not want to take part in this meeting?"
Nationals have not yet announced the start-up speaker for Sunday's meeting. However, the team agrees to show Scherzer in the first composition.
This would be the thirty-fourth Scherzer performance in the first class. The racer took part in the Thursday throw training and hopes to take place on Sunday.
The team's true miner from Washington recorded the results 18-7 and ERA 2.53. 300-fold eliminated the balls and counted 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
More Trump in West Virginia
Trump did not refer simply to his appointment as Judge of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of Republicans' frequency in the case of half the presidential election.
"In November, we are making all the achievements we have achieved.
From one of the most important choices in our lives, we've been divided by five weeks.
Although I do not start, I remain very active. I constantly arm our great candidates," he said.
He went on to say: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions in our own eyes.
They're determined to take power by all possible means, they're dirty and they're mean.
They do not care for those who are injured or need to harm them in order to gain power and control. The goal of power and control is theirs, but We will not give them that which is theirs.
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out the mission of "resistance and hard work".
"It was very good to see this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "bad, evil, unpleasant, and unreal."
The president referred to the Senate Judicial Commission, calling on the name and name of the American senator of the Democratic Party of Diana Feinstein, which met with a loud noise from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the leaking of the document?
"Uh, do I hear that?
It was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant to those expressing their own opinions
When the members of the Momentum organization in my party voted in favour of my refusal, I was not surprised.
Finally, I am a member of the Group of Ambassadors of the Labour Party, which has recently been told that they are not welcome, and that is all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan met with similar treatment because she was opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the application for a bribe was based on a difference of opinion between me and Jeremy Corby.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. As ironically, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders in these matters.
In a Friday announcement on the meeting of the Labour Party parliamentarians from Nottingham East, it was possible to read: "We want the meetings to be open and productive".
For eight years, I have been performing the post of the Labour Party, most of the afternoon Friday meetings of the General Committee looked exactly like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are currently taking place differently, and the promises of a "more heartier and more relaxed" policy have long been forgotten, as long as they have been remembered.
It is increasingly evident that the Working Party does not tolerate different views. Each opinion is assessed in terms of compliance with the Party's management.
It all started shortly after Jeremy Corbyn's president's position was taken up. The colleagues, where I thought we had similar views, began to expect me to change my direction and take the positions I would not agree with earlier, and they were dealing with issues such as national security or the single EU market.
After every public appearance – no matter what the content of it is – I meet in social media with attacks calling for the reception of nominations, the contamination of the centre or the abandonment of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I'm happier than some of my colleagues because the attention I give to my address is rather political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience everyday sexist or racist treatment, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to the agenda with the insults of others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should support the culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer grouping people with different views, and with each application for "reliance vow" and any change in the rules of the party's choice of views, the party has to be suspended.
Over the last two years, I have been repeatedly suggested that I do not hesitate and beg for some questions.
But that's not why I'm doing politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student in the result of the neglect of the Margaret Thatcher government, which led to the breakdown of my school class, I try to ensure a better quality of public services for those in need – both local councillors and ministers.
I've never covered my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone around Nottingham East knew my position and knew about differences in opinion with the party authorities.
I would like to say to those who supported the fifth proposal that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the president of the labs in the face of the approaching Brexit, which would harm the domestic economy, businesses and public services.
However, the most important transmission I am sending not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my electors (both members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud that I can serve you. I promise that no threat to cancellation of the nominations or clear political objectives will discourage me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr versus Melrose 38:17 – Undeserved Ayr again up
Two late apps could have some way out of the final result. However, there is no doubt that Air team won this extremely interesting game of shock extraligi.
The team was first placed in the table and remains the only unresolved team.
In the end, this distinctive defence and better use of the opportunity led the host team to win. Coach Peter Murchie could be satisfied with his subcontractors.
"The matches have been a challenge to us so far, but we are still imperfect, so I am happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose team said: "It is necessary to respect Air fighters. They have made better use of the emerging opportunities."
Ayr went out to drive in the 14th minute after Grant Anderson and raised Frazier Clim. However, the yellow card for Rory Hughes, who came to the team from the Glasgow Warriors team, allowed Melrose to balance the result when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an unused chance to rise.
Climo increased the Ayr driving after the removal of the penalty drop just before finishing the first half. First he got the apparition, and then took the chance to raise, getting the result 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose had a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's application, raised by Baggot, reduced his loss to five points.
Then the game was further stopped because of the serious contusion of Ruaridh Knott. The winner was removed from the box on his nose. After the resume Ayr increased the driving after the application of Stafford McDowall and the rise of the Clima.
In a further sequence, the captain of the Air Blair Macpherson team received a yellow card. Melrose again used its number: applying with an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced driving.
The owners took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to hit Clim without a ball.
Climo took the chance to raise, and then he managed to get the result back just after the game was over, when Kyle Rowe caught a shot from the prison throw and enabled his winged Gregor Henry to get a fifth application for the economy.
The Still Game series star starts a career in the gastronomic industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, seems to start business in the gastronomic industry. Recently it was discovered that he was the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC station site. Hemphillem, together with his multi-year comedy partner, is performing and co-operating the series.
Duet announced that the next nine season will be the last in the series history. Everything points out that Ford Kiernan is planning the future after the abandonment of Craiglang.
According to the official data, he became Director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although the Scottish Sun informant suggested that Kiernan is trying to engage in the "developmental gastronomic industry" in Glasgow.
"The Sea belongs to us": deprived of access to the sea Bolivia lives hope that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The Marines are patrolling the base of the Navy in La Paz.
There are blue flags in public buildings.
In the port of the Navy war from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the following motto is stated: “The sea is ours under the law.
His recovery is our duty."
In the lack of access to the Bolivian sea, the mention of a shoreline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict with the resources of the 19th century is still alive.
These hopes may be greater than a few decades. Bolivia expects the ruling of the International Court of Justice. It will be issued on 1 October after a five-year trial.
"Bolivia's actions are taking a turn. The residents are unanimous, optimistically set up and count on a beneficial verdict," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will jointly see the International Court of Justice meeting. They hope that the organization with the headquarters in The Hague recognizes Bolivia's claim and, after decades of free talks, Chile will have to join the negotiations on granting independent country access to the sea.
Evo Morales, charismatic president of Bolivia, who will be present next year for an ongoing debate on the fight against reelection, also gives hope in the Monday's ruling.
“We are very close to the return to the Pacific” – he reached the end of August.
Some analysts say, however, that the chances for Bolivia’s benefit are small and that even the acceptable decision would not change much.
The United Nations Office at The Hague has no authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. It has also observed that it will not affect the establishment of any talks.
As Paz Zárate said, Chile's expert on international law, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the submission of the final arguments.
Unfortunately, Bolivia has been able to distance the country from its destination for the past four years.
"The issue of access to the sea was shared by the current Bolivian administration," Paz Zárate said.
The unparalleled rhetoric of Morales freed the Chileans from any remaining good will, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult in the face of the present situation.
In the case of both countries, there has been no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz, former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the view that the court's decision-making process was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relation to relations with Chile" and the possibility to "end the 139-year period of disputes with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — used the subject of access to the sea as an element of political play.
"Bolivia never renounces the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is a great opportunity to make sure that we have to cope with the past."
North Korean owners claim that nuclear disarmament will not occur until they can trust the United States.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people will never get rid of nuclear weapons until they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared at a time when the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to be on the verge of re-establishing a suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Unem.
Ri claims that the "cold" is as if there was no abolition of sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean war had ever thrown North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not wish to agree to signing a declaration without prior taking concrete disarmament steps by Pjongang.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pjongangang seriously approaches the elimination of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only security-guarantee.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris' fashion shows announce the emergence of the latest big lines to cover heads in clothing stores.
If you want to expand your collection of chapels or completely hide before the sun, we have good information for you.
The fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy, over-reached heads that were part of their 2019 summer collection, which gloated with style during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
The unusually unpracticed chapels were on the Instagram of this year. These designers decided to present their dazzling creations on the run.
The distinguished part of Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a wide, pier-shaped round of models.
Other extra-dimensional accessories included arboises decorated with cloths, magic hats, and even pineapple — but they were not designed to warm their heads.
Thom Browne also showed a number of special masks — at the same time on Halloween.
Many colored masks had long-haired lips and reminded of more Hannibal Lecter's style than the haute couture.
One creation reminded the diving equipment with the pipe and the glasses, and another looked like a dissolved ice.
And if you don't want to break up with a big fashion, you're lucky.
Style watchers provide that huge hats can reach clothing stores.
The unmatched chapels follow the "La Bomba", a broken chapel with a width of 61 cm, all of which have already worn from Rihanny to Emily Ratajkovsky.
The cultural brand behind this unusually unpracticed chapel, which was crossed by social media, presented another great creation — a broken beach bag almost as large as the model worn in the bathroom.
Incinerated orange bag from rafia, finished with rafia fried and crushed with a white leather hand, was distinguished in the collection Jacquemus La Riviera for the summer 2019 season during the fashion week Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, star-stylist, said FEMAIL: “I hope that large chapels and beach bags will appear in the shops next year — because the designer has been able to make such a big impact, it would be difficult not to use the demand for extra-dimensional accessories”.
John Edward: Language skills needed for the world's citizens
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements — in 2018 they were able to praise the following outstanding results of exams, individual and collective success support in sports, art, music and other social activities.
Representatives of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) schools, to which more than 30,000 students are enrolled throughout Scotland, aim to provide the best level of services provided to students and parents.
The aim of schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, selected by them for career careers and to show them their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the possibility of developing and implementing a school-adjusted learning programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to another person in a language that he understands, then he will get it to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, he'll get to his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages take the first place in league rankings, with the highest rates of flexibility for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages gained a higher rating of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received higher grades A in Mandarin and 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as necessary skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, language learning, as subjects for choice, is conducted in the same extent as that of STEM subjects (student sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) within the framework of education programmes in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) showed that there was a 17 per cent shortage of language candidates due to the difficulty of occupying job vacancies.
As a result, more and more language skills become necessary to prepare young people for career start.
These skills are necessary in a globalised world with the growing number of jobs requiring language skills,
A lifelong learning skills, such as learning a second language, will provide a tremendous advantage in the future, regardless of the path of professional development.
The possibility of direct agreement with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of multilingual people in relation to competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov, in which more than 4,000 adult British people participated, 75% of them could not speak in a foreign language so well to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language whose percentage of people using was two-digit, i.e. 15%.
Therefore, investing in the learning of foreign languages is so important for today’s children.
The knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of the developing economies, will give children more opportunities to find suitable employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in terms of its language.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for Britain in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, there will always be many languages in independent schools to choose which will be taught by specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scottish schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to achieve success — regardless of what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that the international business environment still has a key role to play in the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a great choice, diversity and level.
That's just right.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut at the Lakers team on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans who wanted to see LeBron James' debut in Los Angeles Lakers were finally waiting.
Luke Walton, coach of Lakers, announced that LeBron James was playing a Sunday pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
It's not known how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one, but less than 48," Walton said on the official website of the Lakers team.
The reporter of the Lakers team, Mike Trudell, on Twitter announced that James is most likely playing a incomplete number of minutes.
After the training that took place at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers matches.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to take part in pre-season games to prepare," he said.
The West Virginia trumpet, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight at Wheeling in West Virginia with a series of electoral events.
It's the first of five of the polling stations planned by Trump, which will take place next week, along with positions in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Along with a vote confirming that his election to hold a free position in the Supreme Trump Court is seeking to build support in the forthcoming elections in the mid-term of the governments, as the Republics may be in danger of losing control of the Congress when the votes will be cast in November.
What time is it going to be tonight to pick the Trump in West Virginia and where will it be possible to see him on the Internet?
So the Trump in Wheeling in West Virginia will take place today at 19.00, i.e. Saturday, 29 September 2018.
So the trumpet in West Virginia will be able to be monitored live by the Internet on YouTube.
The Trump will probably refer to this week's hearings of the candidate nominated to the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugha, who took place in a tense atmosphere due to proposals for improper sexual behaviour, as well as the proposed vote in the Senate on the suspension of the election for a maximum period of one week, during the investigation by the FBI.
However, the main objective of this series of electoral campaigns is to support the Republics facing difficult November elections.
So President Trump's five-week campaign is aimed at "mobilizing volunteers and supporters to help the Republics protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives" — Reuters.
"Congress control is such an important point in the President's timetable that, as the hottest season of the campaign approaches, he will visit as many states as possible," said Trump's spokesman, who did not grant his name — Reuters.
Today's election in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the attention of the Pittsburgh media" — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump visits West Virginia — a state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia candidate to the Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisey, who loses in the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist from West Virginia University — Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows the spirit of the struggle, with the hope of winning in Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format that took place on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The growing volume of divorce is a completely invented sport concept, but the one in which racers really believe, and already the most in such professions as these.
So what's their gap at this point?
"They've run six points, and now they're only running four, so I think we've got a little gap," Jordan Speeth said.
Europe, of course, is running four points, while there are still twelve.
The Americans, as Spieth says, however, feel the wind in the frogs and have good patterns to follow, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each of them could praise himself by obtaining three points out of four.
Speeth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
The screams on the entire throat, which is a sign of excitement, became more louder during the course of his round, waving the key gate and winning the match when he and Thomas got two dolls in two hits.
His plot on the ground that won them the 15th resulted in a similar cry — one that makes it clear that the American team is still in play.
"It's enough to focus and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of each of these racers.
18 dolls to win.
The only players who in the last two days have gained more points than Spieth and Thomas, were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unmistakable story of Ryder Cup.
Strange, but the lovely couple of the European team won four of them and didn't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't count Godey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided Godeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back on Friday morning.
The way in which the game and how their energy seems to flow to and from the violent crowd proves that it is necessary to beat these players on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari, who could mark the potential victory of the European team on Le Golf National.
It would be best to play on different dolls at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the early hero of fourball when he was confronted with Alex Noren.
Boley and the doubles on the front of them dug Spain and Sweden into a hole from which they would never get out.
There's no one on Sunday to help get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between the funds, the advice they make, the advice they do not make, and how the strategy can be changed at one point.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has taken a significant advantage of the last day, but the forum session has also shown that the United States team is involved in a fight in which some, especially in the States, have doubted.
Europe with 10-6 results includes driving on the final day of Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after winning the 10-6 Saturday fourball matches and foursomes with the United States.
Inspired duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — has won a prize, two winnings over the fighting Tiger Woods, increasing its current Le Golf National score to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorna, trying to maintain the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an insignificant American team in the early form of fourball, winning a 3-1 series.
The United States has put greater resistance in the form of foursomes, winning two matches, but they could not undo the loss.
To maintain the trophy, Jim Furyk team has to get eight points out of 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter who won four points in a row, while with Molinarim (the club was called Molliwood after a sensational weekend) are only the second couple in the history of Ryder Cup, which won four points in four opening matches.
After the downfall of Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball format, they beat the excellent-styled Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau, gaining an even more empathic result of 5&4.
Woods, who was bored by two Saturdays, occasionally showed genius lights, but lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourball and foursome formats, and that's seven out of a row.
Justin Rose, who was not involved in the early fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in foursome format to win 2+1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopka, who are taking positions 1 and 3 respectively in the world ranking.
The European team, however, did not all go in the sense of this pleasant, cold day in the field driven to the south-west of Paris.
The three-fold winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference point for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory with the result of 2&1 over Hispane Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball format and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with the result of 4&3 in foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup did the team make a four-point loss, starting with a single, although the Furyk team would only have a resis to keep the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, Sunday contract seems to be rather unlikely.
North Korea says "standby no" to unilateral disarmament without confidence.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said Saturday during the UN statement that the lack of sanctions only deepens the lack of confidence in North Korea in the United States and there is no way that the country will unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" last year, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and the obligation to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we do not see any concrete response from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be no mention of the unilateral disarmament of North Korea."
While Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's failure to comply with the "step" approach to denuclearisation, which would reward North Korea for its gradual action, his statement seemed to be significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation, as in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first in history at the summit between the official president of the United States and the leader of North Korea, which took place on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un committed himself to working for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", and Trump promised the security guarantees of North Korea.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean war (from 1950 to 1953), but the United States representative announced that Pyongyang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington also relied on calls for the relief of the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States is responsible for "denuclearisation in the first order" and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced way, even contrary to the signature of "war ending declaration," Ri said.
"The fact that sanctions can put us on our knees is a bunch of people who behave in a way that is ignorant of us.
The problem, however, is that the absence of sanctions deepens our confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which he spoke about at the beginning of the week of the United States leader at the UN Forum.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months: "If the party on denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, then there was no such impact on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was completely different compared to the last year, when the UN General Assembly said that the elimination of North Korea missiles in the United States was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump (Mr. Evil President Trump) called Kim Jong Una "rocket man" (a rocket man) on a suicide mission.
This year, at the UN Trump Forum, which threatened "total destruction" of North Korea, Kim Jong Una praised for his courage to take steps to disarm, but also said that there was still a need to put a lot of work on the ground, and also said that until North Korea is released, sanctions will not be abolished.
In the midst of Trump said he did not appoint a time zone, saying: “No matter whether it takes two years, three years, or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council Forum: "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be continued and continued until we find full, final and verified denuclearisation".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously highlighted sanctions against North Korea, trying to slow down funding for the nuclear programme and ballistic missiles in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly Forum and later said he would visit Pjongang again next month as part of preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called success.
He left Pjongang in July, saying that progress had been made, after which North Korea had condemned him for "putting gangster demands" within a few hours.
North Korea committed itself this month to meeting with Moon Jae-in, that it will dismantle the missile testing site and the nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate measures.
He stated that Kim Jong Un told him that "appropriate measures" to which he depended were security guarantees to ensure that Trump was committed to Singapore and that steps were taken to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend the course for adequate long rest
The new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, provided all students with more dreams, aimed at combating the growing culture of macho, which is taught by "caffeine-powered students all night".
Students from the best university in the world often have no idea of the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of this type in the United States.
To create a course, he was inspired by his speech about the impact of sleep depression on science.
"After the talk, one girl came to me and said, "Why am I saying this right now when I'm in my last year of study?"
She said that no one ever told her about the meaning of the dream that surprised me," The Telegraph said.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, students learn how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in science and sport, and improve the overall feeling of students.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the health care department, said that this course was intended to be introduced after it was found that the students suffered from severe sleeplessness during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of the peace in the academy, where students click to coffee, screens, exercises and books to get information about the influence of caffeine and light and how sleep failure affects sports outcomes, and how it is important to keep sleep regular.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this does not cause an immediate change in student behaviour.
But we believe they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know the health consequences of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride from "all-night science" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students means a growing problem of sleeplessness.
Ensuring a sufficient amount of good quality sleep should be a "secret weapon" of students fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even avoiding weight loss, as lack of sleep causes the brain to go into the mode of hunger, which causes the student to be constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler to develop a course after taking part in one of his activities last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press the course for the whole campus.
The next step is to invite all students of postgraduate studies to complete a similar programme of studies before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up a warning alarm when to go to sleep and when to get up, and that they be aware of the harmful effect of the "blue light" emitted by electronic devices and LED lighting, which can solve the daily rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga works for Gerrard team
The Rangers again suffered during the struggle to get out of Livingstone, when Dolly Menga shot his shot to defeat Steven Gerrard's disassembled team, achieving the result of 1-0.
The team from the Ibrox Stadium wanted to record their first victory from the February 4-1 victory over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard in 18 matches, causing for his team a difference of eight points in terms of leader Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga shot naked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' composition showing a lack of commitment didn't seem to improve.
While Rangers scored a sixth, Livingstone succeeded in a third — that is, for Hibernian with one goal.
The Rangers team may have further difficulties as a result of the need to take care of the wound of Judge Caluma Spence's head line after he has been hit by the object thrown out of the guest's tent.
Gerrard introduced eight changes in the team, which allowed him to go ahead and go to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt, on the other hand, went through with the same eleven of Livingston, who took the point of the Hearts team last week, being fascinated by the way his well-trained team tortured each step of its opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but the Livingston team did more with the ball when they got it.
They should have scored a goal in just two minutes, when the first release of the ball through Menga allowed Scott Pittman to compete with the gate of Allan McGregor, but the assistant didn't use his chance.
Then Keaghan Jacobs addressed a deep release to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow playing in the defensive position could only remain in the rear position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quadrant, but it looked like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he had been sent to prison for fifteen minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless fell on himself, but Judge Steven Thomson had developed the Colombian claim.
The Rangers managed to deliver only two customs shots in the first half, but there were ex-Ibrox gatekeeper Liam Kelly, who was barely worried about the head of Lassany Coulibaly and I was weakly shooting Oviego Ejaria.
While Livingstone won the 34 minute goal of opening the match could be counter to the running game, no one can deny that they earned it for the effort it put into its winning.
The Rangers again failed to deal with the deep, steady fragment of the game performed by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher threw a ball into Scott Robinson, who kept it quiet, giving it to Meng for a simple completion of the action.
Gerrard did not empty out on the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. This change almost immediately had an effect on the wing that threw a ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it, getting it from his position.
The Livingston team continued to get guests into the game exactly the way they liked it when Lithgow and Halkett had long given each other.
Holt's team could have increased driving in the last few minutes, but McGregor stood up to Jacobs, after which Lithow took the game off the trigger.
The Rangers Reserve, Glenn Middleton, had another hope for a sentence when he broke up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes again.
German: finder of Geiger
And now page of our Sunday Morning edition Almanac: September 30, 1882 — 136 years ago... the day he was born in Germany came the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as Geiger's counter.
Since then, Geiger has become an element of both science and pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", where you have had little chance of cowboy-scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What is wrong with this?"
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s computer that is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you start these hearings, you'll hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: "Now hear something!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survived to this day.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the cells' enemies.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "warn" the enemy cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise the enemies of the cell in the course of treatment.
This method is used to separate the patient's immune cells and change them into the laboratory.
Then they can "see" the protein in common for many new ones. Then they are injected into the body again.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of tumours.
In one woman treated with a vaccine, the immune system of identifying the enemies of the cell has been observed for more than 18 months.
The method is to separate the immune cells from the patient, to change them into the laboratory, so that they can "see" the protein common to many new cells called HER2 and then inject the patient into these cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that this vaccine is very good".
HER2 "stirring the growth of several types of tumors", including breast, ovaries, lungs and pelvic glands, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the collection of resistant cells from patients and the "learning" of their localization of tumour cells has been to treat certain types of protein.
Kanye West is on a pro-trump diet in Saturday Night Live, with a MAGA head cap.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was "exploited" in a studio during the course of the Saturday Night Live program after President Donald Trump praised the United States and said he would apply for the office in 2020.
After this night's performance of his third titled Ghost Town, in which he had a titled "Make America Great" hat, he took the lead against the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
"When I talk to white people, I hear, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
If I cared about racism, I would've been out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL programme started with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star praised Bretta Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judicial commission on sexual assault charges filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although he was not broadcast, the video from West was sent to the social media by the comics of Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock wanted to lick West by putting in a post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems with his hat behind the scenes.
"They took me behind the scenes.
They told me not to come out with that hat on my head.
They're all over me!
And then they say I don't have a way out," said Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you say I don't have a way out?" adding, "I'm going to set up a superman pillar, so you won't be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Let's accept it."
His words were twice the "suffering" of the public, and the members of the SNL team seemed to be in trouble — he brings Variety. A person who was in the study during these events: "The study had a grave silence".
West was invited to the program in place of the songwriter Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West was intrigued by the many works of I Love it in the water bottle Perrier.
West received support from the conservative leader of the TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who put the following tweet: “To one of the most important: JOIN THE MAFILL CHALLENGE”.
The leader of Karen Hunter's show on her Twitter said that the West was just "being himself and it's absolutely wonderful".
"But I'm NOT going to reward people (by buying their music or clothes or by supporting their "arts") who, I think, accept and take seriously the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
That's how we're free," she said.
Prior to the rapper program, he announced on Twitter that he changed his name and that he now "formically called Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name — he follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed the name to symbol, and then an artist known as Prince.
Trying to kill a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of trying to kill after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
This happened in Ballyhackamore as the police bring it.
The accused is to be brought to the Court of Justice in Belfast on Monday.
The defendants will be investigated by the prosecutor.
Star Games of the throne Kit Harington triggers the toxic male issue
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval HBO series "Game of throne".
The 31-year-old actor hit the stereotype hero macho, saying that showing such roles on the screen causes young boys often think they have to play hard to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit found that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the toxic problem of manhood in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his partner from the throne game plan, the 31-year-old actor Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt "a long way off", moving the issue.
“I personally feel quite certain at this point — where we made a mistake on the subject of manhood?” he said.
"What did we teach men when they were growing up, looking at the perspective of the problem we are currently dealing with?"
Kit believes that for the development of toxic male, television can be partly responsible for the presentation of highly male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are born, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets, what makes young boys start to think they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think it is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change it?
It's obvious that everything isn't okay with young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he was no longer playing in any prequel or sequel games after the end of the series the following year, saying that he “ended with the fields of battles and horses”.
From November Kit will play the art "True West" Sam Shepard, which is a story about a film producer and his brother – a thief.
The actor recently found that he considered knowing his wife Rose to be the best thing that ever happened to him in the Games of the throne.
"I met my wife on the plan, which gave me my future family and a new life," he said.
In this many-time award for Emma Rose’s fantasy series, Ygritte played — an object of loving interest in the character of Kita, Jon Snow.
In June 2018, the couple took possession of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Chinese record a 14-percent increase in new cases
China reported a 14-percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this problem, as health care workers do.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
A determined majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which means a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of a transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost completely reduced, as Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 per year.
The transfer of HIV by sex is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination in LGBT society is widespread.
Given the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with men will eventually get married.
Many cases of disease transmission result from insufficient safety while having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has provided universal access to HIV drugs in an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters objected to the fact that one of her team members revealed data to the senators of the Republican Party — "hazardous lies" and "theory of censuses".
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a member of the United States Chamber of Representatives, dismissed the charges as if a member of her team had placed personal data of three Republican senators on Wikipedia's side of the legislators.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party has ensured that these charges have been removed by experts and websites related to the "ultra-recording shields".
"Truths, lies, and even more unmistakable lies," Waters reported on Twitter.
Public information also included home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. She was placed by an unknown person in the Capitol during a panel hearing in the Senate on sexual abuse charges against the Supreme Court of Britt Kavanaugh.
The leak took place some time after the Qavanaugh candidate was questioned by three senators.
Conservatives, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the post was associated with the Waters office and published information about a member of the Waters team, as Hill says.
"This baseless offer is totally false and is a hundred percent lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security were violated as a result of these frauds and false accusations — was not in any way responsible for the outcome of this information.
This baseless offer is totally false and it's a hundred percent lie."
Waters’s statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including by Ari Fleischer, a former press spokesman for the White House.
"This kind of rejection is evil," Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests that she does not have the right temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he can't be angry.
He can't provoke.
He may not question the motives of the accused person.
It's got to be quiet for that."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of showing excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"A rough case, if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed “the competent authorities and the prosecution authorities of these misleading charges”.
"The rapporteurs will be disarmed and drawn to legal responsibility for all their actions that pose a threat to any member of my team," she announced.
Review by Johnny English: Nokaut — Spanish parody with a weakened Red Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in every new film with a British thread has already become a norm. It seems to apply in the case of a new part of a series of films from the "Johnny English" action and comedy, which began in 2003 with the film "Johnny English" and which returned to screens in 2011 with the film "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Will the self-concealing satire about how hopeless we are become a new export commodity in the country?
In any event, forever amazed, with a rubber face, the incompetent Johnny English has been relicted for sharing — his name and name more than anything else signals that he is a built-up, comical product for non-English-language vision.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent, who despite his strange tastes for smoothie glamour has a little bit from Inspector Clouseau, Jasi Fasoli's shot and a drop from this guy adding one need to the tune of the lead character Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In the past he was also a traveler and a world mystery man — Atkinson once played in the already forgotten TV ads Barclaycard, in which he remained in chaos.
In the latest film in the Johnny English series, there is one or two moments worth of attention.
I liked the scene in which Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in a medium-sized weapon, while his helmet was beat rhythmically by the blades of a squirrel.
On the screen you can clearly see the gift of Atkinson for the physical play of comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low and unnecessary, especially that currently also "significant" film brands, such as 007 and Mission No, offer comedy elements as part of the film composition.
The humorous elements seem to be directed rather to children rather than adults — according to me, Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as creative and consistent as the gagas in his non-atkinson movies about Jasi Fasoli.
From an ever-present standpoint, the UK has serious problems.
Cyberhaker is moving into the British super-secret network of spies, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the field — to the fear of the agent in the service, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last drop in the magic burning premiere, which is a promiscuous, depressed figure already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in her power, aiming at being Theresy May, but the script does not allow her to develop wings.
Her advisors from the intelligence agency inform her that because of the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
This means that Johnny English in his own person, currently employed as a teacher in an elegant school, who teaches informal lessons about how to become a secret agent — a few bad gagas during the teaching of espionage by English.
English is invited to Whitehall for execution, once again connecting with his former assistant, Bough, again bordered by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with the commander of the submarine — a cheerful but somewhat tired figure played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin share in the secret service of Her Royal City back to action, meeting the beautiful woman fatal Ophelia Bulletin, the character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously dominated by a charismatic technological billionaire who claims that he can solve the computer problems of the United Kingdom — he is the villain Jason Volt, bordered by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their crucifixion from absurd situations: the waiters are being taken for the French restaurant; they start chaos, moving on to Volty's luxury yacht; and English is getting laid off when using the set to virtual reality to get to know Volty's home.
In this last sequence, all restrictions are gone, but despite the nice and humorous performance, the entire film is very much a reminder of television for children.
A typical medium.
Like other movies in the Johnny English series, I couldn't resist thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that would really correspond to his talent?
The Working Party rejects as if it was drawing up a plan which provides for a four-day week of work for the British, for which they will receive a five-day remuneration
The work of Jeremy Corbyn will consider introducing a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week, receiving a five-day salary.
Similarly, the party wants the company's bosses to pass on to the rescue workers the revolution related to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) giving them an additional day off.
This would allow the employees to enjoy the same amount of remuneration on a three-week weekend.
The sources suggest that this idea "will be included" in the economic programme of the parties and plans of departure of the country against workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from change in the economy.
The senior member of the Labour Party in the discussion with The Sunday Times said: "It is expected that a policy change will be announced before the end of this year."
"This will not happen from day to day, but the four-day work week is something that is reflected in the party's approach to restoring the economic balance for the benefit of the employee, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party committed to introducing a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, these plans are currently not supported by all members of the Labour Party.
The Party of Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not a party's policy and its introduction is not considered by it".
John McDonnell, the Chancellor of the Office of Shadows, used the last week's conference of the Working Party to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "no-faced directors" and "speculators" in public utility companies.
The Chancellor's plans from the shadow office also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not regain their full participation, as the Government of the Labour Party could make “deductions” on the basis of detected abuses.
He also confirmed plans for the placement of employees in company boards and the creation of own-funds integration funds to transfer 10 per cent of own-funds from the private sector to private employees who receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer in the program "60 minutes" to ask if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their attitude
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least a week and has raised questions as to whether the establishment of the office of inquiry could allow the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday, Scott Pelley will be conducting a 60-minute program asking Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find something that could lead to a change in their attitude.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened when this proposal appeared, and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was stable, determined and consistent."
However, Graham's opinion seems to be cut out in stone.
"I made a decision about Bretta Kavanaugh and to change it requires a strong commitment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett firmly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“Not one of the people who gave it was able to verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything's gonna change."
What is the event of the Global Citizen Festival, and to what extent has it contributed to reducing poverty?
The next Saturday in New York will be the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that can be honored by the impressive composition of the stars and the equally impressive mission — the elimination of poverty in the world.
The seven Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the realization of the most important objective of this event, which is the liquidation of the extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group working to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to this event (unless they decided to buy a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or "acts", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the world leader, making a phone call or other important activities to help raise awareness of the purpose of eradicating poverty.
But what success can the Global Citizen enjoy in the 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of awarding free people a concert a good way to convince them to take action, or another case of so-called "clickivism" when people feel they are doing something important by signing a petition online or by placing a post on Twitter?
The Global Citizen organization claims that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million "acts" of people supporting the action, seeking to achieve many different goals.
It also states that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce their commitments and provisions of more than 37 billion dollars, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group committed 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, which have already paid or financed at least $10 billion.
The Group considers that the security measures have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and contractors engaged in "helping children to achieve their full potential", which promised to transfer to Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in that country, after Global Citizens sent over 4700 tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens, such as you, we can make social injustices, which is inexperience, go back to history" — Tracey Ullman, Ambassador Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, following over 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve the quality of the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which reaches up to 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
For one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which sounded "Why are you sure that extreme poverty will be eliminated?",
The Global Citizen responded: “This will be a long and difficult path — sometimes we will run and lose.
But just as in the case of the recent major movements towards civil rights and the fight against apartheid, we will be successful, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the stars that take place during this year's New York event, whose hosts will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use a Navy warlock to block Russian exports of energy — Interior Secretary
Washington may "if necessary" flee to its military navy to prevent Russian energy flows to the markets, including those in the Middle East, has revealed the Secretary of Home Affairs of the United States, Ryan Zinke, Washington Examiner.
Zinke maintained that Russia’s commitment to Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of the government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think that the reason why they are in the Middle East is the desire to trade in energy, as is the case in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States has the opportunity to ensure that the maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, to create a barrier to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that itself identifies itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is less dependent on the use and substitution of fuels," he said, comparing Russia to a "one-piece-knowing bitch" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements appeared at a time when the Trump administration continued its mission to increase the exports of greenhouse gas to Europe, which is much cheaper for European consumers than for Russian gas.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "non-use" Nord Stream 2 gas project, which according to Trump made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth 11 billion dollars, which is intended to double the existing capacity to 110 billion metres, is a project of an economic nature only.
Kreml argues that Washington's jealous opposition to the implementation of this project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with the US Secretary of Energy in the United States of America in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States called for a violent response from Germany, which confirmed their commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation of Germany, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think this is a big problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting of Chancellor Angeli Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said he would consider candidate for president in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday that after the mid-term elections he would consider running for the president.
At a meeting in Hollywood in Massachusetts Warren, she confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair the corrupt government. This is also true for women who have the highest position," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will consider my candidacy as President."
At Warren's meeting, she mentioned President Donald Trump, saying "he's driving the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren without a garden voiced her criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote: "Of course we need an FBI poll before the vote."
However, published on Thursday, the poll showed that most Warren voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters choosing the option "probably" said that the senator should not run from a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy — 38 percent of the people supported his potential candidacy, and 48 percent of the people opposed it.
Other known names from the democratic camp taken into account for the potential candidate in 2020 were Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, as the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about the stress group (PTSD) Track Palin during the election age Donald Trump
Track Palin (26 years) spent a year in Iraq after moving to the military in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, through which he has to go back, I understand other families that feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are returning with," said the public at the election age Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son's arrest "the subject of taboo", after which she said about her son and other war veterans: "They return a little changed, return the trained, return, wonder whether respect will be shown for what their fellow soldiers, the airlines and all other members of the army have given away to their country."
He was arrested on Monday at Vasilli in Alaska and accused of domestic violence against women, of calling for false testimony in the report on domestic violence and of the possession of weapons in a state of terror, as Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilli Police Department.
18 states and the District of Colombia support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge for the new United States policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts in Washington, D.C., filed a letter of friendly curie on Friday to support the asylum-seeker who is struggling with this policy — as the NBC News reports.
The full name of the reason in Grace v. Sessions, which American Civil Liberties Union organization filed in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his brutal sons from the gang" were fighting against her, but on July 20th, the US officials rejected her application for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors of the states supporting Grace described Salwador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are many asylum seekers in the United States, as countries struggling with widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy has repealed the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision, which has enabled undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of the District of Colombia, said in a Friday statement that the new policy " ignores existing state, federal and international law for decades".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle," as stated in the list of friends of the Curie.
The prosecutors continued to argue in the letter that the policy of refusing entry to immigrants would harm the US economy, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and "be a necessary labour force".
In June, the Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Assil is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national or belonging to a particular social group or having such other political convictions," Sessions said in its statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems — even the serious ones — that people from all over the world struggle with every day.
Disappointmental rescue attempts in Pala, when the number of victims doubled in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, it became more and more tragic.
"It is a very intense feeling," said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, comforting her burned-out son in an evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance imports the body.
There's no clean water."
Residents were seen returning to destroyed homes, searching for water - laden things, and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees, were quickly overcrowded.
Some wounded, including Two Haris, who had experienced fractures in the spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palus, where patients were treated outside due to severe secondary shocks.
The tears filled his eyes as he spoke of a violent earthquake on the ground, which shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
I think I was pushed into the Romanian wall" – Haris said Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for marriage.
"I heard my wife cry for help after which her voice escaped.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The Ambassador of the United States of America accuses China of "suffering" advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-sided advertisement in the American newspaper praising the mutual benefits of US-Chinese trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China’s Daily Supplement to Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — accusing China of trying to interfere with the United States Congress, which will be held on November 6th — China rejects this charge.
The trump about Beijing's trying to get to the U.S. elections, confirmed what US officials told the Reuters agency that this is a new step in escalating a campaign by Washington aimed at producing pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently escalating a trade war that has led to increased tariffs for mutual imports.
Chinese tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to be affected by exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported the Republic of Trump — Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China, and former governor of the state of Iowa — the main exporter of agricultural products to China — said that Beijing had committed a crime against American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in a Sunday article in the Des Moines Register that China "now with double force begins to frown, placing propaganda advertising in our own free press".
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using a respected American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, placing a paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
For this, there will be no opposition votes on the street in Beijing and no real reflection of the differing opinions that Chinese may have on the disturbing economic direction of China, given that the media is under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most well-known Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans react to the mid-term elections of women with the right to vote in the Kavanaugh area, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans support and weapons appointed to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh in the face of several charges of sexual assault, the analyst warns that your members are meeting during the upcoming mid-term elections with a violent reaction, especially by women.
The emotions associated with this event are extremely great, and most Republicans are already officially willing to vote.
"This can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts as to whether Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizona) efforts to conduct a recent investigation by the FBI were enough to calm the angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it this morning and they will not forget it until November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the MoveOn group – as the newspaper published in Washington said.
On Friday morning, the protesters scandalized the word "Friday", demonstrating in the House of the Senate because of the decision of the Republicans controlling the Judicial Commission not to withdraw the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as Mic said.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation goes beyond the scale," said one of the information pages of Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst.
“People say that he was already tall — and that’s true.
But it may be higher, especially among undecided women from the suburbs and younger electors from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before the Ford public recognition, in which she described in detail her allegations of sexual assault addressed to the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republic had decided to approve the candidacy, it could have a violent reaction.
"The Republican Party has to deal with a small mess," said at the beginning of last week, Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, as NBC News reports.
"It is not only the vote of the Commission or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it is also the way the Republic has dealt with the situation and how Ford was dealt with," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities of the United States, on one of the information channels.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided into those who believe in the face of the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more support.
The new YouTube survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believed in Ford's testimony or rather believed, while 35 percent found that they believed in Kavanaugh's testimony or rather believed in Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% of the respondents found that Kavanaugh was probably or probably lied at the time of the testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's press release, the FBI began an investigation into the charges dropped by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, who is Deborah Ramirez, as The Guardian reports.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate Judicial Commission that Kavanaugh under the influence of alcohol attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that he showed her his genitalia during his studies at Yale University in the 1980 ’ s.
The World Wide Web company plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Team Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web network, launches a startup that is to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform — Solid — owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who have access to specific information.
In an exclusive statement for Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the purpose of creating Inrupt is "dominance over the world".
"We have to do it now," he said, referring to the start.
"The historical moment has come."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own "internet store with personal data" or other POD.
It can contain contact lists, mailing lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of the internet store with personal data is that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls it "personal power through data".
According to the company's president, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
Currently, Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of developers employed in the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology makers around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, which from day to day leads to the top of all their business models.
"Don't ask them for permission."
On Saturday, on the medium platform, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has had a great deal to do in the debate on network neutrality.
Invoking the Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely excited to think about the next era in the development of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Marking the spiritual Victorian Cross during World War I
The memory of the only Church of England, which in World War I as a combatant was marked by the Victorian Cross, was taught 100 years later in its home town.
Major Bernard Vann was nominated on 29 September 1918 for the stage at Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he was marked by the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandsons discovered a monumental stone during the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that the stone was revealed exactly in the hundredth anniversary of Grandpa's marking was "extremely symbolic".
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the Vann fleet led its battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very dense mgle and under a strong shield from the field and machine guns".
He then rushed to the fire line and with “the greatest courage” led her to move forward, after which he singled out an attack on the position of the field, destroying three of them.
The Battle of Vann was killed by the German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72 years) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never be able to do, but at the same time be humble”.
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, he placed the winner after the end of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored, able to participate in paradise” and added that “the courage of a true hero is manifested in the support he receives from many people”.
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, instead get the Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to watch out for the packed emotions of Bellator 206 and can't finally see the main fight.
The program could include 13 races in San Jose, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the battle, the visions in Britain were amazed at the change of the program for Peppe.
Some were disappointed when they didn't sleep until the early hours of the morning especially after seeing this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the replacement for children as "some sick joke".
"In accordance with the Government's regulation, the content of this type is inadequate to allow it to be released at 6 a.m., which required a change in the programme for children," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the Bellator marketing and communication organisation when asked for a transmission.
"Peppa's pig, yes."
The president of Bellator's organization, Scott Coker, said they are working on a schedule to take into account future visions from Britain.
"When I think about reversing the situation, I think we can fix it," Coker said.
"But it's Sunday 6th morning, so we won't be able to cope with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change in the program, we had a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical boost.
But it wasn't just a legal issue.
I can promise you that this situation will not happen again.
We're going to limit the program to five fights instead of six — to a standard amount.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt worse because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jump, says he grew up feeling worse than anyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to bring success.
24-year-old said he didn't realize everyone was like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs radio 4 station, Lauren Laverne said he was talking about gay rights to give another "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent would make him less concerned with winning the Olympics.
The usual leader of this program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months free of the disease.
As he appeared in the programme for the first time led by Laverne, Daley said that as he grew up, he felt "less valuable" than others, because "the simultaneous love of boys and girls was not socially acceptable".
He said: “To this day, feeling less worth and being different is something that gives me the strength to be successful. ”
He said he wanted to prove that he was "something worth it" so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
A twice-brown Olympic medalist became a vocalist in the LGBT community and used his speech in this year's Community of Nations Games in Australia to appeal to a larger number of countries for the discrimination of homosexuality.
He said he decided to express himself because he felt happy, that he could live open, without any involvement, and that he wanted to give another "hope".
Three times the world’s champion said that a man’s love — the American filmmaker Dustinie Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “was surprised. ”
Daley married Oscar (who is 20 years older than him) last year, marking that this age difference was never a problem for him.
"When you go through so much at such a young age," he meant his first 14-year-old Olympics and father's death three years later, "it was hard for him to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar strokes and falls.
The couple stayed in June with the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that he had completely changed his perception of certain things.
"The most important thing for me last year was to win the gold medal," he said.
"And you know what? It's more important than the gold Olympic medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was whether he had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 — he wanted to take the lead.
"I couldn't tell him: "You won't be with us to be in the first place," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing. Just when he stopped breathing and died, I understood that he was not uninhabited," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bridge.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life – jumping into the water before a crowd of people in the Olympic Games – it was the best feeling of the possible," he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — the Conduct of Heather Small — that accompanied him during preparations for the Olympic Games and that continues to make him a slender skin.
Desert Island Discs program is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Displaying lack of Mikkelson shape on the bench during the Saturday part of Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match at Ryder Cup, but he will have to work on his form so that he doesn't print his fifth.
Mickelson, who played for twelve at the event every two years, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for fourball games and foursomes.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as often was the case in the United States team, the five-time main winner had to spend a day on team climbing and working on improving his game in order to correct the cause of his shipment to the bench.
A 48-year-old who never gave the simplest hits, even at the top of his career, is not well tested on the tight Le Golf National field, on which the wrong hits are unfathomably punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not encouraging enough for Mickelsson, on Sunday's ninth match, he must face the exact winner of the British Open — Francesco Molinari, who joined forces with the recipient Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If America (with a loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) starts the game with a worm, the Mickelson game may prove extremely key.
Fury expressed confidence in his rival — he could not do anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, stuck me behind his back, hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"He's very sure of himself.
He is in the gallery of fame and has led many of his teams to the game both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was playing two matches.
I thought they'd be more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we had to do.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will kill Nick Faldo's record of the Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mean the end of his career at Ryder Cup, which never matched his individual achievement.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven remissions on his account. Fury said his presence led a lot to the team.
"It's funny, sarcastic, funny, funny and it's good to have it in the team's room," he explained.
"I think young players were having a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He's bringing his person a lot more than just a game."
Captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that a great deal of points can be cut short soon.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point of view before starting a single on the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in a game in the Valderram field, where along with his accompanying Vice-Chairman Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the line of years passed at the shortest of possible hair, winning 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"Don't forget that we had a great advantage in the field of Valderram; we also had a great advantage in the field of Brooklyn where we lost, and in the case of the field of Valderram we won only by the hair," Bjorn said, on the photo, after winning 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, which gave 10-6 to the field of Le Golf National.
Time will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
You're giving everything up tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything you can.
The end will only come when the points appear on the table.
We have a goal to win the trophy, and we need to focus on it.
From the beginning I said that I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know well who people are on the opposite side — the best players in the world."
Bjorn, fascinated by the hard work of his teammates, added: “I wouldn’t do better.
But tomorrow is something else.
They're starting a single tomorrow, and that's another question.
It's good to play with your partner when everything goes into mind, but when you play alone, your golf skills are tested to the limit of possibilities.
It's a message that you need to pass on to the players, and it's all you have to do tomorrow.
The partner also has to give everything to himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk will expect his competitors to achieve better results in a single match than in the game with his partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Sam Furyk experienced a great return to action on the last day, a member of the winning team in the Brooklyn field, after which he failed after the European team performed "a miracle on the Medina field".
"I remember every word," he said in his answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, was warming up to fight his competitors on the last day.
"Tomorrow we will play 12 important games – you would like to start the game at a fast pace, as was the case in the fields of Brooklyn and Medina.
If this floor goes one way, it's going to get a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We set our composition properly and set the boys in a way that would allow us to be charming tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to conduct the contract, with Rory McIlroy in the main match, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmo, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — other European team champions in the lead half of the program.
"I decided on this group of guys in this order, because I think he'll be able to handle all the games," Bjorn said about his choices on a single.
New German warship again late
The latest freight of the German Navy should be used in 2014 in order to replace the old warships of the winter, but this will not happen until at least next year due to poor systems and rising costs, as local media have said.
The use of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the master ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was moved to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, referring to the words of the military spokesman.
The ship should be included in the warship in 2014, but it was necessary to introduce changes to this ambitious project as a result of the problems that arose after delivery.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg units ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen fleets.
Of course, they will be equipped in a powerful piece, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-shipcraft bullets, as well as technological solutions to prevent detection, including reducing radar, sub-red and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer periods between conservations — the operation of new frigates should be possible even for two years from the mother’s ports.
The remaining delays, however, mean that these modern warships, which will enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be too old at the start of the service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the first page of the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to give up the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the harbor after delivery.
There was little information about the reasons behind the return, but the German media reported on a number of key software and equipment errors that made the ship useless in the war mission.
The software errors were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 mariners, half less than in the case of the older Bremen class.
It has also proved that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its achievement and limits the ability to carry out the warship of future modernisations.
It is considered that the 7000 tonnes of the Rhineland-Pfalz ship is twice as heavy as ships of the same class used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to poor equipment, the problem also becomes the cost of the whole project — including crew training.
It is said to have reached a level of EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion), while the initial cost was EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the use of new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings of the fact that the power of the German fleet is smoking.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence commission, admitted that sailors "end the ships capable of being used".
He also said that this problem had increased over time as a result of withdrawal from the operation of the old units without the provision of replacement vessels.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg fleets could be included in the Navy fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of a bat
The new surveys carried out in the area of the Highlands are designed to show how the landscapes are being used in the production of food.
Research results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these exceptional flying mammals and to help direct future actions to protect them.
The research carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will be carried out by small and poppy cartilages, as well as brown netopers with long ears and netopers from the Red Neck family in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special registries will be deployed in key locations around the holding to monitor the netoperium activity throughout the whole season.
NHS workers and volunteers will also conduct field studies using portable detectors.
The purpose of the expert sound analysis of all recordings is to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and the manner in which each species is treated.
The map and the report will then be developed to create a detailed image of their landscape behaviour.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Nature Protection Adviser, hopes that the results are public, which are the most important areas for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of work related to the management of habitats, e.g. the creation of ponds, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout Britain, the Netoper population has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which have an impact on the banks and the loss of buildings.
Wind turbines and lighting installations may also pose a threat, as well as beauties on flies and some chemical measures used in building materials and even domestic cats.
The bats aren't really that blind.
However, because of nightly fishing habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in the catch.
They use a complex echolocation technique to search for gears and obstacles on their way.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 residential buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, grid checks, and sometimes even rescue actions.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reserve of netopers dedicated in Scotland to the property of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of netopers.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says she's for the unopposed ideal territory.
"Threave has an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and great settlements.
However, there are still many unknowns when it comes to bats. The work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop."
It underlines the importance of monitoring the presence of netopers before entering into conservation work in holdings, as the accidental destruction of one dam may kill up to 400 females and young people, which may lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
The bats are protected — their killing, beating or stumbling, and the destruction of their nests is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a shocking officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged public opinion to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and in many species we don’t even know how their populations are doing. ”
Ronaldo rejects charges of violence, while his lawyers intend to invite German magazines
Cristiano Ronaldo identified charges of violence against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote", using his name.
His lawyers are going to invite the German intelligence magazine Der Spiegel, who published these charges.
The Portuguese attacker Juventus was accused of rape by an American woman, Kathryn Mayorg, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel's Friday report, a dancer was to pay a woman $375 000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years), a few hours after the announcement of the charges, in an instagram transmission to his 142 million followers, identified these reports as "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's reports are fake news," said the five-time winner of the gold ball.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous for my name, but it's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's all right," added the dancer with a smile on his mouth.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to invite the Der Spiegel magazine for proposals that called "an unacceptable declaration of suspicion in the area of privacy" – as Reuters says.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that a footballer would be required to be compensated for “moral damage in the amount of a violation which is likely to be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years”.
We said it was supposed to take place in June 2009 in the hotel room Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting Ronaldo and Mayorg at the nightclub, they also went to the ballroom, where he reportedly raped the woman anal — as evidenced by the documents in the district court of Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after a riverbed and told her that "99 percent is a good guy", which was visited by this "one percent".
According to the evidence, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was a mutual agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but later she agreed to a federal agreement, because she was "feared" and "public torture".
The 34-year-old says he wants to cancel the deal now, because he can still not forget the alleged departure.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this year he moved to Juventus after paying 100 million euros for him.
Brexit: Great Britain "would regret all the time" car manufacturers' departure
The Great Britain "would regret it all the time", if after leaving the European Union she lost world leader in car production, Minister of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that "he was concerned" when Toyota UK representative told the BBC in an interview that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, production in the factory in Burnaston near Derby will be temporarily stopped.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays at the border in the absence of agreement on Brexit could lead to job reductions.
The factory in Burnaston, which produces Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"I believe that if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without agreement, then production will be stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other British car manufacturers fear leaving the EU without agreement on how to operate cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW intends to close its mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern, as car manufacturers claim, the risks associated with the supply chain if the European Union leaves the UK without agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on the basis of "just-in-time", in which parts reach up to 37 minutes from suppliers both in Britain and in the EU in the case of cars produced on the order.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without agreement, it may experience difficulties on the border, which, according to the industry representative, may lead to delays and partial disadvantages.
As the company representative said, Toyota would not be able to last more than one day without delivery to her factory in Derbyshire, which would stop production.
Clark said the Chequers Theresy May plan on future EU relations is "exactly designed to avoid border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want to achieve the best of possible agreements, which will allow us not only to enjoy our current success, but also to make good use of this situation," said the BBC Radio 4 today.
"Not only Toyota's statements, but also other producers, show that we need to be able to continue what it was for a very efficient supply chain set."
Toyota’s representation was unable to determine how long production will be stopped, but warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the company, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the U.S. corporate council, said that the relationship is becoming increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if there is to be a liquidation of jobs, they will never be restored.
The Government's spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan of our future relations with the European Union".
Meeting Trump with Rosenstein can be delayed again as White House is administered
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "latest by next week" because of the ongoing fight against the candidate to the highest court of Brett Kavanaugh, as the White House gave on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who examines the possibility of interference by Russia in elections, the links between close collaborators Trump and Russia, and the potential impeding of justice actions by the President.
The fact that Trump is releasing the Deputy Attorney General, threatening the same independence of Mueller, has been a hot topic for the month in Washington.
At the beginning of this month's New York Times, Rosenstein spoke on the subject of holding a hearing to record talks with Trump, as well as on the possibility of removing the president from his position on the basis of Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
On Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports as if he were going to smoke.
The date of the meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, and there was a delay in the meeting to avoid colliding with the senate judicial commission, during which the testimony was filed by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday Trump managed a weekly FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's vote.
The Truppa presswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News station.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, and it may be moved for another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'm sure I'll inform the press."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The program leader, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences were not motivated by a lack of "centenarian" television journalists, and she added: "I will not hide that they are "centenarian".
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The President-in-Office conducts more "questions and answers" sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding without giving any evidence: "We've met with numbers."
The press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but “if journalists are able to direct the President of the United States, this is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this regularly, and in the last few weeks we have done it very often. Press conferences will end such sessions, during which we can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
The solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why it is, acting too freely and sometimes oddly in front of the assembled journalists.
Minister of Health writes to workers from the European Union employed in NHS Scotland in the face of concerns related to Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to workers from the European Union who were employed in the Scottish health service to express their gratitude to the country and to ask them not to leave for Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter for less than six months before leaving the European Union for Britain.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of examining applications for "setled status" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer negotiations on Britain’s departure from the European Union continued, and decisions will be taken in the fall of this year.
The British government has also intensified preparation for a possible outcome scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleges from all over the EU and beyond offer valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie is undergoing surgery as a result of a head injury
The shooting team Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, went through the operation as a result of a head injury on Saturday's match with Vanderbilt Commodores, who ended up defeating the Tennessee team with the result of 31-27, told Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, the top coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the racer had suffered an injury shortly before the end of the first half.
"He came to the side line, after which he landed on the ground," Reed said.
Medical trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line, then placed it on the nose and carried it out to carry out further studies.
The representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie was operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the nature/size of the wound yet", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the wound occurred.
Abercrombie (a second-year student who has been fired from the university's representation for a year to train her skills) plays her first season in Tennessee State team after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday before the match ended, he had five tears, which gave him 18 tears throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
In line with the new plans of tourists buying from abroad, there will be higher treasure fees for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom. The funds will thus be used to help the homeless.
This move is intended to undermine the success of Jeremy Corbyn's actions to attract a young electorate.
An increase in tax fees will cover persons who do not deduct taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury Ministry thus provides that it will earn up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May informs today that the foreign buyers in the United Kingdom will be charged a higher treasure fee and thus the additional funds will be provided to help the homeless.
This move is taken as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract a young electorate with the promises of cheaper apartments and increase the burden of more profitable people.
Higher taxes will be imposed on individuals and companies not taxing in the United Kingdom. Additional measures will help the government to fight homelessness.
An additional fee — which is charged in addition to the current tax, including two years ago higher rates for other houses and apartments purchased for rent — may amount to up to three percent.
The treasure of the state expects that this move will allow for up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price increases and hampering the purchase of the first house or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy property, and most of the time spends more than a country, many wealthy regions — and in particular the capital — have become “the city of spirits. ”
The new rules come only a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call for a reduced treasure fee to help young people buy the first house.
He accused major developers of maintaining high real estate prices by occupying the area, but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to remove the limits of cheap housing in order to eliminate the "dwelling scandal" in the United Kingdom.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including the regulation of jobs and the end of the "no reason" issue.
It also wants to grant local authorities greater powers in the construction of new homes.
Theresa May said: “I said last year that as a prime minister, I was engaged in rebuilding the British dream of a better life for every next generation than before.
This also means repairing our praised housing market.
The Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can easily buy real estate here as hard as British residents.
For too many people the dream of their own home has become very remote, so the humiliation of the need to sleep on the street remains real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to become a Scottish picker"
Coach Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "most ambition" is to be at some point a selectionist of Scotland.
This 40-year-old Scotland is working on the North-East Club's healing, which is currently taking third place in League One with a three-point loss in relation to the best team.
He moved to the Stage of Light that year after the last season he introduced the St Mirren Club back to the Scottish Premiership.
"I wanted to represent my country as a champion,
But I managed only to get to staff B," Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“As a child I often watched with the father of the Scottish game in Hampden and it always drew me.
However, such a possibility will come only if I take success as a club coach."
Among the former Ross in the position of Coach Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic says he doesn't feel like he's dead, taking the role of so-called personalities in such a big club, rejecting earlier proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"It will be always a success for me to see if I can bring this club back to Primer League.
Taking into account its structure and the amenities it has, there is no doubt where it is," he adds.
"It will not be easy to do this, but I certainly feel that I have succeeded here, only if I succeed."
Ross' coach career lasts only three years. Previously he was an assistant coach in Dumbarton and for 15 months belonged to the Hearts training team.
Next, Allo helped to reinstate after the third league was demolished, and in the next season, he led the St. Mirren team from the downhill to the championship.
Jack Ross says he now feels much more comfortable than when he played Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a real point of return," said coach Alloa.
"I really believed that driving a team would be much better for me than playing.
It's gonna be weird because as a champion, I've done my best and I've achieved a few huge successes.
But playing is a heavy piece of bread.
You have to get through different situations every week.
They still meet me when it comes to stress and stress related to coach work, but I feel good about this role.
I've always wanted to train others and now I'm doing it.
The entire interview at Sportsound can be heard on Sunday, September 30 in Scotland radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST time
Studies show that the best time for beer is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday.
The summer flood wave caused a violent flow of customers to British pubs, but it took a look at the restaurant's networks.
The studies showed that in July sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the consulting company CGA, who developed the data, says: “Earths fell and longer than expected in England in World Championships caused the results of July to be similar to June when the pub rotations increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that the profits of the restaurants dropped even more.
As recorded in June, 1.8 percent of the sales drop in restaurants in July has increased even more.
The drinking of pubs and bars was the best way to do it — their sales growth exceeded the decline recorded in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered during showers, although not so much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just being pushed.
The sale of drinks in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent this month, and food fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from RSM, who is involved in the analysis of the entertainment and tourism industry, says: “These results are reflected in the trend that we have observed since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the size of 'outside home' consumption remain weather and major sporting or social events.
The fact that restaurant networks survive difficult times, no wonder, although sales drop by 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year will have a particularly significant impact, given the constant pressure to reduce costs.
The long and intense summer has come at the least favorable moment for the owners of the food service and time will show whether a little more moderate temperatures that we had in August will bring such a need for inspiration."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting slowdown in brand development.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which is responsible for monitoring sales in pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds.
One per five children has a secret account in social media that they hide from their parents
Studies have shown that one per five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have a secret account on social networks that they hide from parents and teachers.
The survey carried out among 20,000 pupils of secondary schools showed an increase in the number of fake Insta pages
These reports raised concerns that the content of the articles is of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students have found that they have a "main" account showing their parents
One for five children — some under 11 years of age — has an account on social networks that does not reveal itself to adults.
The survey carried out among 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" — the name refers to the Instagram service where you can share photos.
These reports raised concerns that these accounts are used to publish content of a sexual nature.
Twenty per cent of students have admitted that they run a "main" threatened account, which shows their parents and also has a private account.
One of the mothers, who, by chance, came to the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, met a teenager who urged others to "violate her".
The study carried out in independent schools by the UK Digital Awareness Agency and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses Association (HMC) showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 are running two profiles. Half of them are admitted to maintaining private accounts.
HMC’s president, Mike Buchanan, says: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers create their own places on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them”.
Elid Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Board
During the annual general meeting of the Scottish Athletics Elid Doyle, he was elected to the Management Board as a non-executive director.
Elid Doyle is the most famous Scottish lightball player. President Ian Beattie has defined this move as an excellent opportunity for sports managers to benefit from her rich international experience she has gained in the last decade.
"Eilid enjoys a great respect for the Scottish, British and world light athletes and we are confident that its introduction to management will bring great benefits to the Scottish light airballs," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very happy that I will have the opportunity to convey the votes of the athletes to the council, and I hope that I will be able to really help manage sports in Scotland.”
The American, who is one of his four gold Olympic medals, won 200 and 400 metres in the Olympics in the Atlantic in 1996, and is now regularly held in the BBC as an expert, cannot go on as a result of a passing blood attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would show me whether I'd regain my ability and to what extent.
It was a Sunday job, but I totally recovered, I learned to walk again and I got back to practice!
Thank you for all the words of support!"
Advertising of lactators that compares mothers to cows stimulates extreme emotions on the Internet
The company producing lactators caused a storm on the Internet by publishing an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers to breast-feeding cows.
In order to announce the launch of the "first silent lactator in the world to wear clothes", its producer, Elvie, published a telescopic broadcast that highlights the freedom it provides to mothers.
She presents four real mothers dancing in the shade filled with the song, in which she hears the words: "Yes, I do, but I don't see the bells" and "If you don't notice, it's not just my tits."
Refren goes this way: “Spring them, pump them, feed them with children, pump them, pump them, and I will take care of my lord.”
The advertisement, which was published on the company's facebook page, caused major online controversy.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them claim that it is inappropriate to joke about the "horror" that takes place in the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to the body, because their children are taken away after a few days from birth," wrote one user.
Elvie lactator can be treated with bistonosis (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
Of course, let's use cows to advertise lactators for mothers who can stop their children."
Someone else added: "This advertisement is completely absorbed from reality."
Another weapon of the clip — one of the women found the song to be “beautiful. ”
"I think it's a great idea.
If I'm still breast-feeding, I'd buy myself that way.
I felt like a cow when I took off my food.
Advertising's a little crazy, but I'm not trying on her second floor.
It's a brilliant finding" - someone wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun advertisement directed to mothers who pull food (often at work or toilet) and feel like 'bloods'.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, it turns out that women danced with lactators discreetly attached to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many feeding women felt like cows.
However, the Lactator Elvie is completely quiet, there are no cables or pipes and can be carried under undetected bistonosis to feeding, which gives women the freedom to move, hold children on their hands, and even leave the house while taking away the food.
Ana Balarin, a creative partner and director at Mother, said: “Laktor Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a brave and provocative premiere.
By putting together nourishing women and milk cows, we wanted to show all the challenges associated with the withdrawal of food, presenting together in a fun and consistent way the incredible feeling of freedom that he provides.
This isn't the first time that lactator Elvie hit the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week during the exhibition Marty Jakubowski appeared the mother of two children with this product attached.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been secretly transferred to the rental camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained in immigration is increasing sharply, although the number of persons crossing the border does not change every month. This is partly due to the harsh rhetoric and the principles introduced by President Trump's administration made it difficult to place children in sponsors.
Most of the sponsors are also non-documented immigrants who are afraid of exposure to deportation if they report after a child.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the fingerprints will be collected from potential sponsors and other adult residents in the common economy, which will then be transmitted to the immigration office.
Last week, the senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, Matthew Albence, testified before the Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who reported to be sponsors for children left without care.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been previously recorded.
“There are not 80 per cent of the people who are sponsors or reside with them in one domestic holding who are illegally resident in the country, and most of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That's why we keep chasing them," said Albence.
Protective workers say that in efforts to speed up the regulation of the situation of children, officials introduced new rules that require a part of them to appear in court within a month of detention — not after 60 days, as was the case with previous standards.
Much will be done through the videoconferencing, not personally, to ask the immigration judge to legalise their status.
Those who do not qualify for exemption will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in detention, the easier they can become uneasy or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of aggression or attempts to flee.
Defenders have found that these problems are even more serious in larger centres, such as Tornillo, where it is easier to see signs that something bad is happening with the child.
They also added that moving children to the rental camp without providing them with the right time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already coping with.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
During his address to the UN General Assembly, Syria's Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moual, also called on refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in that country has lasted for eight years.
The Moule, which also plays the role of the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally staying in the Syrian land, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "we will deal with them accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he announced to the Assembly.
Moual states that "war on terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360 thousand people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to “run its holy battle until the Syrian territory is cleared” from both terrorist groups and from “all foreigners who are illegally residing in it”.
Currently, there are about 2,000 American soldiers in Syria who are mainly trained by the Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad and advised them.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the country of the war destroyed.
With regard to refugees, Moual found that conditions were good enough for them to return, and he accused "some countries in the west" of "exciting unreasonable fear", which would discourage them from returning.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations for help in these returns," he said.
"They're policing things that should have a purely human dimension."
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad joins the opposition to the political agreement to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid.
The United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel base in Idlib has made it possible to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has helped to prevent a major Syrian attack supported by Russia on the province in which three million people live.
Moual, however, stressed that the agreement had a "clear time frame", and expressed hope that military action would be measured in the jihadist, including fighters associated with the Al-Qaeda People's Defence Front, who would be "destroyed".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to call soon for the first meeting of a new commission composed of the governing party and the opposition to develop a sketch of the Syrian military constitution and prepare for the elections.
Mouale set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the commission, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "to verify the records of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump wins the election again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected second in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers hope, his presidency would soon end by removing it from office and scandal.
It would certainly be "the most dramatic final of the presidency so far".
There's no sign of fatigue at the moment.
Since 2014, the results of CNN channel visibility in the first three years have doubled and reached 1.05 million views, and the MSNBC channel has nearly tripled to 1.6 million views.
According to Nielsen Fox News, it attracts an average of 2.4 million viewing hours, which is an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program has achieved the highest results among cable television, attracting up to 3.5 million viewing evening information programs.
"People fly like we go to the fire -- that's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, the lead producer of the ABC series "Designed Survivor" as the secretary of the office, who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy artist and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snaging Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
It mentions how she was driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager said he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he mocks me," he replied.
Chaos has fun value.
Of course, reports from Washington could, like anything else shown on TV, judge the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the admissibility of the association of immigrant families or the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged visions.
Besides, this is not just about being a well-informed citizen when you look at a six-hour panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of secret informants while writing the book "Fear", about Paul Manafort's shirt from the leather of the pot for $15,000 (the "loaded dog clothes", as The Washington Post) or about the implications of the shocking descriptions of President Trump's anatomy details published by Storm Daniels.
I'll never look at Super Mario like I used to.
"What he does is partly to remind the reality of the show in that every evening he supplies new content," said Brent Montgomery, Director General Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of the "Pawn Stars" about the changing volume and the daily return of the Trump show (as an attack on the NFL league winners or the praise of Kim Dzong Una).
You can't afford to miss a piece of paper because you're gonna have a problem.
When I met Mike Flesm this week, the weather on the northern coast of the Kauai island, where he has his home, was beautiful, but he was sitting in the middle looking at MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't stand it, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Court Commission and considered the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right."

Cash flow from outside to election campaign to Congress
It is not surprising that after the reorganisation of the electoral districts, which will result in the race for one position now being held by two current congressmen, to the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania, the cash flow flows.
This recently created Pittsburgh district represents a representative of the Democrats, Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district in Pennsylvania, which is largely covered with the 17th district.
The maps of the districts were corrected after the January judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled that the old districts were not fair, which gave priority to the Republics and was incompatible with the Constitution.
The race in the new district 17 began with the fight to finance the campaign between the party’s main funding bodies — the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The Lamb's name won popularity in Pennsylvania after winning hair in a wide-ranging election to the 18th round of the election that took place in March.
The Republican has been in this position for more than a decade, and Donald Trump has won 20 points in this district.
Political experts gave the Democrats a minor advantage.
The United States considered Salwador's punishment for supporting China, but withdrew from this idea.
The diplomats noticed that Dominicans and Panama have already recognized Beijing, despite a slight opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a warm meeting with President Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and until the departure of the Trump Organization team's partners, he had a hotel in Panama.
The officials of the State Department decided to revoke the heads of the American diplomatic missions from Salwador, Dominicans and Panama due to "the recent decisions to end Taiwan's recognition", according to Heather Nauert, a spokesman for this month's statement.
However, the sanctions under consideration were to be imposed only on Salwador, who was estimated to have received $140 million from the United States in 2017 to help fight drugs and support for development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which were intended to limit financial aid and grant visas to certain persons, would be very relevant to this Central American country, which is struggling with a large unemployment rate and a high murder rate.
In the light of the progress made in international meetings, North and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference, which was intended to address security and economic well-being, in order to address the requests of a similar meeting from last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from being submitted to the United States.
In mid-September, the top-level administrations made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus doing all the consideration of sanctions against Salwador.
The diplomats say that at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, there will be Vice-President Mike Pence, which is to be a sign of the invitation to the meeting of the representatives of the administration.
The three American envoys returned quietly to Salwador, Panama and Dominicans, which did not include any new severe communications or punishments from Washington.
John Bolton's spokesman for the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on anonymity.
Their relations were confirmed by an external analyst from the administration environment, who also said anonymously.
Learn History
Another element may be the Special Prosecutor's report, Robert Mueller, on the possible impediment to the justice actions of President Trump, which is now available to the public.
According to reports, Robert Mueller's investigation also examined whether Donald Trump's campaign had anything to do with Russia's attack on the American elections.
If it changes the composition of Congress, President Trump will be held accountable by him during preparations for re-election before the election, and perhaps even before the jury.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump — or people in his position in Europe — is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which decides how long it can take.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to take action against Hitler if only the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
It didn't work out, and we lost the chance to avoid the crop years that followed.
History circles turn around such points, speeding up or slowing down the inevitable course of democracy.
There are now several such points in front of the Americans.
What would we do if Donald Trump was released from Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man whose future depends on Robert Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since we found out in our paper that last year he proposed a secret recording of the president and speculated that he wasn't looking for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by The Times is inaccurate.
“How do we react if the newly ordered FBI investigation into Bretta Kavanaugh is incomplete or unjust or if it is appointed to the Judge of the Supreme Court despite the credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we in half of our presidential term choose the person who will bring Donald Trump to the convention?
If we don't pass those tests, there will be hard times for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed — because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over my residence as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to burn the sabbatical lights on that table marked with a swastika.
Having such an inheritance, how can I not look at the future optimisticly?"

Winner of the Rangers Club, Graham Dorrans, with optimism waiting for the match with the Rapid Vienna team
The Rangers take up Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the awareness that winning with Austria, after the impressive Villareal remission achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chance to qualify from the G League of Europe.
Until 2:2 of Villareal's collision the knee prevented the assistant Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes that this result works on Rangers as a trampoline for greater success.
"It did us good because Villarreal is in good shape," said 31-year-old.
“We went to this game with the faith that we will achieve something – and we fought the point.
Maybe we could still push them, but generally the remix is probably a fair result.
Spain was probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second half.
As far as Thursday is concerned, this is another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we will get three points, but this game will be difficult, because our opponent has won a good outcome in his last match. However, I am sure that thanks to the support of the kibians, we will pass and that we will win a positive outcome.
Last year, it was really hard because of all my contusions and changes in the club itself, but now we all feel good in our places.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we'll be able to move on, leave the last season behind and bring success."
The fear of pension savings sleeps women out of sleep
Although the pollers knew exactly how they wanted to take care of them, they had little discussion with the family.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants found that she had talked to her partner about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
"People want them to take care of family members, but they don't take care of this topic," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Insurance Company.
From what?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to take care of yourself if you do not speak your mind beforehand.
Talk to your counselor and family where and how you want to take care of yourself, because this choice will be an important factor in determining the costs.
Ask for help from a financial adviser: He can help find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds may come from a traditional police officer to such a hybrid police officer that allows you to pay cash to cover such expenses, or from your own property, as much as you have.
Prepare legal documents: You will avoid these court battles.
The designation of a trusted health care agent who will monitor it and ensure that the persons concerned act in accordance with your will if the communication becomes impossible.
Consider, too, the employment of a full-time employee who will be involved in finance.
Choose a trusted person because she will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all accounts are paid if you are unable to do so on your own.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your parents in their old age suddenly need medical help and they’re just going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Print all the information to be prepared.
"This is not just about finances, but about who the doctors are," Martin asks.
“What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It's worth having such a plan under your hand."
Man repeatedly shot from a windmill in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times by the wind when he returned home from the evening party.
The 40th kilometer was located in the area of Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, in Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, belly and arm.
The police identified the shootings that took place around 02:30 BST time as "accidental action".
The victim didn't see a rapist.
The injuries committed do not endanger the life of a man, and the police are asking to report the witnesses to the incident.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunamis that visited the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
No information from the Dongal cabupatene, which is located north of Pala, was obtained due to the collapse of the rescuers' communication, near the Earthquake epicentre of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala after the disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and the Cabupatje Dongal on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes, a province located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island. According to estimates in 2017, there were 379 800 people.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city’s 40th anniversary’s trade lasted.
This was done by Kabupatene (administrative unit at a level below the province) extending along the north-west coast of the island over 300 km long.
It is estimated that in 2017 it was inhabited by 299,200 people.
The main branches of the Central Celebrates economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed especially on the coast of the Dongal Cabbage.
Another source of income of the province is the mine of nickel, but it is mainly located in Morovala, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to information from the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, over the last 100 years earthquakes and tsunamis have visited Palu and Dattala several times.
In 1938, the tsunamis that hit Dokhala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of the tsunamis in west Donkali.
Indonesia is on the active Pacific ring of fire, which causes earthquakes to occur on a regular basis.
The biggest earthquakes in recent years:
2004: The great earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, making it more than half in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, the western coast of Sumatra visited a series of strong earthquakes.
On the island of Nias, hundreds of people were killed by the Sumatran coast.
2006: In the south of Java, Indonesia’s most isolated island, an earthquake of 6,8 degrees was triggered by tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: Not far from the village of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra, was the earthquake of 7.6 degrees.
More than 1,100 people died as a result.

The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested under domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidates for Vice-President, Sir Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, from Wasilla in Alaska, 29 years of age, he was arrested with domestic violence, difficulties in making the notification and the opposition against arrest.
According to the police report, when the suspect's friends tried to call the police to report a crime, she took her phone.
The KTUU station reports that Palin is in custody following Mat-Su and has a designated deposit of $500.
According to her report last Saturday, she stood before the court, where in her defense speech she said she was “innocent”.
There are three Class A violations in the Fire, which means he can be punished even in the year of the prison and $250,000.
He was also accused of exceeding Class B, for which he threatened the punishment of the day of imprisonment and fines of $200.
This is not the first time that Palina's charges are filed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is now before the Alaskan Veterans Court of Claims.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of hindering the filing of the report and of holding weapons in a state of impermeability due to this incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticised Sarah Palin, who linked aggressive behavior of her son to a purasive stress team that she had acquired during her service in Iraq.

The earthquake took place near the central part of the island of Celebes, located on the north east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
In social media, films are being filmed showing a time of disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people were on the beach in Paul’s place of the festival.
Federal prosecutors demand the death penalty for the suspected terrorist attack in New York
The New York federal prosecutors demand the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York, resulting in the death of eight people. This is a rare punishment — it has not been committed in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out the attack, which took place in October on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, the thirty-year-old Saipov reportedly used the rented Home Depot truck, which scattered pedestrians and bikers on his way.
In line with the New York South District's announcement of the intention to require the death penalty to justify its need, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "targetly" killed eight victims and "targetly" caused serious injury to the body.
According to the court's report, both of these charges threatens the death penalty.
Several weeks after the federal court's attack, Saipov filed a indictment involving 22 positions, including eight counts of murder in illegal activities, which is the procedure normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and the threat of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the organization of the attack required "solid planning and thinking". The way Saipov conducted it was defined as "refugeful, cruel and immoral".
"Sayfully Habibullaevic Saipov has brought harm, harm and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca" – a notice of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentina's citizens who stayed in New York touristically.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in the South New York District ten years ago.
The accused Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but finally in September 2009 he heard the verdict.
The death penalty as a result of the federal case was last committed in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenbergach. Marriage was lost after two years before they were convicted of conspiracy and espousals against the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were lost on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov's court documents, which comes from Uzbekistan, he did not show any convictions during the month following the attack.
The police say he told the investigator he was feeling good about what he did.
According to Saipov's indictment, he told the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS films he watched on the phone before the attack.
According to the police, the ISIS flag was also required to be suspended in his hospital.
In the case of a charge involving 22 charges, he's guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders of the Saipov government, said they were "depressed for obvious reasons" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and the rejection of life without the possibility of early release from the blame will only prolong the suffering that these events caused to all the persons concerned," he said.
Saipov's defence team asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
A tourist parliamentarian says NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
During today's protest, which took place during the tourist conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people".
Former leader of the UKI Party of Independence (UKIP) said politicians must "feel hot" from Eurosceptics when one of the parliamentarians suggested that Theresa May should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
A Conservative MP, Peter Bone, told demonstrators in Birmingham that if Farage was the secretary of Brexit, "the United Kingdom would already be outside the Union".
However, the association of the tourists who chose to remain in the Community to a separate protest against Brexit, which took place in the city, further stressed the weight of the commitment of its deep-divided series, which stood before Theresa May.
Your Prime Minister is trying hard to implement his compromise plan with Chequers among the Brexit supporters, its opponents, and the European Union itself.
Her allies say that despite the opposition, she will seek to conclude an agreement with Brussels and the Eurosceptics and Labourers to make a choice between her proposal and "chaos".
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave Assembly in Solihull that he wanted to "exploit the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be a full-fledged member, who should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were to do so, now we would be outside the Union," he said.
A member of Wellingborough added, "I support Brexit, but we have to throw out the Chequers plan."
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in World Wars to put someone under.
We want to establish our rights in our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that the citizens had changed their opinion since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and want to remain in the Union is completely false".
At the demonstration, Brexit Andrea Jenkyns, from the tourist party, said to the reporters: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, please listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not happy with the general support, the opposition will not vote on it, our party or our activists, who drive the streets and choose us, and they don't support it.
Please drop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a statement addressed to Prime Minister May, she added: "The Premiers keep their positions when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said that politicians taking part in the demonstration must "be hot" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a matter of trust between us — people — and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you do it'."
Referring to the disillusioned crowd, he added: “I want you to make politicians on the edge of Brexit’s betrayal feel hot.
"We mobilize the army of the people of this country, which has given us victory in the referendum on Brexit, and we will not stop until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
At that time, Brexit’s opponents massed through the city to the center where a two-hour demonstration took place.
The activist's Garstka went off with the banners "Torysi v. Brexit" after the group was set up this weekend.
Labourer activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, was curing conservatives for security issues at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who claim that they can organize computer systems and all technology to support the Canada Plus Plan, a liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There's nothing like good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to "consider seriously" candidate for president
American Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after November's elections "he will seriously consider candidate for president".
According to The Boston Globe, a representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about her future when meeting with the elections that took place on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticises President Donald Trump, will apply for reelection in November. Her opponent will be Republican representative, Geoff Diehl, who was co-president of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 elections.
It is now said that Warren can defeat Trump in the 2020 elections.
The Saturday event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters in the town hall formula since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for the president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington to repair our own government — and also to have a woman on top.”
Arresting the death penalty officer in which the LSU player, Wayde Sims, died
The police from Baton Rouge state in Louisiana informed on Saturday of the arrest of a suspect on Friday shooting, where a basketball player from the LSU, Wade Sims, died.
The Baton Rouge police department informed of the arrest of 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson at a conference that took place at 11:00 Eastern Time.
On Friday, a shot was published with a request for help in identifying the male.
Twenty-two-year-old Wayde Sims died as a result of a shooting near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot with firearms in his head, resulting in his death," said Murphy J. Paul through police chief, according to the 247sports service.
Wayde stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at a crime scene, with a gun and shot at Wayde.
After he was arrested, he was arrested by the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A 1.98 m. Junior Wayde Sims was raised in Baton Rouge. He played 32 matches, during which last season he started 10 times, during which he spent on the park on average 17.4 minutes, won 5.6 points and counted 2.9 collections for the match.
Grand Prix Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after the team's command enabled him to win with Sebastian Vettel
Since the time that Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the Mercedes team's command will have a major impact on the outcome of the race.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and nearly beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two circles and forcing Vettel to attack his colleague from the team.
Vettel went to the service point as the first one and allowed Hamilton to ride in the pellet area, which should be decided on race tracks.
The Mercedes racer went into the box next round and appeared behind Vettel, but after the action around, as a result of which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner part of the track, risking the push to the defensive after a double-moved race to defend the position on the third round, Hamilton moved to drive.
Max Verstappen started at the end of the stake and at the end of his 21st birthday, at the end of the first round, he was in the seventh place.
He then ran through much of the race because he did not change the tire in order to complete the fast finish and take over Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he went to the service point at the 44th round, but in the other eight rounds he could no longer speed up, and the fourth place took Raikkonen.
“It was a difficult day because all weekend Valtteri did a great job and turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me go.
The whole team gave everything to take the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
At a meeting that took place on Saturday, President Donald Trump met with Senator Diana Feinstein, who maintained that she did not disclose the contents of the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which she accused the Judge of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to the statements made by Christina Ford before the Justice Senate Commission, but said that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "slow, evil and lying".
"What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate that we have witnessed for a few days when we see anger when we see people who are angry, angry, angry, and lying," he said.
"We see what has been published and revealed, and then they tell us 'oh, I didn't do it'.
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document? — oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Wait, wait.
Did we reveal... No, we didn't reveal," he added, undermining the senator.
Diana Feinstein received a letter from Christine Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and her contents ran out at the beginning of September.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's insinuation, I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein told the commission how The Hill brings it.
"She asked me to be discriminating, and I did not disclose these contents in accordance with her request."
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented: “I’m telling you, it was really an evil speech.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst language I've ever seen in my life."
By continuing to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, whose three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats use insinuations for their own purposes.
‘They are determined to take over all measures.
You see, wickedness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take over authority and control," said the president, according to the Mediaite service report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In the match with Dundee Patrick Dwyer got two goals for the Giants team
The Dundee Stars Club has rested on its Friday game in the Elite League with the Belfast Giants team, winning a round game on Saturday at 5:3.
The giants quickly gained a double advantage after Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer were shot.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownne scored, after which Dwyer again took the Giants to lead.
Francois Bouchard reassessed the score by winning the goal for the Dundee team, after which two gates shot by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen marked her victory.
It was the third lost in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's undershepherds, who won the Dundee team in Belfast on Friday night.
Both teams met in this season for the fourth time — the first three matches won by the Giants.
The opening goal of Dwyer fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFaull's assistant. Four minutes later Beauvilleer doubled the result thanks to David Rutherford's assistant.

Air traffic controller dies helping hundreds of people on the plane to escape from the earthquake
The air traffic controller from Indonesia was called a hero after he died, helping to safely launch a plane with hundreds of people aboard.
Over 800 people died, and many were considered missing after a great earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, causing tsunamis.
In the region there are still sensitive strong secondary shocks. In the city of Paul many people have been imprisoned in the mines.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his position in the scattered flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pal.
He was there to ensure that the Batik Air flight (pilot number 6321), which was just on the starting line, was safely launched.
Then he jumped out of the tower when it seemed to him that they were getting away.
He died in a hospital.
According to the Australian ABC News station spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the control decision probably saved hundreds of people's lives.
We organized a helicopter from Balikpapan to Borneo to move him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, Antonius left this morning before he got to Paul.
"This message broke our heart," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths can reach thousands. The national disaster relief agency informs that the possibility of access to the city of Dongall, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We believe that the harvest of death continues to increase, because many bodies are still under the bushes and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Six - foot - long [6 m] waves destroyed Paul, where the mass burial of the victims will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian planes provide help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News station: “The ambulants will constantly import bodies.
She's starting to miss drinking water.
Small shops are loaded."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is coming to the rescue, but we don’t know what we’re going to stand for.
It's already a tragedy, and it might be even worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, approached the army, saying: “All of you, please, work day and night to perform all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
This year, Indonesia has already seen the earthquake that killed over 550 people on the island of Lombok.
The plane crash in Micronesia — Air Niugini lines indicate that one person is missing after the plane crashed on the lagoon
The airline operating flights, which broke into a boat in Micronesia in the Pacific, informs that one person is missing. They previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the flying plane.
Air Niugini reported that according to the data on Saturday afternoons, one man could not be counted who traveled by feral aircraft.
They made sure that they and the local authorities, hospitals, and investigators were trying to find him.
However, they did not respond immediately to requests for additional details concerning passengers, such as their age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water while trying to land on Chuuk Island, local ships helped save the rest of the passengers and crew.
The officials informed on Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airlines said there were six passengers left on Saturday at the hospital, all in stable condition.
It is not clear what was the cause of the disaster, and we are also unaware of its exact course.
The United States Airline and the United States Navy claim that the plane landed on the lagoon not far from the start-up pass.
According to some witnesses, he fell out of the dog.
American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was coming very low.
"That helped us a lot," he said.
Jaynes said he and other people managed to get through the passing dog water to get out of an emergency flying plane.
According to him, board personnel panicked and yelled, and he himself suffered a terrible head injury.
The U.S. Navy military reported that in the rescue, the mariners who were working nearby on the modernization of the coast also helped to move people to the shore by means of a steaming boat before the plane sank to about 30 meters deep.
According to the Aviation Safety Network database, 111 people have died in the last two decades in the disasters of aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea. However, Air Niugini does not exist.
The analyst reconstructed night events when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor concluded the presentation of evidence in the retrial of the male accused of burning alive women in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, has spent many hours testifying as a court in the field of information analysis.
He described to the judges how with cell phone records he replayed the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
As reported by the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he had obtained location data from various cell phones that showed that Feral Night Tellis was from Chambers.
When they confirmed that at the time when Quinton was supposed to be with his friends, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interrogate Sanford.
On Saturday Sanford said he wasn't in town that day.
To the prosecutors' question about whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he replied that "he was lying, because my truck was then in Nashville."
Another insanity is Tellis that he's known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis he removed her contact data from the phone, as well as text messages and connections.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The final defense is due to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that the case would probably be handed over to the jury on the same day.

Another black?
Nania from New York invited a couple for release after "racist" SMS
Nania from New York invites a couple to leave her work on racist grounds after receiving a misdirected text, in which the mother of the child complains that she is a "other black person".
The couple objected, as if they were racists, comparing the poem to "santage".
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly concentrated when it turned out that a new caregiver, Giselle Maurice, who had just arrived at the first day of work in 2016, was a blacksmith.
“NOEEE, KEY black person”, she wrote to her husband in her text.
But instead of sending it to him, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post newspaper, when Plasco-Flaxman realized that he was a full-fledged gaff, she released Giselle Maurice, claiming that the hearty ninja, which is African-American, was wrong to carry out her duties, and she was also expecting ninja from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice received a day's pay and was then sent to Uber's house.
Now, the compensation is claimed from a couple for the exemption of $350 per day multiplied by six months, on which she was initially employed with her residence, although she did not sign the contract.
"I want to show them that such things are not done," said the Post newspaper on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the charges of racism, claiming that the conclusion of their cooperation with Maurice was justified because, as they imagined it, they feared that they would not be able to trust it.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t intend to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco said to the Postman.
"Would you believe your children to whom you have committed adultery, even if it happened through a mistake?
Your new-born child?
Come on."
Compared to "santating", Plasco said that his wife was born only two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you intend to blow up something like that?
It's not too nice," added the investment banker.
Although the case has not yet been brought before the Court, the public opinion quickly issued a ruling in social media, criticizing it for its behaviour and way of thinking.
The new letter reveals that the editors of the books about Paddington were afraid that readers would not feel bound to the talking mission.
The author’s daughter Michael Bonda, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s warm reception, says: “It’s hard to find the person who read it for the first time before the book was published.
It's very funny now that we already know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
She claims that her father, who, before a small plush mouse inspired him to write a book for children, worked as a cameraman at BBC, was sure to be rejected. She also adds that after his death last year in the 60th year of publishing the book, he seems to be "sweet-lucky".
Paddington, described as "a very important member of our family", says her father was in secret proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, he didn't fight," he adds.
“But because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something — you feel proud of him, though it is not your merit.
I think the success of Paddington has been seen in less than that way.
Although he himself invented it and created it, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter was landed, she was transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life for free.
"Now he called regularly and said it's really bad that he probably won't get out of it," says Tanya Ednan-Laperous.
“Then he called to say that Natasha was going to die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be home soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart action slowly stopped working and were removed from the body.
She died a while ago, and that was the end of it all.
I could just sit down and wait and realize that all of this is developing.
I couldn't go out or cry or cry because I was among other people.
I really had to hold on."
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperous, who was already mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded with other passengers, unaware of the pain she was suffering.
"No one knew," she said.
I had my head down, and my tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt all-encompassing compassion for Nada.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's grief mails are supposed to help prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women, whose loved ones committed suicide, try to take others away from taking life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are stationed on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers under which people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he was suffering from depression.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," he says.
45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, tells us that her son was a well-predicted chef with an amazing smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
They always said they could explain every room."
However, before his death, he gave up his job because he was “in a very black place. ”
In 2014, Brother Tyler was 11 years old and that's what he found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always afraid of the effect of domination."
Sharon Davis created the cards “to tell people that there are people to whom you can turn and to whom you can talk, even if only you know them.
Don't sit still, talk to somebody."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, soon after her mother died, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years.
"Nothing said that he felt upset, sad or something," he says.
“A few days before the birth of God, we observed a change in his behaviour.
He was already in the perfect doll when the kids opened the presents, even looking at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with her: “It is a family hole.
It's distracting us.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on Italy because the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought that if we could really get what we asked for - a limited investigation time and a limited amount - maybe we could achieve some unanimity," Jeff Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the Commission would "disappear" on the opposing camps that lead to the impact.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican voters want an FBI investigation?
All their desire comes from time to time.
The elections to the Congress are held in just a few weeks — November 6, if, according to forecasts, the Republic loses its chances of selecting a particular person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has already raised a listener to call the senators and to appeal to the support of Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of the president.
What happens when the FBI prepares a report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not certain whether Brett Kavanaugh will obtain at least 50 senators' votes, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the impasse and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under the governments of Kima, the number of refugees from North Korea is small
According to South Korean legislator Kim Dzong Un, since seven years ago, the number of people fleeing North Korea has fallen to South Korea.
In quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of the Union, Park Byeong-seug said 1127 flights were recorded last year, and in 2011 – 2706.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more detailed border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by human smugglers.
Pjongang did not issue a public statement on this matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally proposed for South Korea citizenship.
According to the authorities in Seoul since the end of the Korean war in 1953, the border had been illegally exceeded by more than 30,000 Koreans from the North.
Most of the Chinese who have the longest border with North Korea flee, making it easier to cross than a strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between both Koreas.
The Chinese consider refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often send them back to the country.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is theoretically still in war, has clearly improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang, where talks were held on the negotiations on denuclearisation, which had previously been in the deadlock.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Dzong Un, which took place in June in Singapore.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of lack of progress on this issue.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security and in these circumstances there is no way that we can unilaterally defend ourselves as the first," Ri said in a speech that he spoke before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavanaugh "the hysterical" and claims that he is not allowed to work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Bretta Kavanaugh "history" and said that he was not naturally able to work in the Supreme Court.
Peloso delivered those words during the interview she gave on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think that if a woman acted in this way, she would be considered a 'sister'," Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony that Kavanaugh presented on Thursday before the Justice Senate Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally opposed the charges of alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At times during his opening speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — he almost screamed and lost his speech when he talked about family matters and high school years.
He also made a clear distinction between the Democrats and the commission, setting out the charges against him, "the grotesque and coordinated threat of reputation" organised by the Liberals, who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelos said that according to her testimony, Kavanaugha showed that he was not allowed to work in the Supreme Court because it revealed his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think that he himself has been disqualified by issuing these statements, as well as by the way he attacked Clintons and Democrats," she said.
She was asked if she would try to withdraw Kavanaugh from the office if he received his nomination and if the Democrats had won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"I say so: if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also act in this court where he is currently working," she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Columbia.
Pelos added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible rulings of the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the corroborating case, Kavanaugh ignored questions as to whether he would have violated some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to bring a Historic Court, a person who will expect us to say 'although it is wonderful'," Pelosi added.
And women have to own it.
It's a decent diet, months, and years of raging anger, and she can't throw it away without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
"It's quite common, isn't it?"
She added: “A woman who was the manager of a company helped me greatly. She said that she also cried when she was angry, but she thought that when she was upset and started crying, she would talk to the person she was talking to, ‘You sure think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm mad.
He's still doing his own thing.
I thought it was great."
The lips are acceptable as an entry of anger for parts because they are in fact misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories of one of the first men - dominated men in the office is how one time I started crying out of unresolved anger. An older woman, a cold driver, always a bit afraid, then caught me by the neck and led me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy to see you."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a Member of Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat named Monkey Business and he retired from the race, frustrated at Patricia's borders, she realized that she could actually consider the idea of a self-sponsored candidate for the president.
"It was not a thoughtless decision," she said, laughing 30 years later.
“The elections were already held by seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone has identified this situation as the Queen Snow and Seven Magnificents."
As the campaign has been going on for a long time, Schroeder has been able to raise funds and has promised he won't join the race if he doesn't get $2 million.
It was a battle to lose.
She then discovered that some of her supporters who gave the man $1,000 had only 250 for her.
"Do they think I have any discounts?" she wondered.
During the talk, which announced that she would not be conducting a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotion — gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration for the system, which made it so difficult to collect money and turn to the voters, not the delegates, and angered at sexism — that the voice caught her in the throat.
"You might think I've gone through a nervous breakdown," he recalls the press's reactions.
"You might think that he's sponsoring me, Kleinex.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tomb.
"She cried?"
What benefits can the economic war between the United States and China bring to Beijing?
The economic wars between the United States and China have been palpable and, although the battle is still ongoing, in the longer term, the conflict between these countries can be beneficial to Beijing — experts say.
The first warning was fired this year by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, imposing duties on China's key export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week following the introduction of new tariff rates for goods worth $200 billion (150 billion) which resulted in the tax of half of all goods coming to the United States of China.
Every time, Beijing reciprocated in nature, lastly raising taxes on American goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
The Chinese are determined to respond to any US impact and it does not seem that the other economy in the world will soon end.
The forced withdrawal of Washington means acceptance of the demands, but the public neglect of the United States would be too overwhelming for President Chin, Xi Jinping.
According to experts, however, if Beijing were to play its cards well, the pressure resulting from the US trade war could in the long term strengthen China by reducing the dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that the rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the spread of economic chaos in some country is actually much more dangerous than the observers have so far granted," said Abigail Grace, a researcher in Asia in the thought tank Center for New American Security.
According to the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, "prepared" to return refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready for a voluntary return of refugees, and asks for assistance in rebuilding a country destroyed by more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Valid al-Moual, stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation in our area is now more stable and safe because of the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
In an effort to restore normality, the government is rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists all the time.
All conditions have already been met so that refugees who have to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic movements measured in their daily lives and their maintenance measures can return to it voluntarily.
According to the United Nations estimates, Syria has left more than 5.5 million citizens since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mouale said the Syrian regime would gladly accept help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept the aid granted under the conditions laid down or offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe threatens to win the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018, winning the US team from 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
In the European soil, the United States has already lost six of its ranks and since 1993 has not won the Ryder Cup Cup in Europe.
Europe recovered the trophy when, under the leadership of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it won 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who was not well for most of the tournaments, hit a ball from the base directly to the water at 16th floor of PAR3, giving the same match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined through all rounds and became one of four players who since 1979, when this tournament was first held in the current format, managed to achieve the result 5-0-0.
American Jordan Speeth was eliminated by 5&4 by the lowest ranking player from Europe, Thorbjorna Olesena from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the highest position in the world ranking, lost two dolls before the last doll with England's Ian Poulter, for which it might have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
Hispan Sergio Garcia, a European with the highest number of winnings in Ryder Cup, has already taken part in eight of these tournaments and has won 25.5 points in his career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t stop today.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I'm so happy to get back to the oven.
It is the success of the whole team and I am pleased that I could help," said the excited Garcia after the victory of the team from Europe.
He gives the stick to his cousin, John Rahmo, who won a single American golf legend on Sunday, Tiger Woods, the result of 2&1.
"I feel the incredible pride of the winner of Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all the matches in France and now has results 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
It's unmatched statistics, like one of the biggest players of all time, who got 14 most important titles and stopped only Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had a lot of trouble finding the current all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing appearance of his American captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I am proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point in the morning, we pushed a few Europeans.
We're out of here.
Head drops before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Commission, Ryder Cup, we will find a way forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of excitement for the opponents.
They played a lot better than us."
