At the end of the trade, the Prague Bascula Stock Exchange in the Negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ actions reach almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the trades, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed with the fall of the watch, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall of the actions on Wall Street.
The response of the market to the result of the vote of the House of American Representatives, who refused to adopt the plan for the stabilization of the American financial sector, is also discernible in us.
Shoves of actions in Asia
Asian scholarships run a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even if the indexes succeed in destroying part of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index of Hong Kong's stock exchange lost four percent during the trades, but later it eliminated part of the losses and reduced the decrease to almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Index Enterprises following the move of the Chinese shares of Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8%, the markets being closed in Shanghai.
Sydney's stock was lost more than five percent, but eventually it was able to reduce losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation of the rescue action in the United States will influence the financial markets around the world," observed Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, that is, independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal for support for the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would be at risk of being affected.
U.S. Action Blood Bath
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the draft support for the financial system, to which it should have devoted up to $700 billion (about 12 billion in Kč).
The legislators thus renew the appeal for the support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
America's actions last Monday, a bloodbath, and the main action indicators are the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost almost seven percent, having suffered a fall of such a magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress Ceda: US government can inject 700 billion dollars in banks
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement to the US financial system.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
American legislators made a decisive turn in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial assistance amounting to $700 billion (about 12 billion crowns), granted to the American financial system.
Success is not so sure.
Indeed, before the final version of the law can be published and submitted to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The support plan of the financial system will be reviewed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
It says Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Regulations of the House.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor in reducing financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "disillusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have regulated our divergent views on the form that should have the package of measures for the stabilisation of the market," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg Agency.
According to it, the final vote could be taken as soon as Sunday.
On Saturday night to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government a final form.
This should buy from financial corporations the real estate assets that lead financial enterprises to significant losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
There is still a need to continue this plan for the recovery of markets, but I think we are there," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the declining stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators make it possible for Congress to reach a final agreement on Sunday.
They thus wish to calm investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress' decision could affect Monday's trade.
At the moment, however, it is impossible to determine with certainty when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote, even if the negotiations are not likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by such a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted during the coming days.
However, the law will still be subject to many changes.
The total amount to be allocated to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars, as President George Bush wished, must be available as soon as possible.
However, if Congress has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, it has the opportunity to block the remaining amount, in two stages: first, $100 billion additional dollars, then, to end, 350 billion dollars.
Mr. Bush welcomed the progress made in the negotiations
Although the President may vote in favour of this decision, Congress, he, has the opportunity to make it a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain funds for the purchase of bad real estate assets, including the value of the shed, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday with the vote of the law, and the Senate Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bilateral effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, a negotiator in charge, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributors against losses, the agreement on damages, the implementation of the timetable.
The new Act also provides for the limitation of the gold parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee that will ensure the supervision of the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Department of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for real estate owners who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new accounts in the case of mortgages that it will purchase, while reducing the monthly debt of debtors and allowing the latter to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological aid
According to the Economist leader of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult.
"This is due to the fact that we are not aware of the mechanism and the price of the purchase of assets to problems.
This point will be crucial to close on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," says Marek, this week, on the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not, according to Marek, so important.
"It is much more important that Congressmen agree, from this week on, that they support this plan and that they will devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at this time," says Marek.
Extremely driven fight: MP3 readers against mobiles.
We'll advise you on how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 reader can call.
It seems clear from this that it is better to buy only one phone.
It does not prevent enough reasons to seek an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a cheap high-end gramophone to put Maxim Turbulenc's new album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disc, and, from a quality point of view, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
However, if there are vinyl discs inserted in your layers, with rock, jazz or blue art, you will at least probably dream of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during movements, i.e. of compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - of music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, in the same way that a Pink Floyd fan would find it hard to support those who bought for twenty crowns on the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The life of batteries is also crucial
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than a simple music reading, but this is, of course, unknown functions of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephone calls and text messages, it is able to read music and movies, record the latter, it has a variable quality photo device and can, for example, even serve navigation.
And if you take the smartphones and the communicators into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no TV will take pictures, we're practically watching a miracle.
However, the universal character of the furniture is not without inconvenience.
The more functions you use, the more the interval between two recharges will be reduced.
And reading music is one of the most important energy goinfres.
In most cases, the number of mobile phones that are able to read from music for ten to twelve hours is significantly lower.
In this regard, the music players (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more efficient.
In the case of marketable mobiles, please note that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you can call from time to time, look for, to be out, a second recharge for work - this is even valid for the more expensive devices.
There will be no problem for MP3 readers, who are able, following a rechargeable, continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performers.
Another problem occurs when the music is recorded in the cell.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a USB universal connector, since not all can be directly connected to the computer without a special software.
You can of course record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to take without reduction, given the small sizes of memory cards used in mobiles.
With regard to readers, you do not need any software, except for iPod.
Just fill in, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers themselves will create a media library classified by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, style, or then by the user's judgment.
Some devices show only an index with a tree structure, such as Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
In choosing a specific device, you are especially interested in the life of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you're going to listen to it for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you'll have enough of any mobile reading the MP3.
Almost all mobile phones are now able to do so.
You are not even obliged to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the reader is able to read.
Everyone gets to read the MP3s and the great majority of the music that will reach you will have just that format.
It is part of the most widespread formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices also come to read from WMA-format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple firm and its iPods), as for it, is less common.
High-range mobiles also allow for, for example, the purchase of online music.
It is enough to visit the corresponding operator's (or other provider's) web pages from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service to him alone should be a convincing reason to provide a musical mobile.
The offer of operators is unfortunately unbearable and, in most cases, it is limited to fast-paced radio tubes.
Prices are no longer the lowest.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (either through GSM, internet, or the wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their own furniture.
Every time you want to listen to something, you only have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
Now, it is also important if you always have listeners or a handfree with connection.
If that's not the case, you can use the built-in rings, which have virtually all the mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 readers.
For many, the main advantage of musical mobiles is their price.
The less expensive is usually less than three thousand.
For a price of three to four thousand crowns, you can already have a very suitable walkman.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for ordinary listeners.
The price of the best telephones and the best equipment, also provided for ordinary listeners, does not exceed 15 thousand.
On the other hand, readers have the advantage of having an easy order.
Indeed, no one can ensure the command of the most rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the order with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or of a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a random-connected mobile Internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to use
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models in principle only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones even come out with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you still want to buy a good MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are part of the most demanding audiences, choose specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the control device approaches an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the farest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a life span of the battery (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, our operators offering almost the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force traditional operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTU (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of a SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation could arise - the SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators less expensive than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, since we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this regard, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Czech Telecommunications Office Council (CHTU), said on several occasions that there was no room for another operator in the Czech Republic, he argued with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network seems to have no more chance (at present it would find only difficult frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a significant decrease in prices, to which the traditional operators must then also respond.
However, even before the introduction of such disturbances as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those heard today at our home were heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was room for such operators and that they could have real success.
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the virtual Mobilking operator.
In just six months, this operator has succeeded in winning over 100 thousand customers and becoming the fifth operator in the country.
Let us add that behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which has, among other things, the U:fon in Czech Republic.
The benefit of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need much less customers than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the costs of construction, operation and infrastructure of the mobile network, which are relatively high.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators are profiled as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile, in Britain, offers SMS at least two times less expensive than its competitors.
However, as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland, missing on an unusual target group can also be a good start for advertising.
In fact, this operator is specifically aimed at men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be possible to go to us as well.
Miroslav Čepýk, Vodafone's spokesman, is doubtful: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
As much as it is relatively satisfied from the point of view of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, the mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project successfully, but negotiations in the Czech Republic are not very provocative.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area," said Jana Studnikková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
It thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do their best to ensure that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step to become a real competitor of Telekomika in business customers, has not been hiding for quite a long time his intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We have a lot to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile.
And the sooner it'll be the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have succeeded in moving forward in the negotiations," said the spokesperson of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
So the future may be promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we might be able to host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At this point, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared to other very specific ones.
For the time being, no matter provided with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," Vlastimil Sršenj of the Press Department of Phoneika O2, mentioned in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesperson Martina Kemrová states in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not recorded for the moment a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited time frame, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone rather directs its attention to the fulfilment of requests to obtain its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepýk says in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we think means most of the inputs from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile Internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a lower price and thus to a lower profit.
What, then, is good to facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to feel like we're going crazy. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U.S. background also bears witness to this.
The biggest apparent pressure on ČTU, during the creation of the U.F., was the one exercised by T-Mobile.
Evidence of information available to the public from the CTU's website.
Today, the U.S. is ready to use as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted in this regard: "In addition, competition on the mobile market has recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player will make it subject, and especially its services, to high requirements."
However, given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies appears to be disconcerting.
However, this is not just the attitude of the CTU, which, contrary to Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Agency for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached for the time being, as the offer of potential stakeholders did not prioritise enough interest for classical operators," said Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the UOHS in response to our question.
A statement thus made would not surprise the representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care that no one benefits from its position on the market, such a statement is more than a waste.
Moreover, Kristian Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their market entry has contributed to a drop in mobile phone services prices."
However, pressure in the sense of fair functioning of the market and a price reduction is apparently not part of the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is truly shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, is of course a question.
In the same way, a price of fuel strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to the accident and the hard fight against competition.
"The office has not noted any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so there is no reason to intervene in a way or another.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore none has an increased corresponding responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably even missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa stated in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many differences.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CTU, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some law experts suggest another vision of things: in order for a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained at each time.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least alarming to the UOHS that three mobile operators proceed in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many stakeholders (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in the negotiations with all operators.
Reducing responsibility for ČTU is a fairly common turn in communications, whereby ÚOHS washes the hands of the case.
We have already met this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been able to bring about the renewal of the Telecommunications Act, which has recently been adopted, an extension of CTU's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement in the situation.
This is something that the representatives of the UOHS need to know very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work.
This says, the operation of a kind of virtual pseudo operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains undetected.
These are companies that publish their own price lists of mobile telephone services, but they are only partially public.
In most cases, it is a matter of firms dealing with multi-level marketing.
For example, specific mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these companies are generally only available to the electorate.
The magic tour consists of the fact that the company does before the operator is a classic business client, which orders a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it receives special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a return.
"If what you say was happening, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would consider and that could end the collaboration with the company in question," answered our question about this problem Martina Kemrová.
However, it is unlikely that an echo of such an activity will not reach the leaders of the mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator shall object to such a procedure.
In fact, the activities of these firms bring them unattainable benefits, and, at the same time, by contrast to true virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepýk indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a percentage of negligible customers.
In addition, they are obliged to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot have it fully available in the way of regular customers of mobile operators."
This is precisely what should be strange in the CTU.
In addition, there is another question in the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the UOHS has relatively broad powers to be able to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the operator's explanations, which claims that there is no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibiting it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant decline in the price of services.
However, in almost all countries where virtual operators appeared, classical operators were increasingly, less and less, trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It is precisely at this level that, in the developed countries, the regulatory bodies, which did not defend the interests of mobile operators, but those of their clients, have intervened.
Both through formal measures and by informal pressure, they ended up obtaining the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies deal with this issue in the form of a hot potato that is released by passing it to a close target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in their skills is more than beneficial in these cases.
But don't throw the trigger after the cognac.
If the information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear at our home, the Czech mobile market may be moving back in.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS will hardly remain unresolved in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech National Hymne.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the day of Czech nationality, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new records of the National Hymne Kde homev můj (Where is my homeland?).
Hymne was re-registered by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with heart and an instrumental version.
The song is provided by Kateřina Kněžzynková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the Hymne arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted Český rzhlas (Czech public radio), he chose to interpret the solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"Since the beginning, I have tried to make sure that both singers, as well as the choir, have a good word, so that we can understand the words well, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech National Hymne will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde home myj retentit for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the Theatre of the states) in Fidlovčka (Kermesse des savetiers), Czech play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroop.
It has become popular and people have self-appropriately adapted it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national hymne.
It will remain one of the seven national symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
How 'new' sounds
Common transport (MHD) in Prague will introduce the bullet in their ticket system on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of Pražský Dopragrní podnik (the Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will get into the metro, trams and buses, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to almost one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard card.
Passengers can buy a coupon for 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both have it recorded on their cards at the information points and offices of the Doprahrní Podnik (the Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nadraží Holeshovice, Andel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy online coupons on the Dopravní vdnik websites: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can permanently forget the tickets in the metro stations, where they had to so far become impatient in long queues in order to obtain paper tickets.
In fact, they will purchase their coupon online and will be registered on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these contact points, there is the availability of passengers with a trained staff, which will help those interested in purchasing via the Internet and will also record the coupon they bought on their card," said the spokesperson of the Martin Opatrny project.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminding the machines to compose tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, it should have twenty-four," Opatrny added.
An auto will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Just enter the Opencard card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
It is known in the periurban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly use the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pražská integraváná dopróra (Integrated transport of Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zone validity of the coupons," explained the control of the Ropid’s Filip Drápal tickets, which sets out the time schedules for common transport in Prague.
Periurban buses are equipped with integrated card readers in the driver's seat.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the deck card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the recorded coupons.
"In cases where the passenger would need to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing more simple than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the periurban buses and will not remember the date of expiry of their coupon, may re-enter the automatic distributors, initially used to record the coupons on the card.
This is where information on the validity of their document will be displayed on the display of the device.
The Sutes claimed a referendum in the United States
The Germans of the South asked for Shumaava to be incorporated into the United States in 1945.
This is the result of a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vedecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the South Bohème).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the United States of America at least.
In 1945, some groups of South Germans claimed to address the president of the United States with such a wish.
This comes from, among other things, a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vedecká knihovna.
From the Germans of Český Krumlov in the letter, the US President is asking that only "shumavská zupa" (a region of forests south of Bohème) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have fully understood the situation and want to be sure that the words proclaiming that the American troops come into the German territory not in oppressors and enemies, but in liberators," is written in the letter, "People to whom the fate of the Shumava is at heart."
Since the association with Czechoslovakia is not allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - that brutality, indifference, incomprehensibility, oppression and duty, the authors of the letter ask the US President to take in his hands the protection of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would give this territory to a foreign state, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which has nothing to do with the Allies victory without taking into account the opinion of the four million inhabitants," the letter says.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire to avenge the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans in Shumava, he would only have to organize a referendum in the region, according to the authors, to establish whether his people wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, in view of the current knowledge of the history of post-war, appear somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the South.
While the Czech Germans had to at least consider that the issue of their expulsion from the republic would be a matter, very few of them had this opportunity.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to obtain a certain type of autonomy for the South.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirmed it.
During the war, he was, as a German of České Budějovice, engaged in the Navy in the Baltic countries.
At the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the catch camp in the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them the Czech.
"They thought once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the Germans who were captured living in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that he would be expelled from the Republic, according to the Beneš Decrees.
You don't think — you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
One way to characterize the emotional media campaign is to launch the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Rébíček's office believes that she will discourage drivers of dangerous behaviour at the wheel.
This campaign of 150 million will appear on television, on radio, on cinema, on the Internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage the drivers of fast driving and alcohol on the wheel.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
In particular, she wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians, without forgetting professional drivers.
What's going to happen in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also bears witness to the slogan "sangling" throughout the campaign:
You don't think — you pay!
The phrase "You don't Think" is written in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a blood bottle, there's the phrase "You will die."
What must symbolize is that one can pay for life a moment of care.
Spots will "hand" the spectators until 2010.
The department was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen commonly with dramatic images of the victims of accidents.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
Spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The Strategy for Sugar and Fouding Against Drivers
"The one who walks with the drivers is the system of sugar and fuet.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by the use of time, when they spark a red fire.
Fuck, it's the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be recalled to the drivers," says Martin Kořán, the transport psychologist of the Na Homolce hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press, and especially negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
Panels indicating the danger to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert would exchange peace almost all occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli Interim Government, voted in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all territories (occupied), or all," Olmert said daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), because without it, peace will not be made," he added.
He admitted that the possible return would include Jerusalem-East.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all he does not want tractors and bulldozers to break his feet, as this has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked, referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, where several people were killed and dozens of wounded.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" within the Old City.
"He who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the whole city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won't work," he said.
Retirement of the Golan Heights
Olmert also voted in favour of Israel's retreat from the Golan, which he considered to be an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (whom the Chit movement); they will have to give up their constant support for Hamas (whom the Chit movement), Al-Qaida (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are Stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency's bus car near Padoue, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move within the bus during the journey.
"If the law was to be strictly and formally respected, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," said the spokesperson of the Department of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road of the car.
The young girl was now unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had at her disposal two other seats.
However, the car may have an accident, or even a sudden brake, also when the driver serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the car is based on its technical sheet equipped with standing or not seats.
If this standing equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long-distance buses Student Agency have no standing places; what was confirmed in Aktuální.cz by the company's director Radim Janchura.
"It is a matter that we have dealt with with the department and, at first, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilets during the journey provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law ignores the stewards
"There is no single legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal requirement is taken into account in this role.
On the other hand, there is no legal requirement to prohibit the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds Hanzelka spokesperson with more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorny, the director of the road transport department, believes that the law deals with the problem.
"Everything depends on whether the car has the permission to offer standing places in its approval.
Everything stays there," he said.
The cars are divided into urban areas, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, intertwined with standing places and a higher authorized speed and long-distance buses with the highest permissible maximum speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like on the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Horín, an expert in BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in planes.
No more, it's not sure when there's a turbulence and the hostess of the air can pick up your head."
"Or, where the car would have suddenly stopped, the laws of physics would of course be valid.
Just like in a bus or a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewards by internal requirements," he said, and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Janchura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer Stewards services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the Director does not consider their business as a business at risk.
"Nonetheless, as soon as I have the impression that this is a risky business, I will delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and their logbook on board.
This would also reduce costs," he said.
The concern for security is the reason that the director of Asiana Alexei Litvine, who, compared to SA, provides a very small number of lines, gives the absence of drivers in his vehicles.
"We have no hosts, we have opposed them from the beginning.
It will end sooner or later with a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
A Great Tragedy Has Come
A young hostess from the Plzeň region, who has been working for society for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using a flashlight and blocked the road to the car.
The driver of the latter trying to avoid it by a sudden manoeuvre, but he broke it on his right side.
Janchura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards were sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to book these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the young girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but with regard to financial compensation, it also counts on the guilty.
An amendment to the law?
No view
An amendment to the Act, which has been being drafted for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Department of Transport, could provide details on the movement of drivers on board the bus.
"Or, it has not led to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, it is not too interested in the bus, but rather in the point system, at the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the portable on the steering wheel," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider Stewards' activity as a fundamentally endangering passenger safety," Hanzelka spokesperson concluded, stating that the control of the safety of buses is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois are based on Frankfurt.
The main words were not lacking in the letter addressed by the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the financial institution of Düsseldorf with the deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central financial market institution of the financial group of Sparkasse" could constitute itself, according to the mail made public on Monday.
WestLB would provide a double "competence block" of sustainable productivity in such a case.
Overall, such a relationship could be the decisive step towards other concentrations in the banking sector of the Länder.
What does this look like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times?
Because the WestLB, injured, is still under strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which has only recently made it clear to the Government of the North Rhine-Westphalia that the time was spent looking for a future solution.
However, it has been a matter of some time already - also on the part of Frankfurt - of a relationship of any form between the Deka bank, which knew the customers of the Sparkasse from their investment funds, and WestLB.
Certainly, the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas informed during the presentation of the figures in the late August semester that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse's house with a bank of Land, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deca Board of Directors, each half of which is supported by Länder banks and savings groups, has commissioned the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint business activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it.
However, the talks are just beginning, it is said in the financial place.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, who, with its 3,000 employees, has one of the most important employers in the financial sector in Frankfurt, is involved in the issue of the consolidation of the savings fund sector.
In 2003, it was believed that Deta-Bank could be merged with the Bank of the Land of Palestine and Halbab.
There's no sign of this piece of land, though.
The plans had hardly been made public that the government of the Land of Hesse voted against any participation of Hellaba in them.
Next, the other two houses did not join.
The Bank of the Land of Rhénania Palatinate was attached to the Bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new treatments on the deka-Bank's grouping with Länder banks.
Finally, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had voted against any commercial fusion strategy with his bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to spread that the grouping of different institutions in the public sector is particularly urgent.
Now that the elections in the Bavarian Parliament have passed, a union of BayernLB with the Baden-Wuttenberg Land Bank could be achieved first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure that forces new mergers is to increase, the potential partners will gradually escape it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far been better able to resist the crisis than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The Hesse-Thuringe savings and rotations group, which has 85 per cent of Helaba's capital, drew a lock at the beginning of the year on all the union with WestLB.
It'd be hard on NordLB.
However, such geo-strategic reflections reflect only one facet.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different commercial models of each of these banks can be picked up.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive issue, namely the commercial model for the future capacity of Länder banks, had not been resolved so far by the German group of savings and rotations.
Finally, a WestLb decommissioning may take place, which is obviously not desired here.
This is also the case in the letter from the Steering Committee in place: in any event, a 'global solution' for the institution would be addressed.
How will all of this be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank still to be seen?
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanied him as a little friend, so nothing is the same, he said.
Behind them, about a ton of five litres of beer from the Kaiser brand, there is a well-built barbu that shows about 200 visitors to the beer festival which its satisfyer can produce.
Elena taps Luca first, then kisses him.
From Bologna, they came to Verone.
From there, from the road station near the new Puorta station, four buses take off this evening at 23:45, `destinazione Monaco, festival della brewra', arriving scheduled at 6:30 p.m.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travelling exclusively from Brazil.
In one corner of the park, the South Americans sang gold and already alongside their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also deaf, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for Italians.
Buses belong to Marco, which has a long double coat of fake fur and glasses with large silver mountings.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three turns nothing but this year.
They go out at night, stay the day at the party, and come back at 2:30 p.m.
And spending the night would involve unnecessary expenses, explains Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, broken in accordance with the Bavarian Purity Act, sickness insurance and a German-speaking group manager - Marco made a language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already rolling in the night on the Autostrada direction 'Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything gets calm in the bus, the travelers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates are taking a break before Munich, on highway 8.
When in the morning, Marco's group finally arrives at six thirty hours as planned on the parking near Thérèse, almost 50 other buses across Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco has a last speech, explains the attack plan.
First of all, it's the little yellow casket.
Above is written on the left 'Berry Party', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco `konocersiviagiano.it".
Second: "When the doors of the chapter of beer open, we're short," Marco cries in the morning.
Run! Run and book the seats at the bottom of the tent.
'Don't go ahead, or we're stuck, and not all the yellow helmets on the same bench, we have to distribute them in the room!'
The chop, calls Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the sign!
'Show the security agents that we're doing well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: 'This night, to come back here is ten hours and a half!'
And that's where he went to the beer party.
On the road, some nine of the yellow caskets on the trees to find the road, the panels and even an electoral display of a large Bavarian popular party.
We're supposed to be ready for the return.
It's the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'week-end of Italians'.
There are no specific figures; there are 50,000 people who travel through the Alps and fall into the beer kiosk, 10 percent of the visitors would come out of Italy this weekend.
The municipal police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol policemen, by Italian volunteers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which produces statistics on the countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (approximately 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the attempt of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia nights for Hipo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system was relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used the word "relatively" and that he was pretending that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This one actually happened this weekend.
The finance of the Bavarian real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE), next to the DAX, receives from a consortium of German banks a loan of a billion to protect itself from market turbulence.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters Monday that aid appropriations were granted up to EUR 35 billion.
Hipo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
Money comes from both private banks and public law banks.
In the background, it is Depfa's subsidiary that supports the loss.
The state finances were, according to a newspaper article, refunded in very short term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the lack of market confidence.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from EUR 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio also slightly decreased from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions were, compared with the same period of the previous year, down to zero, profits from the allocation of fixed assets and securities, as well as the provision for credit operations had fallen by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only thanks to the important benefits derived from the reimbursement of low-cost accounts resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the deficit of approximately 16 per cent profits has been moderated.
After privatization in 1990, the former state financial had at first miscalculated real estate industrial loans, which had then been affiliated to the Aareal bank.
Because classical state funding was not profitable enough, Depfa was then more intensively engaged in infrastructure projects and in joint financing of projects between private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Real Estate Hypo must make depreciations that should have an essential material effect on the group's profit and loss, which is still rather vague.
The fact is that dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had been beaten to two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate is, since the purchase of the Depfa, a highly important state investor and infrastructure.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing on the interbank market since it does not have any customer deposits.
With the failure of the Lehman Brothers Investment Bank two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks was once again very expensive, the banks having accumulated their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a share annually - about 50 billion euros - of all the Depfa's credits of a short-term refinancing method.
According to a report from Hypo Real Estate, the group's need for funding is covered by medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of the way.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through the funds until the end of 2009.
On the other hand, HRE Director Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer use the medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Establishment for the Monitoring of Financial Services (Bafin) are based on the principle that the capacity of the Hippo Real group on the market is now assured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors are only waiting for it.
However, in view of the dynamic and impossibility of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not surprising, however, that there is no shortage of funding in all its scope.
But the opposite can no longer be removed.
After the bank is, according to the latest communiqués, still at the doors of insolvency at the end of the night, this rescue for the least temporary will not be able to assure the spirits no longer.
The rate of action was 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
The rates of obligations, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While the debt to the first head is barely shifted, the second-level loan rates are falling short.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hippo subsidiary and those of course who have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate bank seemed previously to be an alternative speculative position, and their value should now be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net severity of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that led the crisis into the establishment by the purchase of the Depfa bank.
As long as the less affected emission institutes, governments and commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to assume a resorption of delays over time.
Or it will happen what no one can expect at this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that approached the suretity has now become a simple founded hope.
This should reserve sleep nights for all long-term creditors to decide whether they should separate from their commitments.
In the short term, investors can always use this on which they have drawn a deal to make a deduction of losses for the next few years on the income tax on the capital of automatically taken stock gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, is due to be present for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls begin to laugh: German is so "kawaii" !
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knew this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Trade Log, she speaks of Japan.
"The first day of the course in Japan.
What I was excited about.
Already on the way to school, I was scared.
I live in Tokyo on the outskirts of Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I have to find the way alone, I'm glad I haven't lost myself.
The start of the courses does not seem to be fixed as strictly as we do in Lower Saxony.
The students appear after each other from eight hours, until nine hours less than twenty, a table tour begins with the professor, the "home room".
But before the course started, it was for me to introduce myself.
I'm not exactly like to talk to people, especially a class of 40 students.
Since I had not yet the uniform of the school, I put on an old jacket from my mother, as well as a shirt, blue shoes and black leather shoes.
In this manner, I presented myself before the papyrus, and I tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo She Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I came from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to start learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class did all the lows, they could laugh and make signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him through my sleeves.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary for the survival of Japanese ado and means "mignon, chou".
Then I moved quickly to my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, and she thought it was an honor for the corresponding dock to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite calm, but when the gong resounded, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to who was better, could laugh and asked me a lot of questions - in this case, it's hard enough to understand the English Japanese.
During the break, they all left their Bento.
My foster mother had also made me this kind of lunchbox - it's really different from the miserable Germans.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sauces, a concobre and algae salad, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat right here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's sure is that everything's really good.
All right, except maybe the friggin' confectionery, huh?
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento which she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of getting a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read it in my sleeves.
I'm curious to know if I could observe it here, too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
So I always said:
'Cause it's fascinating to me, what's going on?
After all, reading mangas, that's what I've preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangaes and culture that is there, at some point, I also started to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cafard was in danger, does that mean he feels scared too?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
But how can we verify that it is the same when it is the same as us?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of replies to the question "What do you think is true without being able to have the evidence?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of conscience without me or anyone else who has so far been able to prove it, as we cannot prove that other human beings have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and approach the questions of feeling or in general of consciousness, we will enter difficult-to-practice fields because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he does death, escape, or attack.
Human beings behave in the same way, so some scientists draw a comparable subjective life from it.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transformation of our subjective life to that of the animals difficult.
One aspect is that circuits associated with human consciousness are almost always included in the frontal lateral cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in management and execution functions).
This vast region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and appears to be completely absent in other beings.
So, at least for these aspects of our conscience, which depends on the prefrontal cortex, including the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from the other primates.
Another significant particularity could reside in the linguistic nature of Man: a large part of his existence is linked to language, which often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness was not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is so difficult to determine what the consciousness of other animals can look like.
If this, internal and subjective, is neither measured nor, because of this particular hardware, analysed based on our own experience, then its observation poses serious problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious life, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
Animal awareness processes could be examined without taking into account their content, and that is exactly what happened in short-term study of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also emphasizes the weight of the frontal Cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what is the result of the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its suites, such as the reactions of the body) takes hold of the living memory.
In this way, emotions are closely linked to the cortex regions that characterize the primates and especially the Human.
The subtle degrees of the feeling, associated with our voluable nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, distinguish and categorize states to impose them on others other than ourselves.
To the contrary, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that feelings from primitive activities are born in the regions of the cortex corporal sensation and the brain trunk, as is Jaak Panksseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain trunk.
As this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could fully participate in cross-sectional feelings in all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I can't contradict it, but I think that is inexcusable.
Pankseep argues that what looks like fear in men and rats is likely to feel as well as in both cases: how can we still verify whether rats and men feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A coward was in danger, but if he feels afraid?
In my view, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical veccus.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, but the cafards on the other hand do not even have a brain.
But is the brain trunk the origin of the sensations?
And even if we could prove this to Man: how could we demonstrate it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even the cafards (who knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to show it.
And because their feelings are probably completely different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than emotional feelings of rats.
In all cases, progress has been made nervously to the extent that we eat the same thing in rats and in humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I do not know if they exist.
We could think of it as a short-term one, but I prefer to move forward rather than get stuck against a wall all the time.
I'm really a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, President of the UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
The Deputy Prime Minister, Ivan Wasjunik, explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Vasjunik announced.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work just started, and there is still much to be done in both countries."
In the schedule of the construction or destruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stages for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA has kept an eye on us."
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the PZPN Polish Football League was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that PZPN is not able to act in the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish PAP press agency.
"We have provided in a letter to the President of the UEFA that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League have already been sentenced in the previous season to compulsory relegation; in the end, the start of the League has even been postponed to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid angry counterattack
She wanted to make the promotion for a new movie, she talked about her private life in an interview - and now she's bored with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan raised the veil on her former adult Dennis Quaid.
It stands out - and counterattack.
A late War of the Roses for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are released to a pitiful battle - the sight and the south of the world.
Last week, Meg Ryan said in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have known the extent of the fraud only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it's told the story of an adult.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his reputation as a unfaithful husband clearly fell: it would be "Monstrelle", he said to the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg restores the history of our relationship and manipulation."
It would be even more "reparable", than "the punishment and the disturbances that involve a divorce for each child would be re-evaluable in public" for their 16-year-old son Jack."
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So his answer was, "In any case, my life continues.
I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's going to the best."
Flight ticket prices and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008, flights and night hotels were less expensive than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be even reduced to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would be beneficial - this is the result of a study by the financial service provider and American Express travel provider.
The company analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, established a net decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities considered still 6.9 per cent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear in Paris and Rome, where travellers were paid from 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all of this would be for American Express in the low dollar course that led to a "desire of low travel of American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanovre, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are increasing by 26.3 per cent, the record in Europe.
Also with regard to flight prices, the trend was increasing in the first quarter:
Due to an increase in the price of kerosene, economic-class passengers have to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-distance flights, which are highly fuel-consuming, have even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of economic class tickets fell on an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, business class and first class, however, the price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this price drop would on the one hand be slow economic growth, the firm explains.
The request would come from the ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition by the "Open Sky" Treaty which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The sign of the trend is the removal by airlines of non-profitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies nothing but in Europe.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the first of the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay still failed to find a function eleven.
De Kristoff Klein. Granddir. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player will only come back late in the game and his shot up failed against the target framework.
His message was specifically formulated, he was out of his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," shuffles Hermann Rieger in the hall of the Hamburg arena.
It wasn't a big deal in the wardrobes, the mid-time was over, and most of them were in their seats.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of HSV for nearly three decades, he enjoys a great reputation as well as former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received at strategic locations.
Assistant Coach Cornelius Jol has acquired and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the coach in chief of Hamburg Martin Jol.
So the orders seem to have been similar: and that is the second goal!
There was a lack of practice.
"Everything wasn't very nice to see today," said Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would have "suddenness also to be more relaxed".
The 1:0 (1:0 at mid-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful hit by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not harm the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a great victory," said Marin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate this Monday in 121 years.
As early as Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen indicating their club as the first of the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
"We can take care of it," said Marcel Jansen.
It is likely that the mid-term result of the table reflects more of the unpredictable character of the first League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen disembarked from the FC Bayern - forms certain slowly, but it does not shine yet.
"We need more charm and more dribble," Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
On Wall Street, the scary circle.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan dropped the Dow Jones temporarily from 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of history.
Later, Dow Jones got a little caught up.
About 20h30, the world's largest stock exchange index cost 10.579 points with a drop of well five percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange Index was 1548 points with a decrease of more than seven points.
The most lost of the Dow Jones were at that date American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could report any more benefits.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares charged a decrease of almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the major investor Warren Buffet was associated with the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilised for the purchase of what is called damaged mortgage paper.
However, the amount should not be paid at any time, but progressively.
On the other hand, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that could be exchanged in relation to the course's evolution in order to reduce its burden on the Public Treasury.
Courses of action at the Tourbillon in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not address the concerns of investors.
The course of action of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index collapses despite the rescue of the state's financial market.
The German index (Dax) has led to a profound deficit in spectacular decreases in Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank's courses.
The Bavarian real estate fund has now lost three quarters of its value despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank has charged a decrease of more than 20 per cent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the important psychological bar of 6,000 points and was at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Worldwide, stock markets have fallen to the knees.
In New York, Wall Street was working with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US Government's 700 billion-dollar rescue plan could not be sufficient to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809,25 points lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first opening hour.
The House of Representatives of the United States intended to vote on the rescue plan, and the vote in the Senate should follow on 1 October.
The other European scholarships also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index charged a decrease of 3.2 per cent, and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese index of Nikkei fell to 11,743,61 points after an increase of 1.26 per cent.

The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist multinationals have further indicated that the shares will not be sold in Thomas Cook.
From the dark material influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in the perplexity: the dark matter has influenced the speed of space probes as they are called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Because of soon-frozen fuel pipelines, death is a cryogenic threat.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused the development of researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, through which they obtain an additional wave in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example, the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical tool, as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what has surprised researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent of the way they are expected under the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the attraction force of the matter because of the curve of space, could not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study always believes that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support by what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also located near the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have known the existence of black matter only for about ten years.
It appears to be a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it neither sends nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their predators, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released as well as confirmed by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The Sudanese predators had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting prior to the release, six hostages would have been killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom would be already under way.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnappers gluer.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are clearly free.
This is what the Egyptian television, the Arabic television channel Al-Arabia and the Italian media have delivered in concert.
The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian TV bulletins Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians and their eight Egyptian companions behave well and are safe, the Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants in the trip to the desert should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the release of hostages remain fluctuating: the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army kills six kidnappers without shouting a strike.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the agent said.
It was only to collect the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers had killed six predators in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, and had arrested two of them.
The tenants had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money had to be paid by the German woman from one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" said that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the reapers wanted to release the female hostages after the payment of the ransom.
Men were to be detained until the predators found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this account.
The abuse of a beautiful father "who leads to suicide"
A court has been informed that years of abuse caused by her father-in-law have led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Treise, 57 years old, of Stithians, in the Cornoailles, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight counts of accusations for misconduct.
Truro's court of great instance reported that he regularly read his beautiful daughter, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years of age.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Melle Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at Mutley, Plymouth, April 1, 2007.
When she was living in Coventry, Treise had attached and banned her before forcing her to sexual acts, while her mother worked in the public.
Treise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to the Cornwalls.
His beautiful daughter left for Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Melle Randle, a volunteer assistant of National Trust, was subjected to abuses that had been inflicted twice a week.
The Attorney General, Ramsey Quaife, told the court that friends had told me that Melle Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "lost all hope of life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's beautiful father who had written a letter of confession that ended up like this: "I am the attachment and the bandis regularly".
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Treise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly be terrified, especially at the age of 7.
"This devastating saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is that if she hadn't done this, her story would certainly never have ended in court."
He added: "I particularly stress, as his father and mother describe it, the effects of your crime committed over the years on Stéphanie.
"Without them, she would certainly be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today."
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Office Cabinet's ministerial officer who had forgotten the top secret documents, in June on a train, will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, to the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was moving when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a waterloo-led train.
The documents were passed into the hands of the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
The BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They will have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is charged with breach of section 8.1 of the Act, that is to say, the clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the departmental officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of Secret Services.
The documents he had lost contained appreciation of Al-Qaeda as well as of the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning and was then transported from home to a secret place.
Building companies face the B&B bill.
British building companies might have to pay an invoice of more than £80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect the money of the savings, including 59 companies in the building.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it is "angrily" to know that companies and their members will have to pay the broken gates...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when the mortgages of Bradford & Bingleys are disbursed.
But the interests that are going to increase at the same time, will be owed every year to 700 financial companies that collect deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It's annoying to see that institutions that have had prudent behavior... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay a sum proportionate to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest in the loan will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Commercial Committee of Building Societies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair.
It's annoying to see that institutions that had prudent behaviour in the resumption of the real estate market now have to pay much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first years.
"We need to consider all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to avoid the companies and their members paying this sales bill," said Mr Cole.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interests of the whole year will have to be paid, which could also double.
Since building companies are non-participating organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
The milk increases to five pennies per litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to increase the price in bulk of her milk, five pounds per litre, from Monday.
This is the second increase in the price resulting from a two-penny increase in February, and is the result of a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retail sellers must decide whether they go to their turn, increase the price for consumers.
Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk had been varied for the last time in 2002.
An ex-Pm of Bangladesh has been found to refuse the bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a request for bail at the former PM Sheikh Hasina, which could thus be arrested on his return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him his bail on the basis of his review for exorcising a man, 50 million Taka ($729.00,00) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many charges against him.
Khaleda Zia, the always rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh a few weeks ago, but her party, the Avani League, demanded that the country's provisional military government give her full freedom first.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of his release are contradictory because if he was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, he did not see why he could not remain free on his return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she would now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's application saying that she did not need bail since she had been authorized to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this security to return to the country in order to prepare the elections in December
Sheikh Hasina should return after October 17th, a former leader of the Awami Party said.
She was held in custody last year after the Acting Military Government assumed power, but was released in June to care for abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, denies the charges they are charged with.
Concerns for the Afghan anti-polo campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children were missing the recent polio immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the United Nations said.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign last week in the six provinces.
However, she said she was unable to contact children in Helmand and Kandahar dangerous areas, located in the south.
A United Nations spokeswoman said that despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or obstruct the thousands of nurses during the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the ITV court battle
BSkyB has lost its trial following the judgment of the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV broadcaster.
The Competition Appeals Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares by 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and had allowed it to influence ITV unfairly.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that the purchase by BSkyB, part of ITV, had raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, thus encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss Richard Branson, a group of consumers, and the regulator Ofcom were all contrary to this purchase.
BSkyB pointed out that the need to reduce its ITV shares would not be reasonable and, on the contrary, was excessive – especially since BSkyB had just given up voting rights.
New investigation into the case of American prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to check the issue of the release of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
All was born from the case report of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical to the officers of the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political reasons.
The Special Prosecutor, Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"There have been serious, potentially unfounded, criminal conduct charges that have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of the greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the radiation in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the Department had stated that the prosecutors were fired for medical benefits.
But then it emerged that the licensed prosecutors were no longer critical of their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to give them political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others would have refused to investigate false accusations against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute the judicial bodies for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but cannot be for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has been accused of being involved in this licensing case, and in the end he resigns.
A number of ministerial officials from the Department of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered it "first responsible" of these licences, and ended by "abdicating" his role as leader," which was remarkablely not involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush collaborator, Karl Rove, have been critical of failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's sword must be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored at Q Awards for his epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar during the ceremony in London next week, said to be "honored" to obtain this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of the hit by Meat Loaf in 1977.
The evening of the award ceremony is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a limited selection of four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things such as time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly a party
The song, written by Jim Steinman, demanded a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrument section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was placed in the UK, as a single in 1979, in the fifth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in English rankings, and was sold to over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of her real name, has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing surgery to heal her heart attack became irregular, after she collapsed on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then he was found in the vocal cords.
A Shadow Street in the City, often forgotten, and Maybe Etre Bientót en Sales.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-term local residents can't give indications to go to Extra Place because they've never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and travels north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty wave rather than an active artery.
No panels indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to resume Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-term neighbors, have said to be charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the house.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the neighbourhood owners committees, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay drew up a proposal allowing the real estate manufacturer to buy the street.
But the Committee prefers the street to remain in the city's hands, and asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No.3.
"There are only few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to preserve Extra Place" she said.
"They could propose to restore it and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to reinstate the small street and install seats there, some would also be used by a coffee to which the manufacturer would grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, the spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to exploit the street, that does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner.
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is to relook for this abandoned departure, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale".
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Immobilier Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, stressing further that the agency's mission was to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to his most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical print.
Some believe that Extra Place has been bearing this name since 1802, when the legacy of the large farm of many Philip Minthorne's children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has been abandoned.
The later entry of the CBGB, a closed punk rock monument in 2006, opened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of rails, hailstones, barricades, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about evolution to the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public.
Others proclaimed Extra Place as a true rareness - a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be fixed in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who conducts a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: An Amerement Nostalgic Look on a City in the Extinction Process") relates the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, dark day as night, and delimited by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and blinds, full of newspapers last week that circle along the gouts."
With few exceptions, the street is always the same.
A short rat at the bottom of the street, near a door leading to the CBGB, which is now the seat of a store of chic clothes.
Graffiti on the walls, a bottle of 22 empty ounces of beer, lies next to newspapers that just have been thrown out.
Some passersby said they thought only rarely at Extra Place, and suggested its development.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some under-the-way people were interested in the attractiveness of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have taken place in dark, wet and delicious places."
The Bilingual debate: Immersion in English
In this part of the Education Monitoring Program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, former student in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as well as Good as You Think It. Why the middle classes must be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favor of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr Obama's campaign highlights that "African and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students." it is a true fact.
In order to combat these differences, Mr. Obama's educational program particularly supports so many other subjects, "transitional bilingual education" for those learning English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to carry out a bilingual education that supports instruction in languages other than English is also of interest to eliminate differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the east of Los Angeles.
The students of this school are largely Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, consisting of many new arrivals, study English.
Among the CM1, 100% students passed the 2008 Maths State Review, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students went through the study of English-language-d'arts
This incredible success was achieved through another ingredient that Mr. Obama had advanced.
Sixth Street put on analysis, practice, constant capacity assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, Linda Mikels report, head of the Sixth Street, has introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
The total English-language immersion focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Melle Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, said "we had an enormous success with a student who just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went away without his class, you would have had no chance of identifying it."
"That walk, does she notice, "it worked for us"
Mr. Obama should not take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results of this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its huge support for bilingual education, obscured the forecast of Mr Obama's response.
Although it is favorable for immigrants to learn English, Mr Obama has recently considered this issue insignificant when he proclaims that we must all stop discussing the wording of English-language laws.
"On the contrary, he will say, "you must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider carefully the models of education that work, rather than denouncing them or treating them as insignificant.
Cute Net of Oil following the New Concerns of the World Economics
Oil prices have dropped significantly on Monday, as people fear that the rescue plan for financial marches will not be able to give life to the economy.
Gross oil operations fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. The New York Stock Exchange, when sold this morning.
Prices have dropped from more than $20 in the barrel since Monday.
In the last two weeks, markets of raw materials have been drained by the financial agitation of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After having seen an increase of $145.29 in July, prices fell to nearly $90 in the barrel this month, before rebounding to the deep uncertainties of the financial markets.
On Monday, investors are again concerned despite the rescue agreement, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will purchase the bank operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
The analysts at Barclays Capital said that the frenic negotiations of this weekend end, concluded with the rescue agreement, seem to have failed to bring the market back."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"The prospect of global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors."
"we believe that raw materials will not escape from this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand until the American virus spreads globally and in particular in China."
The bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, they were therefore obliged to reduce oil and gas prices by 20 per cent for 2009.
The Second Time Determining Festival for Team Record Improvement.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in uniform with the Jets Shaun Ellis, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He was looking at the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this before," Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played in the midst of dark clouds.
Then the fourth back Brett Favre managed to take a pass at Laveranus Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor from one afternoon during which their relationship made a bond in advance.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a back corner fell and the second, 10 seconds from mid-time.
"I'm not out of my area" Favre said about all his passes in Coles.
"it's a middle-class player."
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Cole were playing in the trap, the defense beat the Cardinals' fourth back, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards up to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
In the last change, the loss of Bowens' ball, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this property in the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking advantage of 34 to 0.
It was best that the Jets were able to mark in a while.
"The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, to whom we were asked to describe this madness, said "the second or the third time?"
When he was told the two Jets left 21 undisputed points in the third time, Mangini said, "I can tell you that I appreciated the second time more than the third time.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gebrselasia resting, exceeds its world record.
Hail Gebrselassie, Ethiopia, once again proved to be worthy of her title as the best background runner of the century, after beating her own record of the world at the Berlin marathon Sunday, thus becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory at 2:03:59 from a stay on the board, Gebrselassie fought for 27 seconds his record of 2:04:26, fought last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselasia won the 26th record of his great career, during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance of 1600 metres from the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselasia had missed Beijing's Olympic marathon, scary - it can be exaggerated in today's eyes - that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect weather, 48 degrees from departure, 55 to arrival - Gebrselasia won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The track runners like Gebrselasia and Paul Tergat, both kenyans, converting into background runners, have contributed to the reduction of marathon record over two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselasia told reporters, had suffered cramps at the mill two weeks before, and had missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to stay bright, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"It was all perfect.
I was released last week, and today, I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best."
He was reproached – especially in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia – for having too much orchestrated his races, avoiding the world stars of marathon, counting in fact on the books as if they were in a track competition, and considering the world memories more than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the capacity of Gebrselasia as a background runner.
Sunday Gebrselasia, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. on my way.
Two kenys elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to refer to Gebrselasia after the file heads disappeared.
A little over three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie made her final upgrade to take off Kwambai, which ends in 2:05:36, improving her best personal record for five minutes.
Kamathis arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year from the seventh time of 2:19:19.
English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone who won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She could not participate in Beijing games because of a bad back mortgage, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
It runs using a skilled strategy, allowing the group of Ethiopian runners and Kenyans to take a good advantage, then going over them about 18 miles 1⁄2 afterwards.
Ascale Tafa Margasa from Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21:31, while Helena Cyprus, Kenya, finished third at 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, just a few miles from the sunset, the brilliant and giant Orlando, there is a small quiet town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first completely black city to integrate, the children's house of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to do today." The city with five lakes, three shorts of crochet, 300 dark leather, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and not prison".
She has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Zora Festival every year in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city that she described has become a tourist thanks to her inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is also independent, worthy, and private that she was not already in the 1930s, when Hurston told us that Florida's black rural population was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, doesn't know what he's losing".
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also called for an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious about the foreign side.
"We are very careful about how to tell the story" said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, who has always been the oldest Parisian of the city.
"It needs to be consistent with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It represents both a historical model of a power of blacks as well as a community of nearly 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point, but also an example of South-South black rural culture - sometimes deformed, sometimes accommodated - that recalls the birth of American slavery.
Which would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in Eatonville's image was born with Zora, which everybody here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the whole world through sincere books, full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Wee Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just at the exit of Route 17, a route that crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which ended in the chapter of black history and human drama.
As bold as such a big crate in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"through the road on the left," she wrote, "you will find the modern public school brown and white, with its gardens and these well preserved playgrounds whose Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he hardly knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can serve the passersby.
So, hardly a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with a government car, but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait everyone liked.
Zora well described the reality "declared Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's young girls who Hurston immortalized, quoting colourless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added: "Some people didn't appreciate it."
We always remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who often returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalled that Hurston used to arrive in town without warning, on board a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wore pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many were laughing at her.
"people were always happy to see Zora" he said.
But he adds, balancing himself in his postpareto chair, which gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
At Hurston's death in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was now a star in literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 20s, she was buried in a grave somewhere in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lives.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the great public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or heritage she offered to the world "declared Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a Hurton biography published in 2003.
A crucial moment comes in the 1980s.
Public officials in Orange County wanted to take a five-way highway to town to replace Boulevard Kennedy, the main street in the community.
Orlando's development has already moved Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just returning from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, among other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the race mix dispute led to hatred at the gates of the community.
"at that time, a band of white youths came to launch oranges or objects against the people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"a lady is even dead."
They threw a paste of their car."
In a 1955 letter addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the application of the Supreme Court for a forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glamorous of my race."
The residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and weakened the confidence of young people.
"The black children were used to being kissed - I remember it well - we kissed our master in the morning, and also in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, as well as the head of the Community Security Council of Eatonville, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white - I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here," Melle Nathiri said.
Civil rights, on the other hand, have allowed the creation of space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as her, armed with a cheerful self-reliance and lines of conduct such as: "how can they escape from the pleasure of my company?"
That's beyond me."
In 1975, author Alice Walker went to Hurston's anonymous grave and began to struggle to revive her reputation.
Five years later, a biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduces it to the American cannons.
The project of the highway came just when Eatonville's most famous girl had found her attraction.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston considered it a lifesaver.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the proposal for the highway.
"The five-way highway failure, extremely fast, is a real civic pride," said Melle. Nathiri.
Melle Boyd summed up the whole statement that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A single theme library (renamed Hurston, of course) will open in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, renovated.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be considered a rear street during a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 per cent black today)
Foreigners who have come to discover the history of Eatonville, its reason for being, are still being treated with caution.
You have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things - like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Melle Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weak for the living red, are always afraid that their island community is not well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered its entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, no better or worse, but also proud, creative, boxing, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is good for the sincere civil affection to be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for younger people, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-olds, winter Park twins, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people who pass through this area will think, "Oh, this city didn't compare anything to others" Alondra Kenon said after the last Sunday lunch.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone speaks well of finance.
Even so, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the big TV kiosk and screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and bead offices above their heads, the bankers and cover managers who monopolies New York spend the worst "working day in the office" since 1929.
The suppliers continue to falsify on the sidewalks, with their cariotes and their muffin plates for morning meetings.
The Latinos are always drawn between residential buildings that, like morgues, hang fifty luxury shirts on a yoke on their shoulders.
Office employees continue to make the queue to buy their morning sandwich to the traveling merchants, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4:00 and 19:00 a.m.
I did not feel the crisis despite the completely pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I was planning to work late at noon, because I was going to discover my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, a 20-year-old.
Not in front of the cassettes of the cashiers, not in order to remove the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service, where the usual customers ordered their bosses, the tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and the new customers would open accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would learn later from Starr, my "authorised personal banker", all made the tail for the same reason I did.
In the same way, because they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They withdrew their money from savings accounts called trifits (such as a building corporation), credit associations, and the type of local savings funds and their subsidiaries that function only in a state, and who say to treat customers like their families.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a 327-dollar bank used the bankruptcy union, and while the New Yorkers returned home for the weekend this Friday, another bank, Wachovia, to the savings accounts of $440 million, desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and employees of stores that are in front of me, stripped of another potential leak, have transferred their money to a bank that seems to them to be reliable, or the one that makes Wall Street the most lifesaving.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I understood a lady at my Chinese local supermarket, speaking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that failed, and his superior general Dick Full, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lynn, the uniform concierge of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my fruit and vegetables market.
She told me, after my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take any chances."
Muslim tombes profaned while Austria turned right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and , Philip Dewinter of the right Belgian Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "city against Islamisation" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road panels illustrating red-haired mosquitoes.
Police accuse extreme extremists of profaning an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend end of the victory of extreme political parties Right to the general elections of the country.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; this is according to the police, an organized action.
The criminals painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as David's Star; however, the detectives believe that this could have been done to quench the hatred of extremists for Muslim immigrants.
This accident could be in some way linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the Islamic Local Community stated that he was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this profanation, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that touches him at his end.
Austria is seriously thinking of finding its courage, following its oscillation to the right during yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that picked up almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria carried out an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, as xenophobes.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against the port of the foulard and burkas, and even voiced his opposition to the food alaha.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and mines, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who have made the difference because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter prohibits travel abroad.
The courts banned the rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse of children, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he had expressed his intention to go to Spain through France.
The Kent Police had granted this prohibition to travel on Thursday after proving to the judges Glitter's guilt for sexual abuse on children.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at Ashford's limited court hearing, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
One court spokesman stated " Thursday, 25 September at Ashford's court, Kent's police asked for an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't present then."
Glitter, 64 years of age, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leaving to be included in the list of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he may punish up to five years of imprisonment.
Kent's police said that she would not discuss particular cases or possible movements of Glitter in the county.
A spokesperson for the Kent Police said, "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as foreigners.
"We think it is easier to monitor someone who lives in the United Kingdom because we have devices that can manage any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"protecting the people of Kent is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we monitor closely the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls, aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane for Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he says he's not feeling well, and he refuses to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him for passport control, and finally he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused entry into their territory and were therefore obliged to leave for Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on August 22, and, while his lawyer, David Corker, stayed there, he went to Uxbridge, West London's limited jurisdiction court, for registration in the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as requested by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been sentenced to four months in the United Kingdom for holding child abuse images.
One source of the Interior Department said that Jacques Smith, the Interior Minister, was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from moving to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master outside the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
We don't have to wear any extra clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, released from all tensions to obtain the respect of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
The other one, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, at these moments unknown to the general public, where we discover intimate gestures and stolen glances of artists who do not care to get on stage.
German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flemenco - people" theatricality of some scenes with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer resumes the particular iconography of the flamenco under different angles.
Included in the programming of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of the flamenco, larger every day", explains the creator, who explains that "Flemenco - people" "may be any one but, having seen the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on the scene.
These photographed "in the street" are artists capable of conveying on stage the passion, sadness, joy... by captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you don't have to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a clean character.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera of the instant personality of the stars of the flamenco."
With the festival "Popular Chant des Mines", Bauer started a long journey in 1997 to photograph the singers, guitarists or dancers with a record camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the equipment, remember the classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of the flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day."
This is not about dancing or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the public with his art.
The search for essentials and magic was the constant of this work presented today at the El Fotómata gallery.
The flamenco beads such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about sixty-ten photographers.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book collecting portraits exposed to the gallery.
The passion for Bauer portraits brought him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Old Sports Portraits" ("SportARTProject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a longer or less time.
I think in photography the picture is the most difficult kind.
You find yourself in front of people, characters you sometimes don't know or leave just a few minutes to get them to take a picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flemenco - People", is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located on the 20th Street of Mata (a street parallel to the People of Hercules), which will be opened until the next 16th of October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he wrote is "true courage"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to make progress on the new project on which he works, a novel that has for the main character Roger Casamant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in Congo for twenty years and has passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize Prize in Literature confirmed yesterday at the Hay Festival of Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it "is a real courage" and that "all it shows that it should not write it".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the Festival of Exchange of Thoughts and Thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people in the city of Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was the most expected character in the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award to the majority of the participants, completed the room at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, met with a fascinating audience who did not see the time passed during which Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, retraced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst for reading" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote "very methodical" through intensive documentation, correcting and rewriting a part of the text to face his "miss of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Hispano-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "rendering less similar people," because writers were asked "not to let themselves go to the frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather takes over Pozoblanco's faucet
The party of the banners that concluded the pozoblanco fair taureal races was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse torrids checked that the arena was impracticable.
In this way, the organization committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The evil of time has come to the fore, as finally two parties on three could not have taken place.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled bull race.
At the show, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who had to face in the arena of Castilblanco.
So only Friday's party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was brought in triumph, after having made arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
In the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered gradients applauded more than his struggle with the bull himself.
Worse yet for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he suffocated most of the audience.
Police check of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Five hours less than ten in the morning.
Control of the movement of the police of Euskadi (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Commune d'Armeníón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van, and the latter take over the escape.
His load, more than two tons of hachisch, of what to stop them.
The police have prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to the information disclosed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Basque Government.
The individual arrested was charged with drug trafficking and document falsification.
The incident occurred when several officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle check on N-1 at the border of the Armenian Community.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed the orders, hurriedly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers away on the lower side, where the two occupants descended to escape into a forested area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hachisch they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The later part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch balloons. Then they moved to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "false" since it did not coincide with that written on the grey card of the furnace, that is why they charged the detainee with a falsification offence.
Ertzantza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who has managed to escape and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old prisoner A.A.J. has been warned to carry out the various approaches and will be judged within the following hours.
actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of a drug
The actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw him do strange maneuvers trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, after a spokesman for the California police patrol opened the People magazine.
The witness pointed out that at 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was deeply supportive of the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and walking back several times, she was rolling on her sunglasses".
Shortly after, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop in the middle of the highway and left his vehicle.
This person, at the time, called emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She had the air disoriented," that's why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol center to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative, and alcohol abuse was eliminated from the beginning, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we pensioned Locklear under the influence of a drug".
Locklear was arrested as he was suspected of leading under the influence of a substance that had not been specified and was incarcerated at 19:00 and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left Arizona clinic where she was hospitalized to care for nervous depression.
Callazars asked the Andalusian Federation of the Union Gauche to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The UN Gauche General and MEP Gaspar Llamazares today stated that it was the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former advisor to the Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of treating his family favourably.
"In these cases, I am a very federalist, and this will be the Andalusian organization that will take on its responsibilities," Llamazars said about the behaviour of the political party that he will have to adopt within the municipal council of Seville.
However, the leader of the Union Gauche has requested that investigations be evidence of "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The Union Gauche has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all employees".
"Mayo's blood," Garci's bear
By inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Spanish battle against the French in "Sand of Mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros in budget.
The filmmaker has tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" he has always admired in the work of the famous romancer, has he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film of more than two and a half hours, "Mayo Blood" will be released in the cinema halls next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid in more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós literature, José Luis Garci ensures that with this tour "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who charged him, three years ago, to film a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2, which he always accepted when the story was held by the national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Madrid Community constitute a "unique opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the ambience of "a Spain that has failed as leader for the fight, as the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellion under Ferdinand VII's rule", he reported.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not get any funding as for the films" Captain Alatriste" or "Goya's ghosts" - more than double that obtained for "Mayo's Blood" - because he couldn't turn a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcarcel, with which he collaborated during almost all his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver has started" has influenced his usual way of working, on the stage of the actors, with whom he has the habit of repeating before he starts the tour and to whom he does not make a casting, since it seems to him to be "humiliant" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and cinema to keep himself informed."
Many actors in "Sangre de Mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranñaga or Fernando Guillinén Cuervo.
Four times as a candidate in Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy," Blood of Mayo," "Seven tables of French billiards" and finally the winner, "The blind turnsols", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "who would deserve to be better known", he said.
With this film, Garci doesn't expect a price.
"At first you think you're working for the poster, and then you realize that you're working only for prosperity, and now you're happy to make an extra movie," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón gets into the skin of the Sevillane dancer Tortola Valencia
A sevillane dancer will pay tribute to a sevillane dancer as well.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and a Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and will live in London with her family at the age of three.
He was a free dance dancer and a specialist in Eastern dances.
It was a passionate life, pioneer of the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and complained about the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked the history of the dance in Europe of the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter suggested that I interpret the Sevillan dancer Tortola Valencia and that seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we don't try to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think about the flamenco.
Thus, "the dance of the papillo" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the dance of the snake" at some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to her," she said.
The stage was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: the one by Miguel Poveda who sang Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done at "La porta openta"; and the one by Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with the one who was his student.
"Matthew transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me."
The performance was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Ariaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the beatings of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of such artists who were considered to be gods".
This work also relates, in a way, the life of this woman, who has been displayed in places so far, especially for the time being, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she was normally living in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think it's these women who have an enormous influence in their time and now no one knows or appreciates their work," says Bayón.
The show will begin at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a Recently Married Poet" in the Church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " comes to an end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This People of Light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling to various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Taberno and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America please less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "No Malik", and well illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in view of the striking idea that Newman is no longer in this world.
He had the pain of getting an Oscar.
He hasn't been back since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
That was a tough blow to everyone.
"Sometimes what a person feels exceeds any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to his existence."
No one was afraid of becoming ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and bourgeois markets are afraid, American estimates have fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and there is no reason to live, there is nothing left to human beings but admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He incarnated for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was Richard Nixon's enemy and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in the honor of his late age as a result of an overdose and the creation of his own bio-food brand.
It was a victory for a country that had the penalty to be imposed on a food culture of suicide.
This expansive wave of admiration hit Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman named Sam Mendes said working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad guy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, used to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put us in the top bar," said George Clooney, who may be the only one today who tries to penetrate the screen like Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious private life and far from goals.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle of today.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years in Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though opportunities were not missing to be him.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to be funny.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he has interpreted, he has never been as proud as that of the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and the philanthropist," he says.
Madrid in the 2016 Olympics event
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race, we're not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever had.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would have been the subject of an elimination note.
But let's look at it in detail and at the beginning.
Errors begin with the removal of files, which forces you to go ahead.
This is not bad, but if they move you it would be better than giving you everything (including the electronic arrow for the races).
Well, no.
They only made you go down there to take the file (first error, move only for this) and (after a long queue) surprise! there was only the size of the S for the mesh (second error, because I need an XL size)
In which world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy more than small-sized petals with less fabric and less expensive?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the races.
In addition to the fact that you have to go there very early to remove the electronic gun, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your bag behind at the entrance.
The expectation lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long waiting line, the competitions began and we had not yet left our bag behind at the entrance, although once it was done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the waiting period of more than 40 minutes during which riots and barricade strikes took place.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be in the classification with the right time, because of the gun they gave me who, I think, did not mark the departure correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to quote a perfect example of race, it would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the city host for the 2016 J.O.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MlT Emerging Technologies Conference, a new human image recognition and interaction system was presented, a species of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in Microsoft, a shuttle to move into the company's campus) in response to what was asked for during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, which are - including recalling their positions - and listening and listening to the key words of their conversations.
But also group them by conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person, but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asked if she was here to visit someone and she told her that she would answer in a few moments.
All of this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this is the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week, more than one change in Microsoft's strategy was discussed.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will have no more associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would be five times faster.
This is a discovery because Microsoft, after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extracts" to Windows.
The change in strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first Google-side approach to compete in Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for the computer equipment and software to be understood.
It is the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your beautiful mother.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but we must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, but more and more to the Internet browser.
We only use the computer to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than walking windows.
To whom do half of the applications provided with the system serve?
Who can do the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain less applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less complex, month by month.
For the time being, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I'm showing you an example.
The photo in this article was taken early this month in one of the restrooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the drink distributor, a display of their request to use their own search tool - "Tas search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not expire at the beginning of 2009 but by the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, seems more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wearing one in Edward Zwick ' s Blood Diamond, as well as Al Pacino ' in Francis Ford Coppola's Parish and was part of the holding of the Muscle Gay Association.
And if we were to list all its appearances, we could also quote this mustachou cost that raised weights in an outlying circus.
It's just a simple male-body stain in cotton, milling and without sleeves.
The English call 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all others.
First of all, by his branding name - although known as 'Marcel ' - which has to do with sports because he takes the name, according to legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel is distinguished from others by his excellent cotton, his unisex cut, his distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (unrecognizable) that the most well-known body petals have in the neck.
But attention, because the Belgian brand only produces top tanks.
But it also produces sweat-shirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothing designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it's damaged to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't bother me"
His enormous similarities with his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, Cruz sisters take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
According to Monica, they are only beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new social headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important prices of the fashion that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica's hot and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and myself created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of the Opera in the honour of Valentino.
A very intense day, but at the same time exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The film of the 1950s and 1960s enthralls us and inspires us a lot for our collections.
I love walking in the city and watching women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do so.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very polyvalent woman, aren't you?
I believe that yes, but at the end of the day everything is coming together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was little, I liked the clothes; I'd like to go to my grandmother's house to look into my aunt's closets and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my manner of dress.
Dancers love to dress well for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you wear clothes, that's where you actually put yourself in the skin of the character.
All of a sudden, it's all connected.
You haven't been there for 30 years, has it been hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30s are happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoy life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I've wanted to do since I was little, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you're going to be a mom?
Of course, I want to be a mother because my body asks me to be a young mother and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movie, you're waiting for the different movies you've been playing last year to come out.
It's true, I'm afraid they're coming out.
I who am a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and anxious, I would like everything now but of course it is not possible.
I'm hoping to get the films 'The Last Hour' and 'Searching for the tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what you're gonna think...
A few days ago you started on the pass with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I'm not up on the pass to make the mannequin.
Just because Naomi Campbell called me, I have known her for a while, to invite me to participate in a charity show in London for her association in support of women and the clothes we showed - I showed two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold to auctions to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
The people Naomi is a tender person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things aren't true.
Besides, it's so good on Naomi's side that I'm fascinated.
She asked me to show up for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to make the pier, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Rifidists from the wheeled alcohol should install the 'alcohol' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol, to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting in hive condition, or if he does not breathe.
The initiative has already been announced last June, and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last a year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road re-education courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for Road Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of the motorists arrested for driving more than once in hibernation, the car resumed.
The alcohol would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the wool and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before; or when the driver’s alcohol rate is higher than the authorised one.
Its cost is more than EUR 1,000 and is in charge of the driver.
In this respect, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced to 65% of the offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 people every year.
This measure only applies to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, as legal reform can be done by ordinary means, but the reform by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental one.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote for an initiative by the Spanish socialist party that proposes to install this system in school buses as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., scheduled official time, the Spanish Air Force aircraft in which the Asturias Princes travelled to the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the alert to sleep, but its rays were still forced to put the hand in the eye so that the royal couple could see down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier, I had asked the cab driver on the street if it was up to the Spanish Princes to visit the city to complete their official trip.
- Oh, well, you're not gonna be able to go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... are you here or what?
- No, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking for two years.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who are the Princes of Asturias and knows the importance of the trip.
They are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military range of 27 Marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in sea blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is dressed very highly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with photographers before going to the room where the official court is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a regular journalist of Mexican television awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there is certainly no designer living more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international image of the new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded at a price of EUR 300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his models in Mango's window at the 54th Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost wept.
Of course it is the second largest brand in Europe that has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylisticist Valentino, president of the competition jury, made us meet in a luxurious dinner at the Garnier opera in Paris.
With a table next to the extraordinary Chagals family, the Presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown up on the heart and making a good heart against bad fortune, because of his brother's recent death, Nati put on a mango dress and some ELAH pairs, which cut the breath, and arms on them, arms down with his son Luis - a beautiful man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a male gallant, as well as Baron de Rotchil, ended the night without clothing because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who presented herself to the store with a pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner was metamorphosisd by wearing a long sexy and black dress, she hummed when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the Ballet repetition room and recalling the good old time, she caught one of the bars and she made the gesture of a 'big fold'.
Inés Sastre did not remain for the visit of the palace's dependencies, but she showed us earlier on her mobile phone pictures of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man who moved by motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his drawers, his towels and asking for the front door, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there's life.
1001, the number of stress
There are only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to crown everything, they are all listed in a book that will bring relief to the librarians on September 30th.
The morning awakening almost attracts us when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse when we think of the rhythm of the agitation that imposes on us the present life.
The office is synonymous with tension and the back pain computer.
Stress represents the evil of the 20th century.
But there are neither two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But it's 1001, not one more or one less.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole menu of methods adapted to taste and time.
The work against stress is entitled '1001 ways to relax ' and will come to the bookstores directly from the editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain peace in relationships such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' debates such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or natural revenues that help you relax.
If adrenaline does not cut into your veins to restore balance of your body and if stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking and Sleeping
Some children talk during the night.
I do not report to those who wake up very waking up by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk during their sleep.
The first time this happens can surprise you, but actually it doesn't matter.
It's a blessed variation in sleep that's called sleepiness.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course there's more than one who talks during the night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (once in life, for example, associated with a severe fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing more.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often linked to other sleep alterations such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (infant pipe to bed) or somnabulism, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very strong fevers, stress situations or overexcitement.
Anyway, it's a little bit of a studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, murmurs or otherwise with screams, tears, long speeches ...
If sleepiness becomes very common, it would be fair to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes much anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We said that it is a welcome alteration, so there is no treatment, unless it is related to another alteration in sleep that can be treated (e.g. if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What you can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, find quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have the pain of relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm themselves inside.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the dreams appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember no more than what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'll wake him up.
Even if he's talking, he's asleep and he's resting.
Remember that if he becomes very anxious several times, he is advised to consult a doctor or to check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not have the temptation to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because you're sleeping, he's not aware to be able to organize his mind.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, suddenly pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to know his secrets.
It's not even fun.
This causes much anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illusions... finally
Illhaeuesern finally found the path of victory on his field after a long period of dysthesis.
Without a great match, the Young and Blacks have created the greatest number of opportunities and have succeeded in transforming one for the win of the game.
The pace was not much supported during this meeting where attackers had a hard time expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the captain of Kauffmann, who slammed the lunar on a remote gun, Illhaeusern was going to take the ascendant and turn the Fonderflick away, then with Hirn above, Roman from the end of the foot or Diebold came to take the defense of Denmark.
In front of this, we were stuck in the middle of the ground and left the Riahi Remunant at the point of the attack.
The beginning of the second half would be decisive with first two signed occasions Riahi and Temporale for Denmark, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhausians by Marais, well positioned to resume a dance based on a first attempt by Diebold (53e').
But the Illhausiens butter will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to get the vests back a dozen minutes later and leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Denmark will not be able to take advantage of it and will not put a big problem to an Illhousen One who just withdrew a little to "compact" his defense, except in the last few seconds of the game where, after a big cascade, the ball passed very close to the transversal.
Sarkozy at the meeting of the angry fishermen
Before flying for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will be surrounded by Britain.
In view of the strong demonstration of fishermen who were deeply disturbed on Monday by the access of several British and Nordic ports, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning in the Finistery to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he will "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit at the same time as the General Assembly of the "crisis committee" established by British fishermen to obtain measures against the flow of gas prices, which reached a record of more than EUR 1.14 per litre on average.
According to Elysée David Martinon's spokesman, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses find competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and compensation for marines".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out raided operations in Morbihan and Calvados, which resulted in holes close to 10 km.
Quiberon's pleasure port was also blocked, but links to Belle Island have not been stopped.
A filter barrier has been launched on the nearby island of Quiberon.
Marines have already shown their determination on Monday by burning tyres and pallets at the Brest ports, and Lorient, as events took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic and Manche façade, such as the Sables of Olonne, in Vendée, where the shells remained on the quay, or in Havre, where twenty vessels blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire-Atlantic, stopped in the evening the block of the important total refinery of Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting in the department to decide on any action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by members of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not miss anything" and "do not want to move to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient, for example.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on gas, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre but they believe that the profitability threshold of a boat is only below EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman's magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died from a cancer sequence at the age of 83 in his home of Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes welcomed the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft table on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that lie on the world economy.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 delivery devices, says Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much from the Chinese market, in particular for its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years' time.
AIG would consider giving more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the US monetary authorities have flown, plans to give up more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that has been advanced to it, according to the Financial Times Sunday edition.
AIG is prepared to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activity in the United States, states the newspaper that mentions sources close to the file.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met Sunday evening to consider any transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to separate include its International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% in Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance and its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, continues the FT.
AIG must quickly realise liquidity to repay the $85 billion loan that the Federal Reserve has allowed it to take 80 per cent of its capital by the US authorities, diluting current shareholders.
Analysis Paris History of the meeting Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange charged with a historic fall on Monday after the rejection by the House of Representatives of the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a loss of sight near 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest fall in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of the trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, which is technologically dominant, increased to 1.993.73 and the standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1.106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street drowned after the unexpected rejection by the House of Bank Rescue Plan representatives, which was supposed to bring some stability to the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 against, the representatives rejected the Secretary in Treasury Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"This shows the extent to which the market was in this regard," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would not "be too late".
"If the project is actually dying (...) then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, etc.) and to other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further strengthen the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, a head of economist at Global Insight.
And stressing more the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, Mrs. Piegza stressed.
After the failure of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has rapidly accelerated, leading to emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, and sign that markets are facing "not only an American crisis but a global crisis", the FTN Financial analyst added.
The compulsory market has been very high.
The 10-year-old Treasury's return to 3,632 per cent, compared to 3,827 per cent on Friday night, and 30-year-old to 4,161 per cent, compared to 4,357 per cent on Wednesday night.
Obama, winner at the points of the first television duel
In the first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House, another one came to know who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, took it.
No surprise, Republican and Democratic campaign QGs announced their own victory in this television duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "bright" enough to allow him to record his downfall in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion survey published on Saturday, gives a five-point advance to Obama (49 per cent versus 44 per cent to McCain), believes that it is the democrat who drew his spin from the game.
Among the undecided voters, who count, Obama has won 39% of the polls, while 25% of them give the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his progress on Thursday with the expected performance of his collier Joseph Biden during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts," said Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seven-year-old McCain has never ceased to put forward his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "neighbourliness" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... he's accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he said.
A hammered attack angle since yesterday in the Republican TV advertising.
Obama pointed out that he was the future.
Without disassembly, it became clear and precise.
It has put forward its ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama, yes," said, this weekend, a democratic spot reproaching the Republican for not taking all the measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American Street".
"For the forty-ten minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, he denounced Obama, yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a rainy rain.
He did not even pronounce the words "average class" or "workers." The financial passage clearly benefits Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most likely to save the economy on the edge of the precipitation.
"The coming week could be a decisive turnout," he estimated, yesterday, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an elder of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current debate "is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating that it would still be possible to reduce taxes of 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's subsamples, the Illinois senator also noted that the country's possible energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he, wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudents, the two candidates avoided the financial saving issues of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents manifested themselves on Sunday night at the main site of Belarus's capital in order to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
Several hundreds of Belarusians met on Sunday night after the polling stations closed in central Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some agree not even to vote: "What's good, because they'll do what they want from my voice," says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime which has done good is a foreign observer in order to resume language with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by observers.
They weren't in the opposition.
"We have been kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the disappointment," said Jourry Potemkine, the spokesperson of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous group of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change, says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in us, it's the executive power.
If members of the opposition enter Parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entrance to Parliament can mean television space, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis, and that we are not reforming, we are at risk of becoming a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, does not recognize the validity of the vote.
She stressed that the participation figures appeared to be too high, and that the generalization of the vote by anticipation (26%) of the voters in Minsk) had opened the voice to all manipulations.
"You've noticed that there was an election, you've asked the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozuulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition to Parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls back on the place of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The interview - From safe red blood
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained the confidence of the public that had been seriously shaken by the scandal of blood contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and the horror of the public, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer occur.
While Judge Krever was late in filing his report, some provinces then set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, only 38% of the people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalled.
The situation was discouraging.
With efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground during the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said before she proudly stated that in early 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Decary, however, maintains that "trust is something extremely fragile."
On 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of the disease of the mad cow, a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, have been seen in Europe, which has been holding the strong since its founding in 1998.
"And we did not know at all if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which, when unknown and which can result from a serious disease, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a brain degeneracy that inevitably leads to death, has been excluded.
In April 1999, therefore, the blood of those who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
But a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease was transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV testing technique appeared on the market: nuclear acid (TAN) tests that directly detect the presence of the virus itself in the donor blood, not anti-virus antibodies, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have allowed for a short period of motion, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our technicians, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This has significantly reduced the risk of some donors being infected without knowledge and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, a person of 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV- contaminated blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission occurs with a blood product.
I believe that today we can feel at ease with receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," says Hema-Québec's head of management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen is going to emerge in the system.
Not later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
Hema-Quebec must be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to security supplies, Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies.
"The needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
As anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need to be recharged in red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the blood donors network, which is only on average 3% of the Québecs eligible for the blood donation."
However, every healthy person, aged 18 and over who meets the eligibility criteria may give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of those who offer their blood are not accepted because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria is present, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Poverty is very rare.
But the members of this donor network must be renewed as they age and cannot give any more of their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to hold them back and encourage them to become a regular donor.
Today's life is so frenzied, it's rarely the time to spend an hour giving his blood," says Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that are almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec which also manages the only public blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was now considered a biomedical waste is a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the launch of our thousand blood sample of cordon and is expected to take more than a thousand per year.
We should begin to propose it for graffiti at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Decary, who describes this program of cord blood collection as very popular.
"Several mothers are disappointed that they can't have access there," because Hema-Québec has no means to offer this complex and costly program in all Québec hospitals.
Soccer - The impact in half-final
The impact of Montreal qualified for the semi-final round of the final series of the first USL division, thanks to a victory of 3-1 (4-3 total goals) at the Suunders de Seattle, yesterday, during the second and final match of the fourth round of the final series, at the Saputo Stadium.
The ground environment Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of play.
After a first half without purpose on one side and on the other, the David Testo and Rocco Plancentino field environment marked the other rows of the Montreal training.
Roger Levescu was the only one to enjoy Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let us remember that during the first round of the return series on Friday, the impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, at Seattle.
The impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in half-final.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder completed a 3-1 deficit in the return match to carry it back 4-3, but the Whitecaps also joined the semi-final round 5-4 in total goals.
The impact should face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Winning Goal of Kovalev
The trio number one of the Canadians is ready to start the season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec took two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by marking the only purpose of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet, has prevented the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried too much to do it in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a good ovation."
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the holding of elections before the end of the year
In place of the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) tried to be elected at today's partial election.
"Reducing the limits of our last large northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was designed a kind of Moulin with images.
On three huge screens, there were spectacular scenes of hydroelectric dams, mining, Québec sightseeing "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means, as in an election period.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would open the elections this autumn, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Nord Plan" is the fourth bread of a "vision" which the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, the one of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory of the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister was reluctant to explain why the North was "a jewel to the immense potential", but did not give time, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At least a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydroelectricity, the forest, but especially the mining sector, doubled by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as large as France", "it's home to us, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it in us, but it is in us," he insisted, as well as showing that he was seeking a national founding myth.
Québec has built much in its relationship with the North, has it pointed out: the road to the gold in Abitib, the Québec engineering, the Bay of James.
"It's for us, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister stated at the press point.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no understanding for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I repeat that position on behalf of the government," he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the north-west crossing, which will open all year round because of the source of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers the occupation of the territory to be a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former Peachist Member of Hungary), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) had an important place to start work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be "concerned, ordered and respected by the environment", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the prime liberal minister who preceded it.
"Like the liberals that preceded us, we have thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed rebaptizing the Beauharnois Central in the Adélard-Godbout Barrage.
"De Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage, who made the Calm Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Borassa, who made the Bay of James, our party has been forging the future," said Jean Charest.
In the press, he referred to another reference, conservative there, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing Eastmain1a-Ruper's hydro-electric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that his service was planned for 2012.
"It's still between us, but I'm planning to be there," he told his militants, and they're giving them some kind of compliments.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and no doubt in 2009, did not deviate from the possibility of holding a poll this fall, which the law allows.
He points out, however, that his schedule is complete, including a mission by the Federation Council in China and a summit in Québec-New York.
The General Council at the end of the week provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that were passed as a letter to the post: PLQ in particular called for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto right on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the main lines of the Northern Plan were welcomed with skepticism.
The Pakistani leader, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to it, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done so, "we would have made more progress today" said Ms. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutin which is taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADA said to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that this is not just a show," said Sébastien Proulx, in lieu of Mario Dumont, who is back on vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (on irony) in Harper's office, who was allowed last summer to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "hont" for Canada.
In this way, throw the reproach on this woman who has waged an incessant battle for justice and who deserves all our admiration as long as the Prime Minister's siege and Stephen Harper himself.
We are facing a government that is the only, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its citizen in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no note of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts that reproached him.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, renegotiates its words and leaves a child soldier in inhumane conditions.
The only one who refers to a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remind you that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among other things, is a petitioner for the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not care that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, no doubt ever after so many years of exaction.
We still do not realize it, but we are now seeing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the word that Harper stops branding and sounds so loud in his mouth.
This is the time when there is no morals anymore: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprisonment a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a government leader until the minority (which will then be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that calls for the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what was doing the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In his edition of September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of Canadian mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has attempted a six-million-dollar campaign against three authors and a small editing house without the sound in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would it be to ruin anyone or to support a position contrary to his own?
No matter the outcome of the trial, the authors and editor of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable amounts to prepare their defenses and fight, with very uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost without the bottom of the mine.
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, are often to ruin the defenders in order to impose a settlement to the friend who will crush the opposition in addition to defraying anyone who will dare to rethink the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in the public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many countries where Barrick Gold is working, discussions in Canada are usually carried out by exchange of ideas and not by hits.
It was therefore sufficient for the mine to open its books, its files and establish a real debate through newspapers, the media, the publications and the funding of independent research teams that could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust the public opinion and rejects petition and letter of support from the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate while ignoring the views of the same public?
In the Vice-President's world, it seems that this word refers only to the lawyers who are paid a lot rather than all the Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does it first because it rejects the brutal way of the mine.
This public is willing to hear and judge Barrick, but on the basis of civilized exchange of arguments, and not as a result of what many perceive as a continuation of the belloon (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has, moreover, lodged a stay at the site of the Black Canada authors in an attempt to stop the use of that term...).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's continuation is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in block, the right to quote credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis for intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that move the world's rich businesses into a country like Canada, with repetitive prosecutions, who can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by the Black Canada authors.
She has a right to replicate.
The university environment in which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disputes and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's unbiased pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit such abuses.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agreed
The Bush administration and the congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, have finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic saving plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan aimed at curbing the financial crisis that has been draining Wall Street for months is still to be buried by both Houses of Congress.
It provides, inter alia, for better control by the electors of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for default of payment, and a right to look at the salaries paid to the directors of the securitised companies.
The US Secretary of Treasury, Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the director of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to expose the real economy and the ordinary Americans of the current Wall Street crisis," the Democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do so, trauma, chaos and disturbances on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to sprint in the last few hours in fear of the effect that would lead to a new failure on investors' mood.
The deadline for the opening of the markets this morning was the time limit.
In late negotiations, the two candidates to the US presidential election proved rather favourable to the agreement, but they failed to express their discontent that they were forced to reach this end.
Democrat Senator Barack Obama has been awarded the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including that to allow owners to keep their home and the salary of the heads of companies rescued by the State.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibleness of some, there is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the waves of American television.
Asked about another channel to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied, "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The great lines I've read [showing] that this is something we're all going to have to digest and with which we're going to be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700-billion plan aims to purchase with taxpayers' money suspicious, risky and inventable loans from US financial institutions.
It occurs after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgages (repressed) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and triggering a liquidity freeze and the disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican electors who had led the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed to be out of this impasse since the Democrats have accepted that some "toxic" assets of the companies in difficulty are only provided by the government rather than purchased.
In order to round the corners of the world in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government had to lose for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its deployment.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first instalment of 250 billion to which 100 other billion will be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion should be entered by another vote of the Congress.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will receive shares in the securitised companies that will be worth dividends to him in case of profit and that he will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the arrest procedures for housing related to the real estate loans concerned by this plan, and to set limits on the remuneration and compensation paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives from today, and to that of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have green light.
Votes have indeed continued to rise against this project yesterday, both in the Republican and Democrat camp.
"Of course Washington doesn't mean you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee, at the address of his electors.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is to benefit taxpayers."
Animator of a small group in Congress named "the Caucus of Sceptics", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, have written us to say: we are asked not to press and carefully examine the way to take it," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas indicated that it had refused to acquire its full-fledged competitor since it lost EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) in the United States' crisis of real estate loans.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of the twenty-largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not about lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In exchange, there is a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It's just something that savers and households now appreciate that times are predicting uncertainty."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Manche, the British government seemed to nationalize another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would resume all current loans at Bradford and Bringley, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander said yesterday that it would buy the UK bank's branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon committed
His beauty in today's eyes was long his up card, some will say his weakness.
Was he released from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor to the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His power, his sensitivity, and a talent that flowed from the source will also distance him from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at 83 years of age, from lung cancer in his connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the fast years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he looked and to whom he had long been a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also a apostle of the freedom and break-up of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a Jewish father of German and a Hungarian mother of origin.
These European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No self-degraded, last quality mark.
Because in him was designed a whole country with self-made man, of the Pacific war fighter, wounded to the battle, who at the beginning of the 50s studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, television, soon in the cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second at 24 hours of Mans in 1979, doubled by a six symbol, although a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow areas of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the show-business cracks also disappear with him.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has provided the vertigo to the filmmakers this weekend, while interfering with his great roles on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in permanent mutation shows through it.
Back in memory of Butch Cassidy's charm cowboy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on an appropriate burning roof by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we refer to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled at his age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone through history.
This boxer, Rocky Graziano, guilty, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Someonebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, again after his death, who actually launched Newman in 1956.
This pitiful villain in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
Billiard player in the magnificent The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), he will resume his character on the return to The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, which he valued in 1987 by his only Oscar on nine nominations.
That old-fashioned face was him.
He's still here.
The times are clumsy through its course.
Young people especially know him through George Roy Hill's cultic Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a little orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in The Hudsucker Proxy of Coen's Brothers in 1994.
With the last role of Irish Mafia's patronage in the Road to Sam Mendes' Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Against a number of legends of the film that had been loose enough early in the business, Newman will remain in the market for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its stones and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humour, "as a challenge living in "underplaying" judging his performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles have long fallen all the cooking in the bec.
However, it played less often the young than the marginals: nervous, alcoholic, salad or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the derivatives and revolts.
As a director, Newman reveals the unknown aspects of his true polite sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the main role, was drawing an end to a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his movie Harry and Son to him in 1984, working with dust and sadness.
Among the rains of men that flowed over Newman yesterday, his great partner and former gunmate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very firmly: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
In addition to his career as a legend, a great campaigner for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, Hollywood derivatives contestant also disappears.
We'll have seen a lot of his blond rotting on wine cellars, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of making bad tastes, though gag at the beginning.
However, the profits of these sales were paid to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, he'll be engaged to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here."
And a privilege for us to follow the course of an American artist so bright and so generous.
Citizen model, sum and up.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company do well in their invoice factory?
Next, on 8 October, the hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
Politicians and their accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, permanently and regularly, which has caused particularly serious damage. Other accused leaders have been held against them, such as, for example, false and false use.
According to the survey, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The state and municipalities' money, approximately 65 million HUFs in total, went on one side in the cash registers of the Fiatal Balldal movement and on the other, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to touch the money of the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices, after which no real benefits were provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they were looking for invoices in the Józsefváros market, while they were making caches in Kisunalas.
For the names of companies to be included in the invoices, it was decided, inter alia, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the deposit of the latter, he had to report pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices they were going to introduce, inter alia, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of Capital to access grants.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his partner András Õri, who, according to our information, was primarily concerned with writing the files needed to obtain the grants.
During a "survey circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place provided the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület association.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Jöv·ért Foundation, which will then bear the name of Együtt to Harmadik Évesredert, was grossly false in form and background.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, had in fact only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night. However, the bill mentioned a hundred and thirty clients.
In their accountancy, neither the name of Job Jöv·ert nor that of the Hoppa did appear, according to the information given in the parquet.
Giygz.Farkas, the manager of the company, told the hvg.hu site that when the prosecutor called him and showed him the invoices, he knew that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cache."
He added: "In addition to the form, the fact that, according to the bill, a hundred people have settled there, did not fall there anymore, as this facility only counts eleven rooms, which have not so much room.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of ferret invoices have not been more informed about Budapest travel agencies, which are part of their choice, but are only organizing travel abroad. Thus, naively, they have indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be settled in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
In addition, as appeared during the investigation, they also add VAT to these documents, while travel benefits, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Réfülöp Hotel at Jobb Jöv·ert was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. Furthermore, the hotel's employees only issue printed invoices, while the counterfeits were handwritten.
The prosecutor's investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes by mentioning as a provision the transport of goods by road, that the invoice issuing company could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
In addition, it is also for vices of forms, such as types of inappropriate invoices and false secrets, that invoices issued under the order of Együtt a Harmadi Évesredert Alapitvány, of XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehertó sports stadium, both of which deny to be the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The counterfeiters no longer paid attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was supposed to take a meal at home. According to our information, this is why the company liquidator did not issue this invoice.
Bills deliberately established
Another category of invoice issuers is the composition of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapest Alapitván Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Balldal Group - Ifju Socialisták, has set up an invoice to the Együtt Foundation at Harmadik Évesredert, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of Colllab Kft. was brought to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, he cooperated with the Zuschlags, Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices under the Jobb Jöv·ért Alapitvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the association Vörösfenny; Egyesület, for an amount of about five million HUF, but after which no benefits were actually provided.
No financial movement has taken place since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies have been careful not to mention it in their accounts.
The following category of invoice issuing companies is that of the companies directly linked to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the Director-General of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with fuel trade and motor vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where there was not found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to around 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by Cash Investment Kft. from Kisunalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a Romanian-born man, to whom Iván Kubatov would also have obtained documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices in the order of the companies Atlas, Hoppá and Együtt at Harmadik Évesredert Alapitvány, and that he blocked their counter-value.
It is precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian boys created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies worked, as the accused explained by not receiving employment.
He still serves these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the company's founding acts, he established invoices on their behalf, in the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the Atlas and Y-Generació associations.
Kubatov gave agencies, 15 total bills, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The parquet thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as VAT were in Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that were used as part of Biztos Pont's application for subsidy.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generácio and Szövetség in Modern Magyarországért introduced an application for a grant from the socialist party's public utility organization, Tancsics Mihaly Alapitvány (TMA).
They received this grant for an amount of 500,000 HUF twice, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search carried out in the Office of Arpád Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused reported on the method of making invoices, as she had already done before the prosecution.
What might be really interesting would be that the chief accused, János Zuschlag himself, decided to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his eyes are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or, if so, the Socialists would have concluded an agreement that, in exchange for the repayment of a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would only wear the hat.
Today, the latter is likely to be old-fashioned, as applications for his accommodation under surveillance, on the basis of the relief of his conditions of detention, are constantly falling into the ears of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much more damage, and the perpetrators of unreparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, await their own home the end of the procedure.
Overfill psychology: why do we spend more money?
In the course of sales, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Researchers in neurology and economics at the University of New York have been able to update the neurological and economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be separated during this type of competition, such as a sale to auctions on eBay, and that is why they prefer to pay too high a price.
These research tried to draw up a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" with the help of sales to experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lot, while the other group participated in a sale to the gaming auctions, while with the help of a functional magnetic resonance process (IRMf), researchers analyzed the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the sale of the auctions, an essential element of which is the overload of a third, the whole being under the brain trunk, called striatum, was moving intensely during the loss of the part.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "auto-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the rise of prices is explained by the escape from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economics members of this group of researchers continued to carry out financial surveillance analyses.
In these cases, three groups faced a partner, under different circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and thus they did so.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they were winning the party, then they would receive 15 additional dollars, in return.
While the third group received these 15 dollars before the auctions, the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was placed on one on victory, while on the other on failure.
By proving the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the team of players "against failure" were available for higher positions than those performed by the control group and the group "for victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any already existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them did not explain the phenomena found during sales to the auctions but by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only the methods of neurological imaging have helped to eliminate the contradiction between the two theories by now, on a third explanation." - Andrew Schotter, professor of Economic Science at the University of New York, noted.
Hepatitis: when should we consult a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
One hundred miles are estimated to be the patients carrying the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles follow a treatment. This is because the patients often do not know that they are carrying the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogens, are mainly propagated in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g. food or contaminated water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is strongly recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, generally accompanied by a bad general condition, weakness, stomach and nausea.
Then, on the skin and on the white eye a visible yellowish, the cells become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Throughout the world, every year a million people die from the most severe form of this pathology, such as cancer or hepatic cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that according to estimates, only one patient in ten receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to a cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know about the virus because pathogen destroys the liver cells in a subtle way. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular testing tests.
Pollution is much higher than the average of a population of three groups: people who had undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, 200 million patients with type C chronic hepatitis in the world are counted.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is recommended that you consult your doctor after you have observed symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
On September 30, the World Hepatitis Day was first organized by the bodies representing the four-foot disease groups in the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to the cirrhosis of the chronic liver caused by viruses, to the causes of its development and to the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would have already helped to make the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
British daily Telegraph has published an article that says that researchers at Oxford University have made an interesting experience to analyze the extent to which belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of human being.
As part of this experience for at least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electrochocs, while each observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of suffering.
Thanks to a human brain palpation technique, Catholics have also been able to activate part of their brain responsible for pain control.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments involving academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experience takes place in the following way: an instrument that emits fibers and disseminates electrochocs is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look at two paintings in a supportive way, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady at the hermine painted by Leonardo de Vinci in the 15th century.
Researchers from the origins of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of faith among believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, brought on its soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an IRM scanner, and during this time they received 20 electrochocs in four successive parts, while looking at either the painting on a religious theme or the painting on a more general theme.
The Catholics said that in the view of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "safe", as if one of them were "careful" and they were "slow, and peace invaded them".
In view of their religious theme painting, they reported 12% of their pain unless they looked at Leonard's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the experience himself, thinks that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in the athetes, provided that you find the right photo.
"We should find an image in which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, bishop of England, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, effectively change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, it is no longer the question of what would be the effect on the control of the pain of the subjects if we showed believers a Madonna painted by Leonard or a painter of the same caliber?
Would the view of a better-quality Virgin Mary produce better results?
You're what you reveal about you.
On the occasion of his tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found at the bottom of the pocket of people in the same title as the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what are their centres of interest.
However, it is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society.
While with respect to skeptics setting a parallel to Orwell's horror vision, they just don't see the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated in the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary for Google's founders to be able to meet their original purpose, which sounded as follows: "Let's gather all the world's information in a system!".
According to Google’s questioned leader, after ten years of work on global terrorism, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
To the question: What will it be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is my best job?" However, software will not be able to answer such a question, simply in the first place, that the day they will know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear for all internet users that the words used during Internet research, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then consulted by interested persons are specifically listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own history of research and can consult what they have been looking for, on what they have clicked. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, the program based on the same logic, will be able to provide a much more personalized response, and will provide us with products and services based on our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone is using my data against me, if he sees what my work is? asking users, who are worried about seeing the monopoly of Google information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can cause fear, and it is not the remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against power that can cause a counter-reaction among internet users.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases nothing protects the personal rights of internet users.
The most pressing example of these recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google has transmitted to the Brazilian government the information he had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
The people's rights-interested netizens were able to bring a sigh of relief in May, when Google, arms above with the EFF's electronic legal protection agency, proved his right to the court in front of the FBI. According to the judgement made in the future, Google will not always be forced by any of the elements of the constitution to disclose information about the secret request of the FBI, of whatever nature.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 terms of research it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years ago. But in the end, it has not been able to search the lists of private users, nor the full list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore rather contradictory: it is fueled by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of rebellion that they manifest against multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
During this time, the American geek culture and its "savage" bringing together the passionate people, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see Google the next generation of large companies, the " branched corporation", by opposition to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as the world's invasion due to Windows, and that, even though both fight for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that, contrary to Microsoft, Google does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The document code and program package, continuously refreshes, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in view of the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that the geex see very precisely the problem relationship between the rights of the person and the internet, and that the Web 2.0, the most widely proclaimed word in recent years, is just behind it.
In fact, Web 2.0 is nothing but collaboration, that we deliberately leave traces behind us, and that we use communication channels at our disposal, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essence remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other benefits, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also have blogs, where they automatically appear their most recent photo galleries that they store on Flickr or on Picasa.
While many examples can be learned, such as that of the little friend who easily understands the pictures of the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company who fired one of his employees, nothing but for the sincere views that he wrote on his blog about top management, we can be on one thing: the term of private life is entirely to be considered today.
He who lives an online life is made up of what he shows himself, and so the principle can be defined by hiding behind the behavior of young people today.
He wants to hide something, or at least he wants to try to cross the Google monopoly, he can do it (by starting with, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, without intentionally leaving any trace).
The number of people who deliberately fail to register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them is not smaller. Google online services, through text processing to image processing, to read information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not connected to huge server parks and which do not resemble our best profile, which has existed to date.
Public opinion awaits, without really hiding it, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM $140 billion), Intel $124 billion, or Coca-Cola $110 billion. AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threatens the number of advertising agencies' business, while the benefits introduced at an increasingly important rate give rise to serious migrations not only to Microsoft but to many other software creators.
However, critical observers find, on the other hand, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the top management of the company rejected, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it doubled the price of the company's mother and after the company considered it too generous the multiple daily restoration, taken at any time. All of this seems to be detracting from the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquired before the Chinese government and under the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the internal rules of society, the new services are announced only when they can be used. What is certain is that in the next months and next years, they will move the world on new points. While some believe that Google's draft scan and archiving of books and magazines is taking such important dimensions that the company will soon face the United States Supreme Court, others tremble before its health system, because in this, we can build a complete medical benefit from our previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good first substance to the next generation of science-fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half-tons orwellian, describes the future in which a man could be approached in an efficient way only through Google data.
Two minors helped to eliminate the traces of the double homicide of Ozd
"The police called two minors to question them in the double murder case of Ozd. According to the suspicions, they helped to eliminate traces of crime." - said the spokesman for the Borsod Department's department.
The young people have acknowledged the facts that have been blamed for them, and they are now being charged with complicity.
The two minors, who, according to the information from MTI (Hungarian Telecommunication Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
The complicity of killing can lead to detention up to 5 years.
The suspect of Ozd's double homicide, a 23-year-old young man, was placed in temporary detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and by interest.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old man needed a large sum of money for a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt, and that is why he will attract his creditor, on Wednesday, in a site of Ozd where he killed him, as well as the little girl of this man, who was 9 years old.
According to information from the ICT, the young man prejudged his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden in the crime scene is evidence of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the 100% purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish had made despite the fact that the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of the new potential owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99 per cent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State which wishes to separate from more than 60 per cent of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid made so far for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the stakeholders, Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the newest owner, and did not rule out that this could result in the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the paper would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance, with approximately 25 per cent of participation, followed by 14.7 per cent of the Ceská Sporitelna Bank and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, the European press's leading newspapers are already calling for "the second 11 September".
"The global financial catastrophe, we owe it to the American president" - charges the daily newspaper of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised at the war, to bring relief to a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to speak of a second September 11th.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the emissary loop in Washington.
According to El Mundo's daily vision, these are the shortcomings of the political leadership there that led the world economy on the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing every day, and then the whole world is going to pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, after the congress vote, a real dangerous threat, which Washington does not propose as a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the biggest transformations takes place.
We can't ignore the threat any longer - the Tags-Anzeiger de Geneve points out.
Some states may still have a life jacket for their financial institutions, and thanks to the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if more banks collapse such dominoes, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long run, we need the European Union states to do little about their national selfishness and to centralise control over the divided financial markets.
On Monday, the weak financial institutions received more than EUR 100 billion - recalled the Vienna daily Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers will also have to hand over to the pocket, very deep, similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really taken care of the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses, partly, the old continent.
The "saviours" must not immediately burn a hundred billion euros, so it would be fair if they noticed in which case it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing further damage.
The Smart Car Imitates the Flights of the Bourdon
What method would be better to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if it is not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
For example, the one with the bees.
In the amazing project presented at the CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the Burdonian bees gave the strategic idea of leaving the engineers at Nissan to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacles detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot, a bio-inspired auto-robotized system, of type BR23C, which he equipped with bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
In its flights, each bee is its own space, in oval form, which, in fact, looks much like our safe protective helmet - explained, at the exhibition, Kazuhiro Doi, the director of the department of research and development and technological public relations of the brand.
The bee facet eye plays a key role, since it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the facet eye functions, engineers have considered the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles in a 180-degree angle and at a distance of 2 metres in front of the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the ship's microprocessor, which transforms it into an immediate process.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a second fraction. Then, the mini robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from a sufficient angle to avoid collision.
In contrast to any existing system at present, this avoiding manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
"If not, the mini robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotized car project.
It must respond instinctively and instantly, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and the most internal layer of the protection envelope, a layer where the collision is currently considered inevitable.
All this process must reflect what bees do to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that have the bees to avoid the other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotary movement, acceleration and slowing as manoeuvres at the disposal of the mini robot
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and whose energy concentration is larger, making their life longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is primary, not data processing, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should treat only a few incoming signals per second, and respond to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. Thus, it uses only a few dozen kilo-octets of continuous memory.
There is no need for memory of a giga-octets capacity, or even mega-octets.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology used for instant avoidance. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will make its entry into the series cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its integration into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his path.
We even gave the baby a name out of price.
The written version of the 700 billion-dollar economic savings plan, which aims to purchase suspicious bank loans, and to use several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that in the course of new debates extending until midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, Congress leaders have agreed on disputes that have existed for days and days, around the rescue plan of a total amount of 700 billion dollars.
"We have taken a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, after which it is no longer left to put agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
The U.S. Secretary of Treasury Henry Paulson said by commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question, here, about the saving of Wall Street, but about turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8:00 p.m., Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2:00 p.m., at the local time of Central Europe), but did not result in a spectacular rise in the stock market.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in the name of the emergency economic stabilisation law of 2008. Then its fate will be between the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress made tonight, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesperson of the White House.
In addition, the different programme from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which it mentioned that the $700 billion had to be spent only once for the purchase of securities on suspicious credits.
In the meantime, up to half of the sum of 700 billion can be spent, the first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the Congress has passed the law, probably on Monday. This first amount will be used by the Treasury Secretary to purchase suspicious bank claims, while the use of the $100 billion additional will be left to the discretion of the President.
The programme will be supervised by an independent agency, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
Under the Law, the Treasury secretariat will be able to put in place a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to buy suspicious claims, securities on suspicious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The department's competent persons stated that the purchases may take place in the context of a sale to the auctions, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to participate in an insurance programme, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools of concern for which companies will have paid an equivalent premium to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provided the necessary tools to spend $700 billion on the urgent needs of the financial system, that it was the large purchase of suspicious claims, insurance, or the risk of seeing the system leading to the collapse of one or the other important financial institution.
"We will take the necessary provisions to be prepared for the application of the law as soon as it is signed" - he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders who are in bad positions and awaiting State aid can expect that their starting benefits, called simply parachutite for extra-Atlantic purposes, will be ceilinged by the government.
The ceilinging of wages is mentioned only in specific cases. Moreover, the limitations depend on how the Treasury secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The principle of ceilinging means that if the Treasury Secretariat purchases in the context of a sale to the auctions, they will receive an excess tax on the dured parachute, unless the discredited bank president participates in retirement.
Directly after the purchase of suspicious claims, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not excessive.
In order for the image to be complete, it is still necessary to add that the existing gold parachutes are not modified. The ceiling only concerns the new contracts, which is to motivate the participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in effect on the appointments of the Directors-General - the chairman of the Committee on the Financial Services of the House of Deputies, Democrat Barney Frank, commented.
In addition, the State has a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they may even be winning in the case as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved will fall back on their beds.
The draft law states that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal which will determine how the losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That is not why American citizens have ordered us, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Member of California Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur, thinks it's the same as taking action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to increase

The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials have resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the manufacturing sector of chemicals and products (1.6 per cent).
This has resulted in a decline in the oil processing sectors (1.4 per cent), in the manufacture of machinery and electrical equipment (0.9 per cent), and in a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry recorded an increase of between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which represent an important weight in national industrial exploitation, prices have increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in the gas price introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, these are the prices of the oil processing sector that have experienced the most significant increase (32.4%).
In the manufacture of metallurgical products, an increase in prices of 13.2 per cent was observed, while in the important area of food, beverages and tobacco production, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price reductions were made in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of machinery and electrical appliances (0.3 per cent).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6 per cent to 9.1 per cent.
In the transformation industry as a whole, prices increased by 10.2 per cent during the past year.

In the sectors of production of consumer goods, inflation was measured at 6.8 per cent, while in the profit-initiating sectors it was reduced by 1.4 per cent.
Sales prices in the industrial sector in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they decreased by 3.9 per cent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment fell by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, and 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that by January 12, the US-Hongrois visa exemption agreement will enter into force. This is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to it, "now everything depends only on the time when the extra-Atlantic electronic access and control systems will be put into service."
All the time, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visas, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will return the decoration of the Commander Cross with the Star of the Order of merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of the candidates to the presidency, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank's rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, as well as John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, supported the 700 billion-dollar government's rescue plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary of Treasury.
After the marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives of Congress and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday at dawn, that they had concluded principle agreements on the bank's rescue plan.
This funding plan, with the aim of eliminating the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even appear, each as more fit than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, with the introduction of economic issues, Obama has again managed to make some progress. McCain's advance, with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a colister just after the Republican Convention, was founded.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly vote for the 700 billion rescue law.
He stressed that the proposal contained consumer protection passages, which he also supported.
"It is now necessary to act, with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
There was no lack of qualifications for McCain's economic ideas of over-exceedings.
In an interview given to the ABC channel, McCain said: "We will all have a hard time finding it (...) but doing nothing is not a possible way."
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal mentioned the creation of a Treasury Control Committee and the ceilinging of the starting allowances of senior managers, and that it was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role on the ground in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there was serious hope that the House would vote on the bill as of Monday.
The German-language press review
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - it is as well as the mention of the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
The mirror (speel.de)
In the online edition of the German-left information magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic loss of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this well-known politician, CSU's erosion began well before the sad Duke Beckstein-Huber took on his duties.
Christian Socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now, these same modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely to have been completed, just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party has ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU collected 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the so-called Stoiber election.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization of "depleting its parents", established in the region in a consistent manner by the CSU.
It was 40 years ago that sociologists announced this, but they were greatly confused about the pace. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans in the north and east in the Bavarian region, in full development, could not be left unaffected by the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization is in line with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more inclined.
It is also surprising that during the last few weeks, that is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have rather distanced themselves from the CSU, such as the independents, the artisans, the bacca holders and the graduates of higher education.
In these groups, CSU support decreased by 40 per cent.
The Press (depresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With Whom? The presidents of the party are on the reserve to deal with the questions of the coalition", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the confused internal policy that was established after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ wanted to discuss with the conservatives of the EVP.
The EVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations. Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now all around the coalition; during public television debates, party leaders were hardly allowed to read their cards.
Werner Faymann, President of the SPÖ, confirmed that he would like to discuss with the OVP.
SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is effectively possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would think of a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the OVP, as vice-chairman, remains open on Faymann's side.
As he mentioned it, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replication of this combination is out of question.
Multiterer responded with caution to red proposals.
As he has already said, cooperation will certainly be ineffective if Faymann tries to get involved in the internal affairs of the UFO.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is currently an open question, and these points must be debated in the WFP.
Jörg Haider, president of BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities" - said Haider.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, whose host is France, has begun in Paris as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregations in education, because it is a violation of the law that affects the most Roma children and therefore one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MP Fidesz Popular Party, Járóka prevented Roma from disappearing from the labour market in the first place as a result of their low qualifications.
"A vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary degrees, and as a result of an elementary education of poor quality, only a small part has the opportunity to obtain a higher degree of education."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role when it comes to asserting other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the European Parliament, there is a need to raise awareness of these reports in the broadest possible circle, including between Roma and non-Romas.
Indeed, early on, a Roma child starts school, increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"Because of their nationality in the European Union, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education, and protected from poor quality and sectoral education." - said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, cooperation from the European Union towards a goal and action is necessary for the immediate acceleration of the school de-growth process, and for this reason compliance with the existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of primary importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken; the opportunities provided by democracy must be given to Roma children, so that they can participate as citizens of the right to the future of Europe" - Járóka demanded.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities, which is ensured for all, the objective of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities organised each year since the Berlin Summit last year is to provide a unique platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: Thank you for a transition period
The decision on the fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo will be taken in October.
Despite this pitiable electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been adjourned.
The party president, Erwin Hube and the regional government leader, Günther Beckstein, can still hold their place. The question is to know how long grace will last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a 17 percent loss of catastrophic vote, will be on the agenda of the extraordinary party's congress, held last weekend in October.
In any case, the members of this highly criticised couple felt that they were not particularly at their seat.
As a result, they have been used to calm the angry members of the division and base, which one day after the "bavarous tsunami" have demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the push against Stoiber, it remains only 43.4% of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU has been the "only sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18% of German GDP.
But conservatives are still very strong in this region of the south, of key importance for the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a seat in this modest recognition group, which began discussions with the FDP Liberals, as well as with the Libres electors, trained along the right values, regarding any coalition of the Munich government.
A strange nine foot of fate was that with the help of the list of Libres electors, the Gabriele Pauli came into legislation, whose action against Stroiber served as the possibility of pussch carried out by Duo Huber-Beckstein, to then treat the very ambitious municipal political woman without a home.
Now, CSU leaders put all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far would pull the hooks in the reels, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, appointed September 28 as the most beloved day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber launched some quick remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
As a result of the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel can only be chancellored once again, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, because of the difficulty in hiding its disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of the CSU's land will not adversely affect the great coalition of Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the socio-democratic crisis is always lasting.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - its rivers : 110 - 0
No opposition MP joined the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which ensures its prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by the illegalities committed when the votes are being cast.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation made up of 110 people in that country of 10 million people has been very opposed for decades before yesterday's elections, the opposition joining its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) would seriously hope that Lukashenko, renewing his presidential mandate for the fourth time during the questionable elections, would "allow" this time the presence of a few members of the opposition to Parliament as a result of the amendment of the Constitution in 2006.
In this way, the ODSZ has given up on its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, depending on Russia's economic growth, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where, due to the well-qualified Belarusian policy order of anti-democracy, Lukashenko and several senior politicians do not receive entry visas, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus has to take credit for the reduction of Russian natural gas imports, which has thus contributed to the transition of Beltransgaz, the owner of gas pipelines across the country, to the Russians.
The fact that at the time of the campaign's evaluation, the OSCE emphasized positive changes rather than shortcomings, such as the ban on a third of the opposition candidates, referred to a prior settlement.
However, the OSCE communiqué on Monday already contested the campaign, during which the essence of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present when the votes were dropped.
Despite this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize the Ossetia of the South and Abazzia separated from Georgia. Or, Russia with which Belarus has formed a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been started between Belarus and the EU" - Alexandre Milinkevich said in our journal.
According to the candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this should remain, although "the power in this parliament which has no weight has been feared to make even one opponent enter".
The opposition does not provide for protests in the light of the results. Instead, it tries to get its message on the need for economic reforms from voters.
"Of course, we are very concerned about this: we have to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put us in the wheels for what is broadcast, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of older people," said MilinKevich, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of the most officially supported pensions does not really consider it appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'decreasing the silence of a cemetery', is no more than a matter of time" - Milinkevich believes.
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers qualified for democratic elections.
Serguei Lebedev, head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in deeds." Thus, the absence of opposition is only evidence of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had we had no turning doors for the entrance and exit of the employees.
But from today, this new measure is in force against the small malts, against which it points and then drinks the coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-fraud novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The Brunetta-related rotary doors are an instrument for better working, with more productivity, more presence and more services," says the Minister.
Now a new season of responsibility and transparency begins.
"It's reformism" also points out Brunetta.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of turning doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, assures the Secretary-General: "It is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, less breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution."
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
from Rome, the Minister states that "in three months, the absences of public employees' disease have decreased by 50%, or 60 million workers more than a year."
And it adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "of which wage dynamics - explains the Minister - these past 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees were united to challenge the rules of the Brunetta Decree, which were used in the Codacons.
" whereas the Minister of the Public Service today has the data on the reduction of absenteeism in the workplace for the cause of illness, the association of consumers - the people of the "active workers" continue to increase.
In Italy, thousands of employees of the right and productive public administration met to declare war on the illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, there is an objection to the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of infirmity due to service; the extension of the hours of the hours of permanent residence of the sick worker, during which checks are carried out and other aspects contained in the Minister's new provisions.
Accidents on the place of work, Napolitano: "Creative Prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, the Inail data confirmed that the whites were approximately 1,200.
Figures testify to the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw attention to the institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic aspect, Anmil today celebrates the 58th National Day of Labour Accident Victims, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data released by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of these last days, confirm the importance of the issue of prevention at the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association of Mutiles and Invalids at Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the continued joint efforts to prevent job accidents, the protection of workers, assistance to victims' families and awareness of public opinion"
"naturally angry, everyone has hit the ping to put an end to such tragedies that, by their size, trigger the media cry and public opinion participation, even though the daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide only "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
Many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to keep our attention to this phenomenon, not to evaluate the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini House stressed how much" this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes upon all institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly."
The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white people being killed from being impressive,” said Anmil Pietro Mercandelli's president.
"We do not want this "tendence to the low" to be translated, in fact, into a minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention relaxes, that happens to the tragedy.
"we believe that, in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"We believe that more controls and inspections are needed, as is a more important intervention on the training of workers, and so on from school."
- He added: "There is still an effort to communicate and raise public awareness.
"But above all, there must be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
" Mercandelli has then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions of protection of the compensation provided for the victims of work" and "the aid to which the system has been directed in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the insurance guarantee – has he added – so that the fate of the person who has an accident should not depend on spontaneousism or the enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 player with fingertips, they risk hearing.
Listening to full-volume music for a longer period using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers may cause permanent injury to the audience.
This is what the European Commission, which, in a communiqué published in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks of the EU (Csseri), published today.
"of this scientific report - we read in the note - 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than an hour per day and per week, are at risk of permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that a large number of young people who often use portable musical devices and mobile phones in full volume can inadvertently damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific data indicate that the responsible is at clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make public information available.
In addition, we need to review existing systems of control in the light of scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and can monitor new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"Scientists-conclusion the Executive U- Confirms that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable and similar musical devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of musical devices to 100Db, but the concern increases with regard to auditory damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as lower levels and noise exposure time.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceed the current limits for maximum noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for extended periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This affects 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 million and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germany ordered the Commission to leave for the future of capital.
Today we begin, in March we end, in June we will take the sums.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Thermes de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they have finished, the Committee and the Community Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official " timbre of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - it wishes to stress Germano - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome that political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Community Council, will be able to use.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a large project for Rome.
In March, it will have completed its tasks and will then disappear, as this experience must have a precise period of time.
In June we will present the strategic plan from the work carried out by the Commission on the Future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary, given that its views will not be binding, Germany repeats: "Everything depends on the work which the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as elsewhere in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics is driven by daily management and by time-consuming emergencies.
On the contrary, we want to see it in advance, and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
Furthermore, the mayor of Rome would like to point out that "this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Romanian citizens, and will serve to study and participate in the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Germany, in fact, "a draft of strategic reference, whether firm or immovable, is necessary in order to allow our city, to improve, what it needs absolutely, while thinking about its future now a unitary mind,".
A future that, as the Mayor of Rome states, "will not be limited to the usual Community borders, but that will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president, that's why.
"Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the basis of his decisions, destroyed the US economy and made reports (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks against Obama are increasing as the date of the elections approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition."
Obama is truly cultivated: he believes he will win the highest position of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these are attacks that don't say much; they are obviously racial attacks, and they don't answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, who all said that Obama will win and with good advantage.
In this case, it's still someone who talks to the heart and not to the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the suburbs of the south of the United States, wrote an article: once in the polling booth, we know well who the American patriot will vote for.
This is what emerges from an aspect of American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Tell me what you want, we'll see ourselves putting the cross, Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things have never been revealed so far, so much so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was returned to its homes at foot.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to make the suitcases.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's weakness point.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge deal to do.
Usesa, the economic turmoil is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for deletions. And many charge the Internet, this "killer" of the newspaper paper.
Five hundred U.S. journalists were questioned by the POW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they have not openly declared information attachments, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destructive economic model crisis.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work at the newspaper assembly, are a major problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if traditional journalism is wanted to be understood by the general public, it will not be reduced accordingly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a bad path.
Locally, the executive group is 65 per cent.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists don't mind seeing where the web goes.
The largest publishing houses spread a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as "the killer" of the newspaper paper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to the technology hoping that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest crack in American journalism is between those who run the newsrooms - that is, the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is related to "working safety".
Directors who are planning to lose their 3-year-old job are 47% at the national level.
With regard to journalists, we are going to 30%.
The "sure work" at staff level (nos editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a vast nation such as Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
The directors receive almost always large wages, while the editor can earn $10 million a month, in addition to pension and insurance payments.
With regard to holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days at all, a number of years passed.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "malades" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:TriBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPOLA STANDARD.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the estate agent Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
Coppola is surveyed for bank routes as part of the Unipol-Bnl scale instruction.
During his trial in charge last week, he had obtained the establishment of compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the real estate agent be able to travel from the province to a capital dwelling.
According to the court, such movements (which were not granted by the PM) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that he was receiving.
The elite are in danger.
The phenomenon had already shown itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the 700 billion-dollar rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and it is even more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times yesterday that confirms that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided among its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "the Washington" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, quite rightly, who felt despotic with the vote I was speaking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is an example of the changes, of the major changes that the current economic earthquake pre-announces or leaves already running: not only in the United States, but in the whole West, and it can only be here.
In the United States as well as in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the phenomenon covered for a while, so that, in the new climate, it strengthens and reveals itself.
The first of these phenomena is the revitalization, the extraordinary resumption, of the dual category of sovereign state, compared to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions that, of course, have close relations with the foreign, but which, above all, are largely involved, the balance sheets of people and families living in one country, in one state or another.
This immediately creates a political problem for the government: it is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost national.
Political internationalisation really seems to be out of play or not a big deal to say: the clear evidence is provided by the European Union, which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot decide any common policy line.
And so, it is from the government of each state that everyone is waiting for interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all for a credit condition: when we go through a difficult period, there is only the States that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements of which no market or international organization will ever have the same availability.
This new phase of the state-nation crisis is of the utmost importance that the most recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a sufficient factor linked to this: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, ever more sophisticated technology, non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we realized at once, that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with the things that are not material enough, such as water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but which are absolutely linked to a limited space, to a territory.
So, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the evil to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now arrive at the second novelty, which, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably said Policy, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergences.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, there is a distortion of discretion for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved themselves inadequate and full of shadow zone.
In addition, something deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discriminating, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of distance that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
This increases the conviction of the different classes, before actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far as they are apoges, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, having the same time, and being ever more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, which feeds underground, a powerful and branched movement of delegations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, manifested in the "revolving" improvised electoral elections or, in the changes in collective moods of recent times, from the conservative ascent in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of the workers in Britain, to the rebellion of American congressors against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy is not by chance).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their intellectual credentials, their formats, looks like someone, have more and more difficulties, which is not today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and acts in a potentially immeasurable manner.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "mass revolt" on the agenda seems to be exaggerated.
But we say well, keeping your eyes open, that's not without reason.
The supercool to walk on the walls.
Vain the laws of gravity through a super-collar and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various U.S. research centres, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring hardly two inches [2.5 cm] square, the researchers managed to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
The U.S. Science magazine published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular structure of carbon, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of the neck can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a spaghetti pile." explains Zhong Lin Wang from Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by geckos pads, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the patches of these reptiles, and at the same time that it "extends easily from the wall", explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton University of Engineering.
MARCHER ON THE MURS? –"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Could it be to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since the nano carbon tubes are drivers of heat and electric current.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
For now, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also committed to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California researchers presented a microfibre adhesive as hair, which cleans up dust during the movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adherence.
Medicinal products: never with fruit juices.
Attention to the grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly during the summer because they are harmful and rich in vitamins, if they are associated with certain vital medicines, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing, as appropriate, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices that they are, in box or fresh, whether they are associated with the introduction of certain medicines; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: it is sufficient for a glass of cotton juices, oranges and apples to reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines, nullifying their beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
Pamplemous juice has already been strongly criticized because it is held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stamine and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR DISPOSAL OF UNUSED MEDICINAL PRODUCTS OR WASTE MATERIALS DERIVED FROM SUCH MEDICINAL PRODUCTS, IF APPROPRIATE
NOT THAT PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit medications.
Long is the list of active principles inhibited by pamplemous and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the University of Milan: "These findings are generally, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that need to change the information notes of the medicines.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the medicines taken, and, if something is not clear, do not get impressed, but contact the doctor or pharmacist clearly," the expert pointed out to Ansa.
The Nobel Prize for the Economy in Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize for the Economy was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Kyennesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's solutions to the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that casts off many controversyes, which has been repudiated to the economist for years, but which has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a very aggressive-style distributor, particularly critical of the excess liberalism of Bush administration.
Open Office, here's the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package.
It's the day of OpenOffice.org.3.0's release, the open source of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost a year, carried out by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package shows itself to the general public with various innovations: the welcome screen, and the revised and become less austerity interface, to others more important, such as compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, certain functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphics development module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
On this front, it is still possible to create "Hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format graphics to the elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
The collaboration between several individuals is an element that has had several improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet of calculation, several users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on modifications, in the drafting of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to carry out some of the functions of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should issue the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htm and is added to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available as usual for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD may be shipped to the home or at the place of work.
And if the free theme can be a way to spread it in the homes, it is just in business, that the Open Office then tries the big challenge, which can already rely on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Apart from the realities that provide training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the equivalent written video of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet to replace Excel; Impress, for the rival presentations of PowerPoint;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphics module.
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are nearly 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected number
Kohl also, it's positive, it's the fourth case of doping.
New case of positiveness in the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best climber's mall.
This is the website of the daily The Team that reports the news.
At 26 years of age, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the third generation Epo, after Italians Ricardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl's samples are part of the tests carried out in the last few weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positive in Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to wait for two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positive in the third generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, informed the Austrian authorities of the positive.
The 26-year-old Austrian was placed on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastrre and American Cadel Evans, thus rubbing the top of the best climber.
IMMIGRES: NEW YORK TIMES IF ITALIE IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of immigrants has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reticence.
Would this turn the Beau country into a nation of racists? That's what the New York Times is interested in, which has devoted a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, referring to the case of young Abdul William Guibre, who was born in Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "north paradox": the Nordic regions are both where we record" more integration and more work," but also "a strong anti-immigrant feeling of the country and the most important support to the North League"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also referred to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Even the new legislation required by the Lega to stop immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
A trend highlighted by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, at his meeting with Benoît XVI in the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to conquer racism."
Students who are victims of cheap rent, up to 900 euros for a room.
The rental market for students did not know a crisis
According to Sunia's latest survey, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects of the exclusion of whole categories of young people, the right to study due to very high global costs that families of origin must support - explains the head of Sunia's study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the strong demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of generalized growth has begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, no rent limit, sublocations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through tax revision are needed to calm prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, there is a minimum of 650 euros (Black Bande zone), an average value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, an average cost bed, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the nearby areas of the University, it takes EUR 250/280 for a double bed, and between 370 and 500 for a single room.
In Rome, close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), around 600 euros are requested for a single, 450 for a double bed.
Values slightly lower (EUR 550 for a simple) for the areas close to other universities (Osteense and Cinecittà).
It can only be saved if you move away in the peripheral areas:300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a simple one in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes EUR 300/400, for a simple one, it costs EUR 400 to 600, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for bed, there must be at least 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, the cities such as Perugia, in which the rentals are often taken by extra community students, have a further anomaly: the rent requested by foreign students is increased by 25/30 per cent compared to that applied to Italians.
Bye-bye to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities feed on the historic halls.
The historical cinema halls are fermented in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the stager Giuseppe Tornatore shows well what is happening in the major Italian urban centres, but also in the provinces,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of large multi-rooms, and the death of the consumption of mono-rooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems unelectable and unquestionable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and charged with memory, "it's as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a piece of road and so much emotion," observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, a film offering to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, who told the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia in a way of living the movie, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, mean everything: these past five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the halls of the main cities that paid the costs mainly: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine is headed with 82 single rooms lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the event of the multiplex, as these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-story cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardy over the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observed Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should still ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a room closes in a city, these frequencies are not all necessarily willing to go to multiplex.
Not to mention the missing deliberation of the credit for traders: the State's previous debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is a shame that, from a ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not comply with existing laws.
To support the sector, between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, worried about these closures, has decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mary and Anec, the first such in Italy, to defend and promote mono cinemas in historical and peripheral centres.
Among the regulations envisaged, there are tax incentives for managers and benefits for the mobility public: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking and in certain parking.
"It is an initiative that I am pleased to see," observed Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is obvious, however, that, in contrast to the superpower of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Paradise cinema" which I had been thinking of for 10 years.
I've been going to Rome for 25 years, and when I go to Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I've lived so much with shared emotions, I'm on the other side, so I don't see the dark panels through the dust.
Relations between politics and ‘andrangetta, arrested Major of Gioia Tauro.
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to harmonize the Mary's choices in the interests of the Piromelli clan."
heavy charges are launched by the magistrates of the Antimafia Directorate of Calabre, towards the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrene, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competitions for Mafie Association.
The mannets also for Gioacchino Piromelli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his little lawyer's son, homonymous of the boss, are already convicted of associating mafieus-type villains, as well as paying 10 million euros.
"a face to legal and moral norms, and especially good sense," the prosecutors wrote, both local administrations expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with Master Piromelli.
"This would have been given to the clan - writing the judges - to officially enter the matrimonial chambers facilitating the opportunities, already considerable, of control and direction of the public administration"
The chairman of the Agazio Loiero Regional Committee of the Calibrian Region, only hides "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the Andangheta, the heroes who are honest"
The arrests this morning followed those of last July, after which the police announced that they had decapitated the Pyromalli clan.
By the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always due to alleged conditions between organised crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their duty to administer the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, was appointed head of a right-centre coalition, after the May 2006 Ballotage.
He created the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the vice-minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, the accused of having handled the whole issue for a political matter, but given the request for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromelli clan had even succeeded in requesting the variation of the A3 project.
On the basis of the pre-ordered interceptions against Dal Torrene, the pm wrote, "the availability to marry the demands of a business man, representing a more well-known group, near the Pyromalli, uniforming the choice of public administration in the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born of waves, now the bigs are released.
This is an unparalleled plant that occupys more than 70% of the planet's surface and now large global energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colossus like Chevron put their eyes, and now they're trying to put their hands on it.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimated in 2007, that 15% of the global electricity need could be covered by sea-wheel operating systems.
This quantity would be double that produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides..
Colosseums on the attack.
Enersis, the first maritime power plant to be built in 2005, signed an agreement to build an installation in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, a real revolutionary step would have been said.
Two years ago, more and more candidates among these companies have always been dedicated to traditional energy on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying the technologies on ocean energy" said the spokesperson of a company associated with the U.S. oil collapse, the Wall Street Journal's economic daily, and it assesses the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question relates to the granting of a permit by the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered that precisely in Alaska, the US continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which travels the way of energy coming from the sea, and the amounts invested so far, although their details are not known, indicate, according to observers, a growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are still talking about technology at its beginning, because marine energy does not dissipate fear of the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small and do not seem to create major problems in the ecosystem.
In order to produce large-scale energy, however, technologies must be used with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of bows connected to each other.
The push of the waves, which moves the holes up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure causes a turbine to turn around, feeding a generator.
Energy is sent to the shore through cables under the sea.
For the moment, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and part of the energy could serve a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already producing energy for a commercial centre and parking using six turbines under the seas of the East River of New York.
The movement of water at sea, turns the pitches of turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced having a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to power.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, deserves the potential of sailors at this time.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable of the wind, the sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it's just about the energy of sailors that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look to the coast, invested $7 million in 2008 and plans investments up to 35 million in 2009.
