What's he doing? ČSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or sugarcane
A new city council from ČSSD will have to overcome a certain language barrier, according to everything, so that they can understand their senior colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the representative.
Diník Aktuálno.cz members of the new council of the ČSSD "explored", as they know notorically introduced slang, which occurred on the council during the last years when Prague ruled the present coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which was introduced by the Prague political messiah during the previous era by Prime Minister Paul Bém, describes some of the most famous figures, situations, and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that new council concepts were not understood too well.
At least they say so.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm in Prague politics more than a novel," responded to a "kmotrovski" dictionary's test for the culture of Lukas Kaucký.
And as far as the political veteran was concerned, so did Councilman Karel Brézin.
It's like a golf jacket.
"It's the only expression you're presenting to me that I sometimes use."
"I don't generally know a snake."
From the dictionary, whose phrases of the journal Aktualno.cz published this year in June before the ODS election congress, she chose the editors of six examples, mostly those that are notorically linked to the Prague magistrate.
The Socialists were supposed to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "to go to the sugarcane", "the bull's shirt", "the betrayal of the capital" and "to teach".
Three of the councillors agreed, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to be head of the Prague school in the future - promised first the interview, but later he did not answer the phone.
The fifth councillor Petr Dolinek rejected a fair test.
"I'm not going to solve these things at all, and I'm not going to evaluate the way the citizens are doing."
"I am now deciding how we will understand within our programmes," he responded.
As already noted, the Councilman Lukas Kaucký would not have found out in the title that it was about the influential entrepreneur and friend of the exploding speaker Bém Roman Janouskov.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to him, and the only term that he guessed correctly in the experiment is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's Blanka's tunnel," he says, and he immediately adds, "But I know it from the news."
"I'm going to have to pay for some language courses," she yells.
The golf course, then, as a blank tunnel, decouples not only the matador Karel Březina, but also the environment counselor Lukas Plachý.
Both social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lucas Plachém is aware of where to find this figure - the sense of the expression "to go to the sugar shop".
"I mean to go to some Prague business," is a terrible close to saying that it's about Janoušk's company seat.
In agreement with Brezina, she recalls that the knowledge of the nebula was more of a novel than the use of such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the frequency of the test, there is no similar dictionary of slang expressions.
"I've had a good time with my colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
"We call ourselves names, sometimes the names are short and the names are used," says the President of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulinský, whose customers are nicknamed Hulda.
"In school they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," she admits to her own nickname Karel Březina.
The current name has been tested and operated.
Council Weinert is for the parties Grandpa or less friendly Grandpa, the representative Miroslav Poche, who pointed out the frauds in the party's sponsorship before the elections, has the nickname "Game".
The nicknames are also the only thing that social democrats in the domestic talk allow.
The Hulda Huld is not happy to hear, but the newspaper Aktuálno.cz noted another nickname of this Prague President.
"Doctor of Coach Law" reminds us that Petr Hullínský won his title JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "miracles", issued a brochure
Women declared in Burkina Faso have several common characters.
They belong to an older generation, they cannot engage in work for example for health reasons, they are free and they have no children.
The one who becomes a witch is sent to isolation to keep the rest of the village safe.
"The man of this fate is only very rare."
"There are no young healthy women, because they are helping with work and giving birth to children," says a regular sister who is taking care of more than a hundred women in a special home in the capital city of West Africa in Burkina Faso.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measures".
She published an information brochure that should help the witch hunt to limit it.
It's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," noted Die Standard's paper newspaper.
The charge of witchcraft is common in other African countries as well.
In Ghana, which is neighboring to Burkina Faso, Amy Hemmah died two and a half decades ago last week after three women and two men tortured her, oiled her and burned her.
The BBC server reported the case.
The Pachatels claim it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman had an oil that was used for ritual anointing.
He was asleep after the group wanted to "get out of the evil spirit".
The isolation of "miracles" supports people regardless of the level of education achieved.
Dinik Der Standard quoted a twenty-four-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "People's spirits were always in danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, he was trying to reduce the government's trade fair, he was still the president himself in Gambia last year.
"The Gambian President Jammí, after his aunt's death, set up an extensive hoon at a witch's house, who allegedly had to share in her death and try to kill the president himself by means of black magic."
"He called upon the shamans from nearby Guinea, who, along with the police, soldiers and the President's personal protection, violently dragged randomly selected men and women from the Gambian villages to the president's farm in Kanila," said Amnesty International in his report.
On the farm, people had to drink herbal medicine with hallucinogenic effects that also caused stomach and kidney problems.
Two prisoners didn't survive on the farm.
After international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were finally released for freedom.
Bacal's tenant: Burn in stones, higher rent signed
The senior subordinate man walked out of the door of the customer centre of RPG Apartments "uhlobarona" Zdeňka Bakaly, the largest private owner of properties in Czech Republic.
Under guard he carried a file and in it a new lease to three flats: his daughter and his son, who is in execution of the sentence.
All three of them just took the rent.
Instead of 3500 a month, the son will pay for 2+1 second category 4100 crowns from next year.
"And there's no hot water and it has to be warmed by the petrama (stones on solid fuel, known as red)," shows a man's finger in his son's new contract, on which he has full power.
"But I signed it," explains half-inflicted and half-infidel.
The BytyOKD.cz Civil Society, which has designated new terms as "uncorrected and unbalanced", advises tenants not to sign a new contract and wait until December 7th, when a public statement of how to deal with it.
But the man has a hand over it.
"One says it, the other says it," he goes dark.
Ostrava is becoming a major deregulation laboratory.
After New Year's, a large majority of apartments in the Czech Republic are waiting for non-market rent.
Currently, therefore, it was decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
Havířůvská čekára RPG is one of four in Ostrava and on Tuesday 9 a.m. it is already full.
The security agency shall be immediately provided by the door and shall be provided with a means of communication.
"Rent 2011", lights a special button on his touch screen.
One tick and a piece of paper will be taken out of the machine with a number.
You can't even read "157" and your number is already piping on a large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
In half a second, you're in line.
After a moment of rent, an older couple comes to ask, but new rentals are obviously not involved in the waiting room.
Most people have come to solve common problems such as other - requests for repair, insurance and so on.
Letters with new rental contracts are received in Ostrava by most tenants of a total of 44 thousand RPG's portfolio almost half of November.
RPG Estates in their letters suggest an increase of between 15 and 38 percent.
A special transfer to new rentals was opened at the customer centre on 18 November.
"It runs over the week, so it's just in the race," the workers respond to the shift after a moment of variation when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mountain apartments are local exciting themes.
Before the elections, he was quite horrified by the vice-president of parliament and the island's cousin Lubomír Zaorálek from the ČSSD, and even now he is filled with local newspapers.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"No post..or a desk in the toilet has not been exchanged for me," the man mentioned at the outset said.
According to employees, pensioners are coming to see if they can get a discount from the rent if they sign on time when RPG promises them in a special offer.
A half-way discount for February's rent will also be received by other tenants who will sign the new contract by December 15.
Havier's "deregulation" pass, but questions are definitely not paid.
"Out of the 360 customers last night for the 2011 rent, there were only about forty to fifty people," the workers estimate as a surplus.
At the same time, on the web and its walls, RPG proposes an individual meeting of contracts where it will be needed.
However, if both parties do not agree to rent, an independent court will have to determine it.
"It is not a threat, but information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," the RPG points out on its pages.
"No one will be judged here," one of RPG Byty's employees thinks, and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her part of the truth.
"I have 13,000 income and I have five thousand left for food, I don't have to judge," he says.
But the workers will only get away with it.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek tells them in the media not to sign, so people probably wait," he thinks.
The rental regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with New Year 2011 and according to the RPG Byty, it is an economic necessity to increase it.
"The existing rent is still not enough for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the resident portfolio of RPG Housing, that the very angered tenant of the housing fund is, according to homeowners, the main reason for the increase in rents.
While for five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs could invest in apartments of four billion, for four years from 2011 to 2014, this is expected to be 5.2 billion.
A large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the pillowed seats of the Havierian waiter so far repeats a number of redly highlighted information.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31 200 flats, which is more than 90% of RPG flats."
"And it will always be the largest of 7,50 CZK per square meter and month," appears on the screen.
Only 400 flats from the RPG portfolio will be rented by 38 percent.
"In these cases, there is an increase of an extremely low amount of 19,66 CZK per square metre," RPG points out.
2600 apartments will remain the same for next year's rent.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not result in a jump, but will be spread within four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see graph) gives the company back to the apartments, mainly to heat savings - new windows and heating.
They're supposed to be getting people to sign an agreement to increase rents.
The office also has a school, and the architects understand it.
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new residence of Arch.Design.
No one would expect him to also hide a minivan with everything that belongs to it - with colourful walls, fancy furniture, to buy toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch.Design employees have been able to visit her.
Arch.Design, from which the studios took up a number of major brno buildings, calculated with space for its company mini-girl since the first drawings of the building of Avriopoint.
It employs almost 90 people mostly at the age of babyboom and is concerned that women designers and architects can return to work quickly.
Together with the possibility of short notices, the school is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees under the social program.
Buildings and architects thus have the opportunity to lock up a demanding job with child care.
The mini-school was designed by Arch employees themselves, and with the support of their leadership, they were able to obtain grants from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The firm's ministration is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (CZK 2,8 million grants), they could purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operations for a period of two years.
After completing the financial contribution (2 years) Arch.Design has a duty to operate a minivan for 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of the project lasted for one year and with the application for a grant, Economy Rating helped significantly.
Péči provides qualified staff, she cares for the children all day long, and the teacher of MSS, so children can go to school without age limits, although most of them are older than 3 years old.
Because it's about a mini-school, there can be only 5 children at the moment, but more children can be separated during the day.
School management is flexible according to the needs of parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the mini-school is comparable to the pre-school framework programme.
Children are not only playing here, but they are also provided with quality education - from basic knowledge to preparation for school courses, English is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their children at any time and drop out of stress with late child rearing from schools away from their parents ’ workplace.
Parents use their working time more productively.
It is no wonder that a loyal relationship between an employee and an employee is created here.
Arch.Design has thus joined Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees are friendly to the family and through this program has enhanced personal marketing.
The house of the bones fascinates after 100 years. Look into the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like the tomb of the ancient jasper, the backyard recalls the five dinosaurs and the balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the local house, thanks to its organic forms, he served the name of the House from the bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, pieces of tiles and mosaics, a facade that resembles hollows and all-like soft curves, all of which is typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The purpose of the house is to play the fabric lines, soft colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
In detail, it is possible to see geometry, rhythm and the exact order of thought.
The whole facade of the house sounds even more dramatic at night, it is lit so that the impression of light colors is even strengthened.
The blame and distortion of forms appear in the same measure in interiors.
The wood in the waves copies the empty frame, the locks, the decorative elements of the door, the hammers and the leaves.
The house of Batlló, located in the Eixample district on the Russian shopping street Passeig de Gràcia no. 43, was created by architect Emilio Sala Cortese in 1877.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon he accepted Gaudí’s idea of unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Casa Batllo's kitchen house, but Antoni Gaudí didn't propose it on his own.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol cooperated with him.
Just on its design floor there were decorations for the representative apartment owner of the property and the use of mosaics on the facade.
She also worked on a number of other artists and artists.
The joint work on the drafts of Casa Batlló's house began successfully with Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the building of Gaudi's house Casa Mila and Park Güell, where there are other Gaudi's works.
From the local house he served after the completion thanks to his organic forms of the nickname "House of Bones".
Others called him "a living house" because of the specific mechanism of opening windows.
It is also said that at the top of the building there is a sword of St. Jir, the patron of Catalan.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other so - called building elements.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system with industrial currents and typical fireplaces for his time.
Bizarni may appear their forty-five degrees.
At Gaudí’s creation, he certainly did not respect the then construction regulations and did not allow them to be bound.
At the beginning of the building, however, the construction permits were obtained from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so important that two years later when the city council was completed, the city council was threatened and asked for repair.
For example, the advice was that the building included pillars and public halls.
No correction ever came, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the call for the city section, Joseph Batlló requested (and successfully obtained) permission to rent two of the highest floors of the building.
The owner moved himself to lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social living room and on the third floor of the bedroom and private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented a shrine.
The whole six-footed house is an open lobby that can stand up to the very roof terrace.
The main elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the saloon doors and the larger company can communicate comfortably together without at the same time maintaining the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new facades, Gaudí's house has also received a non-traditional collapse and two more.
Gaudi's game is also impressive with light, blue and white coloured lawns, which are covered in the inner courtyard, and lights.
The game of two colors adds the maximum light in all patterns of the house.
It was easy to put on the principle that the white reflects the light more than the dark that the sun's paprika, on the other hand, absorbs.
The House of Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most generous apartment available to the public.
The owners decided this step until 2002, at the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
The survey was interrupted because they found it to be a very useful business and, in addition, the survey was expanded into common and basement spaces, including roof terraces.
Access to the memory is certainly not negligible, making 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and tourist guides have a 20% discount.
The sum is significantly higher than the price of entry into other Gaudí's buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the right atmosphere of the house with dragonnecks, you need to quickly complicate one of the people in the kitchen and visit it directly at home.
How to choose mattresses and vegetables: women have requirements other than men
Never the generous frame of bed, but the quality of the bed area, so the mattresses and the growth, give the basis for a really good bed.
However, it must be harmoniously supplemented to suit the specific user.
In choosing, he decides many things, from weight, height, age, health status and sex of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior to which the mattresses and vegetation are arranged.
Typical example?
Maybe on weekends, where she doesn't get drunk regularly, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they're slowly "heating up."
In addition, they have significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
Then it is necessary to turn regularly.
If they don't have a lot of ventilating channels in the core, and they're still on a solid surface, they're holding the moisture: they could also show up the spit.
He also decides on his own choice.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, often using very high mattresses with a softening layer, will find it difficult to feel good on a low and hard surface.
"I hope all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained they wouldn't sleep here."
"On their determined shoulders, legs and sides, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of linen foam."
"These are recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system, so they misconcept the "information" from the hips and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamczykov, who specializes in the refined furniture.
A lot of hockey players, but also other customers, so years ago, a mattress with a line of foam was found.
"Today it's all right, the proper mattress has to be Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL fighter to assess the foam line.
This miracle is simple.
Optimizes your fat and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
You won't get any pressure at night, you won't turn back as if you're having a hard fight.
Just get better sleep.
The line of foam also works as a protection against alloys.
When selecting the size of the mattress to your height, add a length of feet, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm in double, then 180 cm in total.
In single beds, for example in single beds, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For a comfortable and possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back you should have your hands gently tilted in the locator," advises Helena Prokopová, a specialist of the Czech chaplains and decorators, who has been involved in the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of the accommodation for a number of years and is teaching it at specialized schools.
In the double room, you need each of your own growth and mattresses, but here's the shopping attention to sweeten the mattresses.
Otherwise, it's nothing but mounting growth to different heights, but you don't have to manage every frame of bed.
The foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring bone of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters are calculated on the design and cylindrical layer.
"If you touch your hand or touch the mattress, you certainly don't feel the feathers," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grill.
The whole bed, when the mattresses and the floor are like the grown Siamese twins, don't have anything to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are badly blown, they can't be washed out, which is already normal today.
And because at night we usually go between 0.2 and 0.75 l of pot, it's clear that after five to seven years of mattressing, it starts to remember one large (and carved) network.
For this reason, experts reject advertising slogans about the life of the mattresses up to 25 years, or even life assurances.
But everything has its own.
Therefore, the advice from the practice from the sellers: in the mattress with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and work, do not give up the filmable cover, but rather add a mattress protector, which you can easily take and wash.
Although mattresses are usually produced today throughout the circuit, so after dilution, we get two parts (for washing and wash size very important!), however, manipulation in larger types (and in one person) may remind you of the struggle of light weight in the ring with difficulty.
Do you have a hard disk in your bed instead of a barbecue?
Never!
Maximum per bed for one night's visits.
However, measure the board (if it no longer has it) with wind holes and use a mattress with a spring bone and a height of at least 15 cm with spring in bags (with it.Taschenfederkern) and a cypress layer.
Polyurethane mattresses don't belong to such a foundation.
On non-alloy lapel crops, 14 to 18 lapels will be suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (needs a combination of latex and coconut), but you will always be paid for crops with a larger number of lapels, 28 and more, where lapels are in the area of beder double and their home can be regulated.
There are no mattresses with spring bone on the stalking blades because they do not respond to the stalking.
Alongside the setting of the house, you could also like the so-called shoulder colébque.
It's a special capture of the blades that allow you to push or even bend the blade so that the shoulder of the burner will "forget".
For men who have "a shoulder across the back," certainly important thing.
It is even remembered by the matrices producers who in the "panish" began to use the softening zone just in the shoulder area.
Women are also reminded of - they are once again offering soft surface in the hives.
For the most demanding customers there are cold or distilled growths with so-called multi-torque pearing.
The pressure breaks down to more points and reduces tension.
However, as soon as you use the right mattress and grow the wrong pillow (large and "twisted"), most "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow is designed to support the head and the tip only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can be released.
The appropriate size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which they prefer, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should equal the height of the shoulder (with the shoulder strap or with the curved zone in the mattress).
Modern mattresses have nothing to do with original strawberries filled with grass.
Their producers are increasingly using natural materials or at least raw materials.
The trend was just at the mattress.
Raw oils from oil from which polyurethane is produced are replaced by natural oils, such as poppy and soybean.
The soybean is used by all known producers.
"Bio in the mattress means that the core is made from material of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vasiček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattresses, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also enjoy a micro-capsule to relax your fresh scent of wood or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While a man "feels" a plant extract from the bristle to absorb the mattresses and cool the body, the women instead of the subspecies "hot".
The red pepper extract increases the circulation of blood, so it's a weaker sex.
Today's favorites?
The matrix made from cold foam (has larger pores with damaged cell structure, is more flexible than normal polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
The combination of various homes of cold foams and "lying" foams creates multi-zonal mattresses that know exactly where to be head, thighs and pads.
You'll pay for quality mattresses from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those who fulfil health parameters have a lower VAT rate, are taken as health aid.
As the first to reach this advantage of Gumotex in the Czech Republic.
Saving on the mattress and barbecue is not easy.
Sometimes action by producers or sellers who offer two mattresses at one price can be used.
The Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with all memory foam memory in the pot for 11,990 crowns.
The other one can be arranged free of charge.
The Eru line or viscoelastic foam with an open cell structure and high density started with the "cosmic" material Tempur.
Originally created as a material for NASA, because at the beginning the astronauts were exposed to enormous overload.
The temperature in the heat softens, the cold gets stronger.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and divides its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the creation of prolongeds, but also to increase the comfort of sleeping.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as special pillows under the feet that relax the legs and the vital system.
For example, the domestic producers use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and so on.
People's tracking devices want as many parents as possible so they want to protect their children
Fear of your own child leads more and more people to the idea of watching over the GPS.
A system originally created for tracking cars can also monitor the movement of people, thus helping in cases such as the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatkova.
The device is about as big as a box of cheese, but soon it can be big only as hours.
A number of people scared the missing Anička case and began asking for ways to protect their children better.
Even at the cost of breaking their privacy.
"We're trying to tell everyone that it's not about any spying, but about another means to reduce the likelihood that some tragedy will happen," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in a certain case, the abuse of such devices may occur, i.e. when someone who doesn't know about it is admitted to the bag, but we haven't met with such a case yet."
"Most of the customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know for what purpose the box is used and how it is used in case of need.
Children's psychologist Dana Bočkova points out that if a child doesn't want to wear anything like that, he's just getting rid of it.
"And very young children show great creativity in how some things are allowed to be lost if they don't want to be controlled."
"A lot of expectations have been raised earlier with mobile parents who, however, are allowed to turn off the same as these monitoring devices," Bočkova says.
It also argues that in the event of an attack, such a device would really help.
"In the case of a pre-arranged kidnapping, the defendant will practically always ensure that the child has no electronics that could produce his position."
"Now it's the phone."
"When they start expanding their tracking equipment, they will also search for them, because their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In such a case, criminals will always step forward in front of the police," says a psychologist.
However, it will allow similar devices to help in the event of undetected pedophilic attack.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and persons, and in the event of an attack on the immediate destruction of the tracking device, its presence may help.
"The device may be set to the regular dispatch of the position after a certain period of time."
"If his damage occurs, at least the last location of the person concerned will be available."
"The expensive devices have built-in armrests, so even if a person just slipped and remained lying, they send out a warning device immediately with the occurrence of the situation," the Czech said.
According to him, a similar service can also take smart mobile phones with navigation, where it is enough to record special software.
The problem of the current monitoring units is that it is either a device similar to the accessories of the box size from the sires or smaller mobile phones.
They're always so at risk of losing them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, therefore, a device that looks like a normal digital clock is now being tested.
"It will have the greatest advantage in that a possible attacker does not have to know the tracking device at all."
"Or she's known after some time and she can give the police more time," she adds.
Whether tracking devices are developed in straps or trailers, they will continue to use the same technology used to monitor vehicles.
This is a combination of GPS location detection (using normal autonavigation) and mobile phone function, which reports the current position of the vehicle.
The army has a fire-fighting wire to wrap up the Czech Republic. But it only lasts two years.
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of wires that fire the shops.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence added 224 miles [224 km] to the funds.
The army's got 225-year-old supplies.
The problem is, the durability of the rope is two, up to four years.
The Army has bought fire-fighting wires from the action STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
The general staff for reasons of buying such a huge amount of MF DNEs incinerators said that soldiers in training consume 60 kilometres of incinerators annually.
However, it follows from the military pyrotechnics proposals made by MF DNES that all generals, officers of the army, secretaries or cleaners would have to undergo a very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Minister of Defence Alexandra Vondr and Army Commander Vlastimil Picka is not exempt.
That's the only way to justify the annual military consumption of 60 kilometers of firearms.
This length corresponds to 25 thousand explosions.
And even if it really did, the army's resources would last for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, it would be necessary for each new professional to have a minimum of two metres of incinerators, as experts say, the army has ensured by a fresh purchase - even with increased consumption of female or special units - supplies for the above 225 years.
Soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade, while Minister Vondrova had recently personally complained that they did not have nearly any weapons at hand, so the shootings were also limited due to the need for money.
He won't talk about lack of underwear.
"It doesn't take my head to buy from us so much fires again."
"But it's their decision and they know for sure what they're going to do."
"For us, the army is a good customer, whom we as traders are trying to pronounce," says the business manager STV Group Jan Děcký.
The defence ministry spokesperson Jan Pejšek argues that hundreds of miles of rope purchased and that the army will have the resources of this "municipal" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký from the STV Group, however, speaks only of the four-year life of a firefight and police or military pyrotechnics for only two years.
"With the perfect storage, it can be the four," says one of them, who as a soldier does not want to publish the name because of the criticism of the army.
After life has passed, each ammunition must carefully test whether it is still reliable and does not endanger soldiers for life.
These tests, however, are not free and are worth more money.
Another argument by the Ministry is a multi-stakeoff of 445 kilometers of fire-fighting wires.
"We stood by 60 per cent less than the last delivery of two hundred and forty kilometers," explains Pejšek spokesman for the opinion of the Ministry of Defence.
Only for comparison: the annual consumption of firefighting nets of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate ammunition from World War II or here after the Soviet army, does not exceed a few years of 1,500 meters.
And the police are always ordering only a lot to consume this munitions even before life's down.
It has been certified for the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can also obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence already faces significant difficulties with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two-setsets Czechoslovak army prepared to move to Rýn.
According to the pyrotechnics that MF DNES spoke about, there is a problem in a few years: it will eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old fires that "lasino" buys today.
So far, I've been pumping out of the contacts that I've got through the competition.
The winner of the competition The Year's Lifeline helped Lukas Pytloun sell French his hotel.
The winner of the last year's competition The Year's Lifeline became the eighteen-year-old entrepreneur Lukas Pytloun from Liberce.
His story of success is like a movie.
Lucas Pytlon loved traveling.
And he realized abroad that there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price in Liberia.
Out of backup from foreign brigades and using a bank loan, he bought a five-bedded house.
Because he was still a third-year-old high school student at the time, that was a great encouragement.
"The closer relationship between quality and the price of accommodation with us did not allow me to try to do something about it," said Lukas Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment started renting foreign workers.
All profit invested back into the house, which gradually turned into a 54-bed pension.
Since then, he has been able to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with total capacity over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation in Liberia.
The most comfortable of them was the recently four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, another, equally high quality came to him.
"We just have a signed agreement with a hotel in Ostrova near Tís, where we sold our French concept and other interested people about the French hotels Pytloun reported," says last year's lucky number one.
"And for this sale the license to operate the hotel was very much divided by the victory of the Year's animal race," Pytloun admits.
Victory has brought him greater knowledge and popularity in Liberia and the surrounding area.
"People knew me on the streets, often even gratified me further, and I have to say that it was nice," he recalls.
Participation in the competition is certainly recommended to all who are trying to do something.
It's not even necessary to win. Every sight is good.
He says he's been choking from contacts and acquaintances to which he might not have been reached otherwise.
"With some I met because of the competition, I started trading regularly."
The glory associated with success, according to him, has reached a little of every employee.
And he's got about seventy of them.
"I observe with them greater loyalty and pride that they share in something that has gained universal recognition."
"It's not far from my personal success, it's the result of good work for all of us."
"Only my name is cast forward," says the modest Lukas Pytloun today.
I wish my successor a year calmer than we had at Farmet.
The Euphoria of victory quickly triggered the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner, however, Farm has worse times than he has.
For the first prize in the last year of the Vodafone Company competition, the owner of Farmet, Karel Ždárský, came to Slovenia last February.
At that time, the jury assessed the efforts it had made to build from a small tool shop in the Czech Skalica firm with stamilion facilities.
"I can say that the appreciation has not only stimulated me, but all my colleagues have increased our self-awareness for the competition struggle," said last year's winner.
At the beginning of Farm's history, it was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered the father of Karl Žjárské to hire a small worker as a compensation for communists' entertainment property, he for a long time refused his career in the company where he was working, and with a few friends around his dad put the company on plastic baths.
Soon thereafter, they began specializing in the leaves of the plant oil.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturers of automatic forests in Central Europe.
More awareness was also gained by the company after successful competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start taking the Farm brand significantly better, but foreign partners also began to appreciate that they were working with the company that achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Jjárský.
Last year, however, he wasn't only in Farmet in the symbol of the euphoria of victory.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic performance by 2008 and only partially since 2009.
And it was the year 2009 that was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
A crisis that has not yet affected citizens, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and have started to limit the purchase of new machinery and technology.
"Of course this situation didn't escape us."
"The markets dropped by 40 percent, we had to limit production and there was also a release," explains Karel Jjárský.
A life-saving company must sometimes take such unpopular measures.
But things got better and the company kept it going, even if I was less than before the crisis.
But what they didn't do in Farmet is investment in research and development.
"We built research and training centres from the grants, we reinforced the presentation at international fairs, we won major awards at home exhibitions," says Jjérský.
It all proves that the crisis is behind them.
The markets are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Jjárský.
A questionnaire that removes unreasonable rules
The Absurdita survey of the year is the fourth part of the business plan.
Some unwise rules have already succeeded in eliminating them.
An unfavorable winner of the next year's Absurdita year survey has become an obligation to bring to the office documents which are also available to officials online.
It has decided more than a third of the four thousand votes cast.
For example, management of social security required a paper receipt from the trade register, even though the official can obtain it by two clicks of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, it's going to change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require a statement from the trade register in checks on the insurer's payers," ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buranová said.
To focus on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and the foolish to abolish is the meaning of the Absurdit year competition.
This year it is the fourth part of the corporate curse organized by the Economic Journals and among the public it is looking forward to an ever-increasing form.
If the polls were attended by about three thousand voters, four thousand were silent this year.
And there's no wonder, the various legal responsibilities that only serve to keep the business, we still have enough.
"We may be in the number of lais for tax recognition in the front seats of the world," notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Vulnerants of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business has been declared the goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions of business, the Czech Republic has placed itself at 74th position, which is about eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdita year competition was first announced in 2006 and runs annually according to the same scenario.
The administrative and bureaucratic nonsense may be reported by anyone each year from April to the end of September when the competition is closed.
The website of www.firmaroku.cz Then the competition editor selects seven candidates for "anti-cein" and lets the public vote on the website of www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz during October.
An absurdity that gets the most votes winning.
More than a hundred, more than 105 regulations and anti-subsidy regulations were reported in the survey this year.
The guys sent businessmen, but also professional ties and journalists.
Among the "finalists" competition is such a requirement, for example, that vehicles for road maintenance and fast-track maintenance pay a bribe, or that entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of seven proposals this year is published on the competition pages.
The declaration of competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November at the Václav Square in Prague, is part of the arrest, which regularly participates in political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, assisted this competition.
"The economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws business clucks under its feet, so it is my goal to cancel every year at least three dozen paragraphs that are just too complicated today," said the Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Trying to break a foolish regulation does not express itself in vain.
In 2007, most people managed to report the obligation of an entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the nursing office at the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the exhibition station or the tower.
This obligation was removed by a new life law.
The second most voted duty in 2007, which was declared to the employment office for its foreign staff, for up to 30 days, was removed by the Green Card Act.
And to a third of everything good.
An absurd regulation for physiotherapists in 2009 has become a large mirror, refrigerator and two inflatable weights in the office.
This year, the Ministry of Health has reduced the obligation to have a refrigerator.
The new category assesses the social responsibility companies
Assessment of ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
This year’s fifth annual competition for Economic News is a category called the Responsible Company 2010.
I am sending this competition to support a reasonable and fair business.
"This is how we want to support companies that take into account the impacts of their business on the environment and support socially responsible activities," says Patrick Bartholda, regional mobile operator manager, Vodafone, who is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as in the case of a year's rebel competition.
To this year's first year, this special subcategory of the Vodafone Company's main competition in 2010 was registered by companies for which there is no success in its sole long-term objective.
The story of each of them is very inspiring, and he would write a separate article.
Although one of the two activities is different from the other in diameter, their efforts can be regarded as support and consideration for common denominators.
In one case, for example, people with disabilities and other needs of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen full-republic finalists, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the company in charge of the Pardubic region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the Children's Fund for seventeen years.
The old paper from Podébrad, which has more than 70 per cent of its health-related employees, is still old about its health-related employees, and has therefore been given the title of the Responsible Company of the Central Country, and in the Vodafone Company competition this year has been placed in the third country.
At Olomouck she won the MiRyz Soft accounting company, which introduced a flexible working time, which was also reduced to an average of 35 hours a week, but without a moderately reduced salary.
Its title was also awarded by the jury for primarily purchasing from Czech producers, supporting civil activities in the near environment and the whole environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our businesses and our administrations have the least impact on the environment," explains the manager Milosze Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from Ústecký kraje re-thinks the health of its employees and has arranged ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each of their notebooks, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by locally protected workers in their business activities.
"In addition, we support the hope of a man in the pressure that helps specifically the local Roma community," says a representative of Ondřej Suhý.
In the last row, there is also a reference to the activity of the Clean and Cleanup company in the Karlovar region, which contributes to their pension insurance to their employees in the form of over-standard bonuses.
"We also make contributions to food, transport, qualification and recreation," says Josef Strapác of the Bruntal Construction Company Czasch, winner in Moravskoslej region.
The responsible company of the year was automatically registered by all the national finalists of the Vodafone Company of the year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the author by 15 August at the latest.
The incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the author.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, the competitions could not participate The company responsible for the year, but were not disqualified from the "main" competition of the Vodafone Company for the year."
"It is not only possible to register in this competition, because it is a subcategory of the company's main competition year," explains Karel Goldman from Bison & Rose's editorial agency.
At the Land Fund in Plzni police arrested in public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plsna, anti-corruption police were arrested in the past days.
The railway detectives planted a local business in the media and a businessman with the realities of Luboši G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the current public competition in order to obtain the land offered in the competition by a particular interested party.
That's what Luboshi G. was supposed to pay half a million crowns for.
"I would just like to confirm that the police are bringing one person to the scene in public procurement and in public competition," said Plenary State Representative Law Director Antonie Zelená, saying that further details regarding the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
Forty-four-year-old policemen were released after 24 hours.
The way in which public competition could have been affected can only be speculative in view of the minimum official information.
The spokesperson of the Land Fund of Lubomír Black on the question of the Law stated that at a separate workplace in Plsna the police had actually been arrested, which was during the public competition.
"It was about a client, not our employee," she explained.
The public competition has a correct name according to the Black name "The challenge to bid claims to transfer land under the Land Act" and is made where more eligible applicants are interested in the land offered.
"These persons in the context of the challenge offer a higher value of their refund claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"On the basis of the claims offered, the order of the buyers will be determined and the Land Fund will then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the speaker explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information about the applicant and because he is also a entitled person, because he has collected a number of refund claims, he offered to the interested parties the ground that the competition is not involved.
Well, he's been incassing the distance for that.
That would explain that he had so much money to keep.
Luboš G. has had over-standard PF contacts in the past.
He was a figure in the case of former Chief PF Václav Sankot, who was criminally charged with issuing in a replacement refund of the land on which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
At that time, Luboš G. obtained from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the entry magistrates were to be built into the industrial zone of the Borská field.
Later, he changed them with the magistrate behind the house in the very historical center of the city, which had much higher value.
At that time, the council had to come to this because otherwise the building would be compromised by blocking the land.
Households for housing pay a hundred per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and livestock, heat supplies and somewhere to grow and rent.
The families will have to pull from the ice from the wallet to hundreds of crowns a month more than now.
Electricity saves up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, while in some cities you will have to pay for water supplies and many will also observe central heat supplies.
The electricity supply should be provided to households in the apartments annually by the stock of the railway than it is now.
The prices of the power plants were reduced by all major suppliers, so there is a significant increase in energy support from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaic.
It's a bit of a gas, though, at a time when people get the most melt and have the highest consumption.
So it also has to be calculated annually with hundreds of crowns.
While electricity and gas are growing throughout the Republic, changes in central heating prices vary from place to place.
Price increases are mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, a house in Pardubice or Hradci Krālová will pay from January for the central heating of about 50 crowns a month, more than 1000 crowns a year will pay the family in Liberia.
The people of Prague are again threatened with more than 9 per cent being kept watery and muddy, in case the city increases the rent from the infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't change, the Praguen will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be in the whole Republic comparison between the lower.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are now among the highest, it has a watery and sparse search of 7.4 percent.
For example, they may increase the rent price in 450 thousand rental apartments, where the regulation ends from January.
For example, CPI Housing, which in Ústí nad Laba owns about 2500 apartments, intends to increase the rent from January to a hundred percent.
Those who do not agree with a new higher lease will be willing to give a company to the court.
The regulated rents that people pay in about 300 thousand flats could increase by 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptional and better brand of whiskey stolen by parents.
These are drinks, after which the most frequent drink is done in the care of doctors, who haven't even been 15 years.
An exception are not children who are treated with monkeys in the hospital repeatedly.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases at the income of the child wards of hospitals.
"Natural beer or wine are completely worthless, because it takes a long time to drink them."
"The trend is certainly hard alcohol," said the Prime Minister of the Children's Department Nemocnice Horovice in the Central Czech Republic, Luděk Pelikán.
"If they manage to pull a spoon out of the closet, it's about whiskey, but it's about fernet and vodka."
"The water has the advantage of getting into the juice and is not that much of it then," the Prime Minister explained.
And the truth is, he's also giving him the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurin.
"It's mostly fernet or rum."
"It's modern alcohol today, especially at primary schools."
"In some cases it was about the sink they brought from home," Jurin said.
According to the primary Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen drinks on hospital admission are relatively common.
He worked for ten years in a pediatrician in Motola, where the nurses are holding out to trained students from a wide area.
"A girl was lying with us about four times."
"The career began in the 12 years when it was brought to us with 3.5 miles of alcohol in the blood, in addition to ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition in Hollywood at some dance party."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't come at all strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the primary said.
I am not interested in parents or even their considerable tolerance to drinking their own offspring is considered the main cause of growing child alcoholism.
However, according to experts, it is not possible to talk about the dependence of the right word on children.
"Several chronic alcohol addictions are understood by alcoholics with all the phenomena that belong to them, and it's not for children."
"In those who use alcohol over and over again, there is a more significant unspoken family-social background," explained Prime Minister Pelikán.
According to lecturer Jurin this year at a pediatric clinic in Motole, about 40 children were hospitalized in mid-November.
However, only those with heavy poisoning that had to stay in the hospital will get to the statistics.
Children drinkers who will take their parents to the hospital after they are hospitalized, if they can get the police at home, don't count at all.
In addition to the cases where children just sit around school and drink a spoon, there are, according to Pelicán, three seasonal exercises on which you can rely: witches, Silvester and the end of school year.
"It's either a pity for the wrong confession, or it's a celebration of the beginning of the holidays."
"Even so, at the witch shop, I lived at the reception and seven children's drinks all at once," Pelikán said.
The drink that spends the night detoxifying under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically beneficial to the one who suffers from an unpleasant cocoon the second day at home.
Early headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are due to the ingestion of glucose and vitamins that are missing from the body.
"They're actually better at it because they have a beautiful evening experience and a good awakening and nothing's wrong."
"They're only confused about where they are," Pelikán admitted, sometimes destroying patients with a pleasant mood at least the cost that their treatment required.
Transport of healing and hospitalization on the emergency bed will also come to tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I applied it as an educational device when I then calculated to these children on a visit how much they had become drunk and that they could also spend the whole summer on the brigade to make a party," Pelikán added.
However, according to him, the health insurance system is subject to regressive treatment, in which parents would charge treatment costs for children’s drinkers.
Two L-159 airports are the first to be held by foreigners in Spain
Two L-159 flights from the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged the Casa C-295M transport aircraft on Tuesday, they flew to the Spanish Seville, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It's the first thing the machines of this type found in possession of someone other than the Czech army.
In abroad, they have only been on exercises or performances for years.
It is a dual version of L-159T1, which has been operated by the Czech army and which have been able to fly.
The remaining three machines are the same L-159.
They are still served in the Aeru Vodochody and the trader of the trade - Omnipol - took over them last week.
According to Jan Pejška, when the aircraft is physically transported from Vodochod, it is not known yet.
"One-stop L-159 airports for the exchange have been excluded from the long term of the airports, without any other deposits and investments from the Ministry's resort."
"Two L-159T1 were changed in the current state and form," the Law of Pejšek said.
He added that the army would not be left without two-stop planes, because in May 2009 the Ministry signed a 200 million crowns contract with Aero Vodochody to rebuild four non-necessary L-159 machines into two two-stop machines.
One new plane took over the army in July, the other will be taken to the end of this year.
According to Pejška, EADS has pledged that the aircraft will go into the arms of some of the allies.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the recipient of L-159 flights and will serve to train NATO pilots."
"It is therefore the things the receiver will do," Pejšek said.
The economic newspaper reported that, for example, the Spanish army of L-159 is not interested in the news.
The exchange of five L-159 for one airport Casa and the purchase of three more flights for 3.5 billion crowns approved by Mirka Topolánka last year.
The Ministry of Defence did not sign up for the selection procedure and spoke directly to EADS.
The then defence leadership argued that the exchange would support future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and used only 24, the rest of them would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa's aircraft will probably have a trial run.
The European Commission, the Czech Ministry of Defence, complained to the European Court of Justice about the choice of aircraft based on a whole European trend rather than a single producer.
The army has already taken over three of Casa's flights, the last one should fly to Kbely's Prague airport within fourteen days.
Longer indicator than ring means lower risk of cancer
Men who have a marker longer than a ring are exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion to the study published by the British cancer magazine on Wednesday.
It can be related to male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60 years of age," said a co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor of cancer research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help to determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially in combination with genetic risk or other dangerous factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time more than three thousand healthy men were observed with colleagues in Britain.
More than half of the participants in the study had a right-hand indicator shorter than a ring.
She paid for them the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long.
In the case of those who had a pointer longer than a ring, however, this risk decreased by 33 per cent, which for men up to 60 made a reduction of up to 87 per cent.
The length of the two fingers - made in prenatal period - is likely to reflect the different levels of sex hormones that the child is exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a further indicator.
Previous studies have shown that testosterone is just supporting the growing cancer of the prostate.
The former Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Pačes told CZK that he usually knows about this study, but he does not seem to believe that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer would be "fully proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
On roads and trails lies mostly burnt snow, drivers in many places drove all night.
The D5 motorway between 89 and 93 km in the morning is closed in the direction of the Raspberry because of several accidents in both freight and passenger cars, and D1 is also standing at Brno in the direction of Prague.
The driver of the Central Car Club (UAMK) told the news.
There was a truck crashing at 90 miles [91 km], two trucks hit, an accident caused an injury.
Several personal cars also ended up in the basement.
Problems are also on the D1 road to 185 km towards Prague.
There were two trucks.
Drivers should ride close to Brno at 190 km or cross Brno and then drive at 182 km on Kívalce.
There are several kilometers of columns.
There's an accident on the D11 road, too, and it's on the way to Prague.
In Prague lies several centimeters of snow, temperatures show minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, the cars are built on Prosek, which is also störboholska.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Tramvaje is driving late, for example, on the road between Karl's Square and Peace Square.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis camp is to be rescinded.
There are also problems with railways and airports.
The Czech routes had already had to cancel seven fast connections because of the snow.
Problems have, for example, a trail from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroon.
Passengers should control the current situation.
Ruzyna Airport was closed from 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most of the roads to South Moravia are already mobile, but only with increased caution.
In Viškovsk there are three roadside roads, in Brnońsk there are snowflakes, and in Blanensk there are some communications in the snowflakes.
The most affected places were Viškovsko.
So far, there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Mileshovice.
They're gonna have to put the phrases in their way.
When they're driven, they can't be estimated yet.
In Hodoninsk there is a need for caution in the White Carpathians area.
On roads that are only maintained by the inert phase due to nature protection, the CTC stated that it is up to a 50 centimeter level of snow.
In the Czech Republic, between two and three inches [10 cm] of snow fell, the most in the northern Czech Republic, many to 18 cm [18 cm].
In Moravskoslej region, about 15 cm [15 cm] of snow was attacked.
Snowing in the Czech Republic is rising.
American soldiers have a new "wise weapon"
The U.S. Army has planted a new "wise" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under code XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect that conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a little super-precious work.
Its designs indicate a laser with accuracy of several meters.
Special rounds of 25 mm, designed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive market, actually work as small grenades.
The races can be programmed so that they explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trails.
It can therefore be used against an enemy hiding behind a barrier, a wall, or a pit.
Because Shora is usually not protected, and if a deadly rain of steel strikes it, it can be eliminated from the battle.
According to Richard Audetta, who participated in the development of XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon to be used by the "smart" technology.
"The soldier in principle treats her by finding a target, sending a laser beam to him, which determines the distance, so that he will get a clear point of intent, according to him, adjusts the measure and pushes the ball."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"If you press the gun, the gun will go down and fire the gun at the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
Moves 400 jobs
The Fujits Group is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees move their jobs in July next year from today's administrative building to Marienbader-námest in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese group of Fujits moves its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As he said on Wednesday, a giant in the field specializing in computers and their maintenance, moved 400 men and women from their workplace from today's administrative building to Marienbader-nammett in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, in Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the statement by Fujista, there should still be another 100 jobs in the group, which are currently distributed in the region at the appropriate time.
The offer of rent was that the astro park’s very attractive and large-scale offices are more suited to the working methods of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just renting.
"In Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central site with excellent infrastructure."
Excellent connection to the airport is just as important to global society as Fujitsu.
The recent movement of an important business within the region brought joy yesterday in the winners and disappointments in the defeated.
The leading economic rapporteur in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said this succeeded in obtaining a "global player".
It's a fantastic expression of trust in this locality.
Fujitsu is probably fit for the city, housing is an important boost for Niederrad.
Mayor Bad Homburg, Michael Korwis (Greens), regretted Fuji's decision.
The city was informed in good time by the company's management of its intention.
"Of course, we offered our help to companies," said Korwis.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the difficulty of the computer manufacturer with the tenant of the real estate at Marienbader-nämt.
As a result, there were decisive economic reasons.
It is now about preventing a long stay in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
The house in Rathaus-majority, which has been using Fujitsu so far, and the neighboring "Kleine Verticale" belonged ten years ago with the other buildings in Marienbader-majority to the most discussed construction intentions of the town of spa.
Between the station and the town council, a joint project of the city and a private projector called the city entrance, however, was criticised for the massive construction of areas that had previously served as a parking lot and at the same time for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, a company of investment advice and rating Ferri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as a computer manufacturer of Fujitsu, who was once again connected to Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired in 2006 by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and after years were sold by the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu Group from Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it offers computers and servers available and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch in the area of Rýna and Mohan is one of the largest in Germany, but the largest employees in Fujitsu are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, he moved to Frankfurt-Niederrad, a subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions, another subsidiary of Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
In the administrative building, Astro Park was located for this purpose 7000 square meters.
In the complex - its name points to the star landscape, which is twenty years old, also sits in addition to other central links of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon server shutdown - warnings against Assangem
Wikileaks is getting into trouble.
The Amazon Internet service turned off the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this has happened to political pressure following the publication of the statistics of secret diplomatic deps.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is allegedly held in the United Kingdom.
Wikileaks, a platform for detection, is getting under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their modern home server in America and are now searching for a home online in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is on the list sought by Interpol, is to be held according to a newspaper contribution in the United Kingdom.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free speech in a country of freedom", activists announced a short news service on Wednesday (local time).
The Amazon Internet company recently downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used the publication of the Amazon Web Service (AWS) secret diplomatic deps to manage a high number of access to documents.
Twitter services have explained Wikileaks to this step: "Good - our dollars are now lost by hiring people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's co-workers conducted the investigation, published the CNN TV station on the basis of information from Lieberman's office.
The president of the Senate Home Defense Committee threatened Amazon with a boycott, informed the British "Guardian".
"I would like Amazon to join this step earlier, given the earlier publication of information classified on Wikileaks," said the senator.
In the meantime Lieberman called for the prevention of the platform in the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks is one of the most illegal, indiscriminate and independent, and thus our national security is exposed to danger and threatens our lives on the planet," said a statement by the non-Side Senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand stolen material."
Founder Wikileaks Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is on the list sought by Interpol.
Based on a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", a 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigation in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Speaker Wikileaks Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were threats.
"Even challenges were to kill Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is afraid of his security, Hrafnsson said.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson must have responded to the findings of North America.
In America the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested that the person responsible for publishing on Wikileaks be charged and corrected for treason.
In Canada, one of the leaders of the government of Stephen Harper said on TV - ironically, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use "target plane".
In the meantime, the White House and Assange were divided.
US President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "Laughter and absurd", that Assange asked the foreign minister to resign Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for the recently published Spanish diplomats' challenges.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of a man with websites," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and interests of this country are much more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now examining the security of its databases.
The Special Representative was appointed as the representative of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Action, Russell Travers, informed the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of "necessary reforms in the structure", which are necessary after publishing messages from the mission to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review ways in which the entire government is exchanging and protecting information.
The U.S. government also announced that it wanted to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they were to be put in danger of publishing on Wikileaks.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," foreign ministry spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We're prepared to protect them, but it would be necessary."
Frozen University
At "Gelato University" in Bologna, frozen sugars are being prepared for a better annual period.
The basic course for the future freezer, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where's the ice cream actually being taken?
From Gelatier and Gelatio.
Gelatier, Czech a little old ice cream maker, manufactures cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio puts out ice cream from the fridge box, puts it in the counter and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about the ice cream, he won't get away with "Gelato-University" by the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the ice cream machine manufacturer set up an ice-cream university to match the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is huge interest and visitors come from all over the world.
However, a number of special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice are also offered in their own refrigerator.
Some people want their Midlife-Criss after a new career, others dare to take on the thin ice of their vague claims.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all parts of the world - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the Ice-Cream industrial country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a refrigerator in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one in Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman in Julia's home came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gletiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to participants the ideal properties of perfect ice cream.
The decision-maker is not only a good taste, but also a good sense and a good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training at the South and the Dormitory at the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then it's still one of the most important doses of romance."
The first step in production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano inserts the basic ingredients of milk, skimmed milk, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixer, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then it rotates on the machine with the chicken and runs out of pasteurised white basic cream, the basis of all kinds of milk freezes.
Immediately, the teacher is asleep with questions: Is it possible to produce ice cream only from natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can a person experiment on his own?
Luciano's warning to take the spirit away from the unknown.
Who's talking about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", apparently the same used stabilizers - most of the natural product, such as guar molasses from guar bean.
Of course, it is possible to produce ice cream without stabilisers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will fall and the customer itself will have ice cream.
Certain variations of the basic mass are allowed.
It'll be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes with the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sugar department.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"The suppliers will try to use a lot of aromatized ingredients."
"You should just experiment."
Be fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or they will freeze from the white basic mass, which will change the eggs into yellow cream and cocoa on the basis of a variety of chocolates.
Now he's taking the ice-cream class.
Luciano is always made of four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and liquefied ice cream - either with eggs or without them in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavours or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will also be carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit pears - because taste is not always better.
Liscoorice ice must not taste more oscillating when it contains more liscoorice.
The most popular ice cream from the kiwi produces a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
Only when the balanced mixture lifts the right taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: If broccoli is used with a lot of sugar, the share of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
There's a need for extra sugar in lemon ice cream.
Luciano is issuing a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (wine is measured from grapes).
Luckily, the tables make numbers easier.
The production of ice cream does not require as much body weight as before.
It does not only assist in the automatic production of basic material.
There is also a device that simultaneously blends the ready-to-frozen mixture into the cream and cools to the lower temperature.
Despite all the automation, we don't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo will poison himself and his colleagues to the bottom of the fruit pear when he gets out of control of a huge mixer.
"In every course," she thinks Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time when something like this happens."
Auditors in double light
The European Food Authority of EFSA is bound by an industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This charge has now been expressed by a group of experts from Testbiotech, which is considered to be an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a spy theory, but we have documented it well," said Christoph Then, Head of Testbiotech on Wednesday.
The leaders of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and other EFSA experts have been in a relationship with the Ilsa lobbyists for several years.
This is funded by a group like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has played a decisive role in the control of the EFSA for genetic plants and is thus in a clear focus of interest, criticizing Then.
The provisions of the EFSA shall be in full line with the documents of the Ilsi and shall be such that the industrial manuscript should be inspected by the Italian Parliament.
It's a second time that Testbiotech points to the target of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from the Efs passed away without any extras or transitional time to the Swiss Agrarian Syngenta Group - and this changed the parties.
The announcement for Central Germany (MDR) also revealed a recent personal link between the EU Industrial Lobby Control Agency, which aroused both the Ministry of Environment and EU Members.
In the meantime, Efs can't recognize the interest.
It works with all the serious data, i.e. those from industry, if they are highly highly qualified, is indicated in one declaration.
Experts who work for Efs are not required to have contacts with industry.
But he has to prove it.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It itself is referred to as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - except for the assessment of the risks of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticise that at present genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any feeding attempt, and that genetic plants do not respond to the environmental impact.
"We want to know what, for example, will make genetically modified corn on the field," says Then.
The current practice is to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If they're not looking for risks, how could they be found?" she asks Then.
With the consent of Angelika Hilbeck.
The scientific workshop has been examining genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical High School in Zurich.
In this area, industry as well as in the United States is now trying to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe.
That's why there's almost no scientists who wouldn't be connected to the group anymore.
Most studies are not published that are critical for companies.
"Industry controls security research," Hilbeck thinks.
Stone level
Uli Gsell also ordered some, about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he stood in front of the station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It's snowing.
The story is known: In September the coppers arrived and began to shake a large part of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands demonstrated against the S21, the billion-dollar reduction of the station.
When the building was stopped, most of the wings were in trouble.
Breaked into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
A soldier from Craisheim, a soft, rough stone used in the years 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is an associate in Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
He secured several of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He can't disappear."
It goes out, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and original."
When one was cut, he smelled like a cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with those pieces.
The rocks have time.
Ollie Gsell, too.
The stock of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest at Tübingen on the ex-municipality of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought all the things that came up during the raid in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were to wake up on a lock or disappear on a deposit," he says in his office, a wooden building that was a former watchhouse.
They tell him that he was given and threatened, when in September all the newspapers said he bought the remains of the northern wing from a company that is carrying out a democracy.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents all day.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything for democracy.
And when that happens, it's the smartest thing to do when the stones continue to be used.
Then it took about 200 S-21 opponents each about 80 kilograms of hard block, price per piece 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some are also hoping that he will return to the reconstruction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, cost 25 large trucks.
About half of it's still in the woods, the rest of it's been sold long ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all corners and pulled what went into the trunk and the trailer.
The stones of the dispute from Stuttgart have long been transformed into "walls" or as edges of fences with plants.
"This stone is really nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political fabric."
He sits in his field car and goes for a ride after his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied the law in advance, he interrupted the study, later biology, then interested in computers and eventually became a stone merchant.
And a stone lover.
It has 40,000 tons of stones stored.
He respects his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest dealer with old stones in the Republic.
It's fast.
In the snow, there's an artificially developed writer.
"One of them belonged to the Marian Bridge in the Krajdjanes," he says.
A writer from Laba, yellow, warm, excited.
"My favorite stone."
We're going up the road through the woods.
Shows on the collection: red writer, earlier part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And so on.
"Beautiful Travertine."
On one occasion, those flowers belonged to the Neckarstadion Tribune in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police office in Stuttgart, a red granite from the temple of Sankt Blasien, a tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What a job, what a struggle, what a trip.
When Rongen is thinking about how the stones were torn apart by hand and transported by simple stickers and bull carriages, he becomes quite polite.
"It'd be a shame if something like that was shaking."
He didn't get rich, he didn't get rich anymore.
A stone merchant today employs 14 people and, in addition, in the woods, the stoners, one baker, one cook, one glass and one gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who assesses the remains.
In due time, he has to go to Colín.
The stones will be saved there, too.
Fighting talent about High-potentials
There's a lot of people at the funeral.
16 students are pressed with salmon bread, tomatoes and sweetness.
Technical University in Braunschweig and car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students to machinery and design at the workshop.
Together with the VW developers here they are going to talk about the car of the future - and only to know Volkswagen by the way.
A lot of companies are trying to compete for the smartest heads, as well as VW companies, to succeed and work together with universities.
Their mission is to recruit, as soon as possible, the most likely graduates in their audiences, before they get to the labour market and become interested in them.
Since universities don't issue any lists of students' success, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in practical-oriented projects and get them.
At TU Braunschweig, the car company is trying to get talent the second day.
One young lady from the private department distributes scissors, rubber bears and boards with the VW logo.
He tells the hopeful young talents about programs for practice, student jobs and points them in the way to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see the benefits for both sides: "Students will get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"The VW can meet students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates, and think about who would be known as a collaborator."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the news is, he's so openly fighting about students.
"It was rather a major professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many sectors companies can no longer choose their employees from long-term representatives.
On the contrary, they must try and try to impose particularly highly qualified workforce.
In particular, graduates of engineering sectors have an excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the German engineering team, the VDI remained in October unencumbered 40,000 engineering positions.
And according to VDI, the so-called lack of engineers is still growing.
After the audit and consulting firm KPMG, Roman Dykta is going to hunt for talent.
Organizes demanding Recruiting events, such as KPMG-Race, a type of modern treasure race in which participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promised students to the United States next year.
At the same time, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
It will be decided in two selection wheels, who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many interested people fly to the United States.
In the fight for High Potentials at universities they will be paid under the Dikty increasingly tougher laws.
"We want to distinguish ourselves with our race from the others."
"The simple trip to the shipyard was too little for us."
Looks like a Dikta talent hunter's lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all the participants like last year."
"Some people will soon finish their studies and plan to get back to work with us," he says.
In addition to direct talk on campus, small and medium-sized companies are presented classicly on the labour markets.
"We're trying to contact the graduates at the professional show."
"As in Intersolar," says Sith Stübe, head of the personal department of solar technology producer Solarworld.
The company from Bonn employs some 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
Currently there are 35 posts on the company's website.
"At the present time, it's just hard to sit free."
"It's a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is contact with university professors.
Solarworld is working with various high schools, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that we can do practice or write a diploma."
The solar specialist does not arrange any expensive advertising.
Instead, the company is trying to attract other benefits: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"Many groups often cannot offer it," says the head of the Personal Department of Stübe.
Looking for a job doesn't play a major role anymore.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good procedural opportunities are other crucial factors.
Solarworld had 55th place among the top 100 employees in Germany in one study at the Institute's Great Place.
The Institute shall draw up an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, employees are asked how they are satisfied with their work and working environment and are monitoring the conditions of employees.
The head of the Personal Department of Stübe hopes that her placement will bring points to the employees.
"I think that stakeholders are particularly informed about the external evaluations of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to see yourself as an attractive employer leads through his own employees," he says.
This is called the Internal Employer Branding, which is the introduction of an employee on the market within the framework of its own employees.
"The satisfaction of the employees is the best of dispatches."
When the company takes good care of its people and they identify themselves with the company, they will make themselves advertising to their employer between friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a tie game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil gardens
During the following years, a new oil garden will not emerge on the coast of Florida, U.S.A., in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - and thereby abolished the previous plan with its final validity.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new gardens are under ban.
Minister Ken Salazar told you on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should pay at least the following five years, is an explosion on the garden tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Prior to this accident, which led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled opposition and industry's will to allow new gardens in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The hostages are trying to reduce US dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
To this day, it is not clearly explained who is responsible for destroying the oil in the Gulf.
The UK energy group BP is in the middle of criticism, which is confronted with billions of requests.
The investigation committee entrusted to Obama should present the results during December.
In October, the Minister of Interior Ken Salazar cancelled the ban on the return which he paid from the explosion.
Subsequently, different oil groups submitted applications for new garden purposes.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters by stricter controls and strict security regulations.
At present, the control authority is being reformed in principle, which has warned itself of many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would abolish the lucrative option of tax evasion for oil and gas groups.
The industry is now openly warning that more stringent regulation will substantially reduce the volume of oil in the Gulf.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the gas and oil industry", the result of the current research in the area of the BDO consulting company - even before the ban on turning into Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance still complains about uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what the regulation is going to change."
Investments in new business projects are being postponed until they are withdrawn - on the basis of growth.
The Ogoni area is burning
The water in the rivers is oily, it smells like a pump: billions of litres of unique oils have destroyed the nature of Ogoni in Nigeria.
People live by stealing, corrupting, and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari thinks so well.
"Don't worry," the reporters calmed down the environmental activist: "Today you'll get a lot more oil mill in front of the target."
37-year-old Nigerian was trying to take a picture of a boy floating on his chest with water wrapped around his ears: the scene works in the waterlight with spiritual colors almost to the beauty.
It's not visible that under the surface of the blue humid hump of oil.
She used to collect enough shrimp in here, reports Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetti River.
In the meantime, the effluent water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large quantity of oil fell into a huge wave of oil.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must dive for at least six hours to get into the waters where the fish are: the area of Ogoni, which is located in the heart of the Niger delta, belongs to one of the world's worst frozen areas.
The road along the river with the mangrove bays with many sideflows is just a well-known whole range.
The engine on the boat cooks the light water instead of the bag and whoever puts his hand in the water will pull out the oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves refer to the earth as black points of medicine, rarely the existing trees leave their leaves hanging sadly.
We're looking for bird breeds that usually occur in wet areas: Once the engine is quiet on the boat, it spreads in the previous paradise, where it smells like a pump, terrible silence.
"What is happening here is the ecological management of the war," says sadly Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear of health."
The war comparison is legitimate.
The area of the settlement of Ogoni is a battlefield where it has been fighting for several decades: more than 60 years ago the first inhabitants of Europe were included here, where in the 1980s the first deviation with the later rectifier Ken Saro-Wiwa was created, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it was extremely dangerous for employees.
To date, the Ogoni area must not be returned to the company: while every day seeking a delta of the three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5,000 desirable gardens and 7,000 kilometres of management more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil field in the Ogoni area lies by ship, the situation is very unstable for the group.
Every hundred meters are covered by the water steel structure as bizarre juices: "Natural trees", so they are called very gently the heads of gardens.
They're 50 years old, most of them up to the sea.
Every moment, the head of the garden opens, reports Akpobari, and then flows a constant stream of oil into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres of oil have flown into the delta in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil that has flown into the sea in Alaska during the "Exxon Valdez" supertanker disaster 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
There are disputes about who is still responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell Group marks sabotage and organised oil theft for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protectionists speak of the head of the garden and of the uncomfortable management as the main cause.
Shell requires much less safety regulations in Nigeria than is usual in the world, directed by US scientist Richard Steiner in 2008: Only the number of injuries on the lead is "a few times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks far away as a deserted, oil-sprayed shop under the sky, it is derived from the mangroves of the building: they are completely wet and up to the neck of the oil.
Under one of the many courts, which are partly linked to management, partly voluntarily distributed throughout the country, fires fire: illegal small refinery.
The oil in the court over the fire heats for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
Go ahead from the lead to the gripping mass of gasoline, later the cape at the end of the kerosene and finally oil.
This is how Michael and his four employees produce up to four judges a day for 300 litres: "We'll see 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The population of the deltas use the chronic lack of fuel in the largest oil country in black Africa.
Niger owns only one refinery.
A ridiculously low price of 40 cents euros per litre of oil can still kill illegal producers: because they have raw materials for free.
It comes from the "bunkers", which connect to the management everywhere in Ogoni: according to experts, the Niger Delta region loses at least 16 million litres of oil daily.
But only a relatively small portion of the temporarily stored raw material will be illegally exploited: The largest proportion of organised criminal networks, to which they must also belong the politics and high status of the army representatives, to tankers and sell it on the world market.
In the debate, whether they caused the disaster of the inhabitants and their actions or the lax way of production, Akpobari's activist considered it purely academic.
"If oil companies weren't considered to be firefighters and if they weren't completely destroying the vitality of fishermen, then there would be no sabotage, no theft, and no illegal refinery."
In the meantime, however, the Ogoni relationship to Shell is so damaged that it only takes into account the departure of the group: "Maybe other nations like the Chinese show up as better."
Michael's gonna be upset.
"The worst time to disappear," says the evaporate manufacturer.
"Every minute soldiers can come."
If they find a special military unit, they're not at risk of prison, but of a painful payment.
Also soldiers, most of whom come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw materials.
"Then the damn thing got our land in all respects to the bottom," Akpobari says.
The investigators found a dangerous construction error in A380 engines
A380 clearly has a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered at the time of the machine's inspection, which was forced to land, a possible construction error that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The Qantas airline wants to appeal to the engine manufacturer.
Qantas airbus passengers had probably more luck at the beginning of November than has been known: the Australian Air Safety Authority has discovered a major safety hazard on the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations - and now warns against possible construction failure.
Perhaps the confusion would have serious consequences: a single oil link could lead to disturbances due to consumption, this Thursday was announced in a published statement by the ATSB.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
This is the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 aircraft.
These include the airbus of Qantas, which had to arrive in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
She argued with the Australian Court of Justice in Sydney, which allows for further legal measures against this company.
The leader of Qantas Alan Joyce said his company would claim compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released and you damaged the nose area.
Rolls-Royce identified the cause of the damage to the burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be exchanged around the world.
Australian investigators have announced that they will perform further safety tests with giant aeroplanes equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, spokesperson for ATSB Martin Dolan.
The lack of security was considered important enough to inform everyone concerned.
After the emergency arrival of the Qantas, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380 on the ground.
Lufthansa exchanged one A380 engine as a security measure.

Global snow causes chaos in transport
All of Germany in white: almost all of the country snowed through the night.
On many roads, government chaos, train connections and planes are broken.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is cold Germany: almost the whole Republic fell on Thursday night at freezing temperatures of snow - leading in many places to traffic chaos.
In the north and east, it lies in some places up to 15 centimeters of snow.
On several roads and many roads there is a very limited transport.
At A7 in Flensburg, the road service was still in operation, but it did not manage the newly built snow.
To that end, there was still a strong blasting wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Baltic Sea coast of Schlesvik-Holštýnsk is expected to have a stormy water flow at 1.2 metres above normal by the Colombo Authority for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH).
The snowflakes in Saska caused significant problems on the roads and public roads.
According to the bad weather centre Meteomedia was therefore a degree of fear of wind - even the highest degree in the UK.
From there, a 30 - inch [30 cm] new snow came up, strong and fresh winds caused the wind to blow.
There were several freight and personal cars left in the night.
In Saska-Anhaltsk too, police authorities reported major road problems.
On A2 caused the wind and snow slow operation and the shocks.
In Durynsk there were problems with snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German route, there are major difficulties in Saska, Saska-Anhaltska, Durynska and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on wheels, turned trees on wheels or broken top management and escape.
In the Saska, a remote operation from Lipska to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Duryn Saalfeld, he had to stop one ICE to Munich.
165 passengers received on the train from the firemen and the rescuers rolled blankets, food and drink.
The snow wind was rolling over the road.
On large German airports, snow winds have been canceled for many years.
According to the speaker, information centres for years have already been reported from Munich's cancelled years.
In Frankfurt, after Mohan, it's been abolished for 40 years, according to Fraport's spokesman.
The maintenance of the roads is in a constant setting.
Although there were only a few unconnected passengers at the airport, 400 full beds were prepared for them.
On many roads there were accidents on Wednesday night.
One truck driver died last night on a train crossing in eastern Holštínsk.
The engineer was easily injured.
Because of the snowed road, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg: the truck was also caught here on the rail crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver's dead.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until early hours.
And to that end, a 30-year-old woman died after she turned her car into a sloppy road at Ashchenburg.
Meteorologists, however, have good news: snow will remain in the form of light reading, and that is why the wind will rise at light bursts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only at the Baltic Sea there will be quick winds about the power of the wind.
But it's going to be a big winter - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for twins
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye with its mark: according to one newspaper contribution, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in the main headquarters in Frankfurt.
Real estate could amount to EUR 500 million.
Deutsche Bank has just refurbished its seat of the group: the twins in the Frankfurt banking district were modernised; in the meantime, the bankers were able to go back to their old jobs.
Now, however, it is likely that the financial group wants to renovate again - and is looking for buyers for both dark traps, as "Financial Times Deutschland" informs with a call to the speaker.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We're still testing whether it's more meaningful properties to own or sell and then rent again," he said.
This is what the largest credit institution in Germany will soon give up its business home.
The bank took the twins only in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investors of its own fund and then refurbished them in a cost-effective manner.
Energy conversion is estimated to be around EUR 200 million.
I think he'd be able to sell a lot of money to the bank.
The experts in the field estimate, according to the newspaper, the value between the tower's named "Greenovers" at a price of about €500 million.
The speaker said it was not decided whether the building would be resold to the property of the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of dust for dead miners
More than 10,000 people have been memoryed by sleepwalkers in New Zealand, who have been declared dead after several explosions down.
It has not yet been able to free the dead, because the security situation is still complicated in the box.
Almost two weeks ago, the Pike River Mine came near the town of Greymouth to a strong explosion.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were loaded down.
In the case where the accident occurred, the probe was released, but there was no trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, the safety of the rescue force could not be achieved.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts came from the fact that the miners no longer have a chance to survive.
Still couldn't get rid of the dead.
Now they've memorized the memory of dead relatives and friends.
At Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand, tens of thousands of people gathered in the sunlight.
They shut up for two minutes.
The 29 tables, helmets, lamps, and the names of the miners were built to honor the memory of the sleeping miners.
Also pictures and personal things, such as clothes and surfing plots, have found their place here.
In state government buildings, there were half-hungry flagships.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would again leave the "deep ground" on the surface, the Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key told the participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he saw his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was stabbed down.
A number of foreign diplomats have also taken part in the commemorative action, except for the Prime Minister and the relative victims.
During the October 19th explosion, British and South African miners were also attacked.
The rescuers began by firing fires inside the coal valley on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the poisonous gas is released, it begins to cool the high temperatures inside, police president Gary Knowles told reporters.
Damn it, warrior!
Does the horror fit in with the art movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to recapture the old border with his battle-exposure "Wallalla Rising".
What kind of audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn mean by "Wallalla Rising"?
The captured Viking warrior with a single eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released from his torturers and in the big one they kill with the supernatural force of their opponents - it sounds ideal for young pan-viewers who are looking for bloody actions, because our hero helps with cruel methods of killing and his enemies fight even the inside of the belly of life when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, the One, as it is actually called, will not say a word during the entire film, and the other characters will take up at least one or two sentences or let them be touched by the passionate dying screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and nestled in a very beautiful hilly area of Scotland, which offers a world scene of Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for the adult enthusiasm of cinema with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera recordings.
It's good to have a movie of more target groups, it's only bad to get out of each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylish trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered a Danish version of director Quentin Tarantina, but stands out against his works to get closer to either a more humorous main stream or a less brutal artistic audience.
Most of the beneficiaries of the art cinema are probably allowed to be dealt with everywhere with the squeezing of the brain and the interior.
The reception of the action films will be cancelled at the latest when One Eye is released for clear reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries aboard the ship to Jerusalem and will remain hanging for all eternity in the wind and clouds before it seems to add power to America and continues to be silent.
So it's not surprising that in Germany Wallalla Rising didn't get into a movie and now it was only released on DVD.
It's damage mainly to the beautiful pictures, but also because it's a personal facade, places to shed blood, it's hiding exciting movies that deserve a little attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a precise event, it's all an atmosphere, a hot dream that became a film.
And it's not for a runaway viewer.
The reef does not harm him even the moment of relaxation and slowly breathes him with its cold shots and cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, especially the indescribable hate that bursts from the heart.
Only a little blonde boy who helps One-Eye, leaves something like innocence, all the others are driven by evil.
Of all the most unique hero whose motives are never explained, which will become time for enemies and transitional alliances as a warrior from hell, perhaps a messenger of the Devil.
It makes a loss, but maybe it's just for the wounded.
Wallalla Rising is a mysterious film that is possible to hate and admire, for anger, excitement and admiration.
The badge.
Dedicated groundwork
The IAEA Nuclear Power Authority has a new focus on the secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country, however, refrains from speaking - and does not allow control.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli warplanes F-15 I will attack a mysterious quarter building in Syria.
It stands on the bank of Euphrates; the nearest city is 30 kilometres away and it is called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Nuclear Power Authority (IAEA), its name appears when it refers to a reactor that allegedly built Syria with the help of North Korea in this quarter hidden in the valley that turns away from the current.
On the basis of the US-US foreign secret service CIA from the end of April 2008, a reactor, also known as the nearby village of El-Kibar, would be well placed on the production of plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
The technology from the '50s doesn't apply to anything else.
The CIA introduced video with unencumbered satellite images.
Computer animation has explained where the components of the reactor could have been before the destruction should be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
In addition, there were still photographs showing the building close to or even inside.
The reactor was probably short before the launch, but it's still out of fuel.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it's not much more than ten times, even the battles have increased over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that the CIA had been very sure before the attack that Syria was building in an el-Kibar reactor, but basically had no basis for "an active nuclear programme" in the country.
Some of the reporting secret services in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of "reputable reactor", although the CIA's presentation is considered to be "reliable".
They lack clear evidence, as do the IAEA.
On the question of how certain he has a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat answered in summer, the IAEA has "a wealth of material to ask questions".
Supposedly, "unused military buildings" were quickly removed by the Syrians, and they also properly leveled the area.
However, in June 2008, the IAEA team managed to find former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in the uranium tracks of El Kibar, which was produced by people.
In addition, the IAEA received a satellite photo of commercial sellers across the Member State from the time of the attack, which should be more extensive than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these recordings are not on the market because they were exclusively purchased by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
It is therefore not possible for the IAEA to confirm their validity.
Syria has always claimed that she never had a secret nuclear program or a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, it failed the IAEA after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damasek has been refusing to discuss things - as well as satellite images.
In addition, he banned the auditors from second inspection in El Kibar and access to the trouble-bombed building.
But Israel is also in a state of silence.
"We will never comment on it," said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently.
The investigation of this case will be carried out without delay since June 2008 and "become a serious problem in view of the Authority's credibility", as the senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admitted - it is, however, a serious breach of the Nuclear Weapons Convention that the IAEA monitors.
The IAEA considers the key to further progress in the case of three other devices that are to be "in functional connection" with the given reactor - and, unlike this, they still exist.
The auditors have not done so far, either of which equipment is one, or of which function or why they are suspected.
According to the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA is internally designated as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, taken again by nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found them on satellite imaging complex buildings, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
It is likely that there is an inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - that is why Syria rejects IAEA's approach to these three places.
In Vienna it was announced that the Syrians are afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be first sent to the United States to set up military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the U.S. secret service.
The IAEA has bases and satellite images that between these three places and the quarter of the Euphrates transported the material here and there.
In Vienna, a high Western diplomat said that at least one facility should be "in relation to fuel production".
However, there is no "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. the enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by uranium, which is not enriched.
However, where the uranium comes from, and where it should be dumped later on, plutonium on the bomb, there are only possible estimates for these central questions.
It is also not known whether the cares that might hide important traces are hidden in these three places.
As if they disappeared from the surface of the earth’s hundreds of freight vehicles, no one seems to have any information where the net came from.
Only a few kilometres away from El Kibar and on the other side of the Euphrates lies the salt work of al-Tibni, which let Syria check in 1998 as an appropriate radioactive waste stock, the IAEA considers it unlikely.
Former inspector IAEA Robert Kelley put him in touch with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from space show that, after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out land work at all suspected locations and removed large containers.
It could have been an accident, but it couldn't explain the suspicion.
In addition, the diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent many months making a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only this effort shows how much the auditors' interest is.
In the meantime, the lady also rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna were still calmed by the fact that the reactor is destroyed, and therefore the thing is not burning, the US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about so-called special inspections, which is one of the most solid means that the Vienna nuclear authority has to launch controls.
The head of the IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose an inspection, has already referred to the "prosperity to which I am staying in the future", but it is still valid.
This option poses a major risk: on the one hand, the majority of the IAEA Governing Council is needed and many of the 35 countries represented are certainly not interested in escalating.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they don't find anything?"
Love at the time of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on the still unrestricted residential facilities in summer, problems have arisen.
She wrote her own script about the loving story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not yet known - but it also causes calmness.
In the long run, the Muslim woman fell in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's teams immediately protested, so the planned film from Sarajevo to Hungary was moved quickly.
In the meantime, the film has been filmed in Hungary and is in post-production, but in Bosnia it is still protesting.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women's War Victims wrote through the UN organisation to help UNHCR refugees Jolie and asked for a meeting with the heretic, now informed the Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also a UN refugee charity.
It's not just diplomatic - she offered women weeks ago to meet in Hungary, but they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
In the camps where he was raped, the story of mercy was unknown, and Jolie's attitude toward the victim is showing enough about the scenario.
Her organization therefore recommended that the UN help refugees to leave Jolie as a embassy, the Guardian informs.
What scene did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given permission to read its script, followed by smaller drawings in Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author stresses that there is no political intention in his film that she has made a great effort to commit to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all the parties involved.
In view of the content, it remains uncertain.
Another version of the film on the Internet that sounds really different: the lovers knew themselves before the war began and met again when she was as a Bosnian Muslim dragged into the Serbian camp, where he served as a guard.
Which really sounds quite different than "the victim of rape falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie's really starting before the war is true.
Jolie claims that she is under pressure that "is not fair and is based on misinformation".
Now they can release them from Hollywood's hackers: By publishing illegally on the Internet her script, as they've done many times.
Nothing but gone
This evening it's good for Iry once again.
He's not even walking through grief.
The home team dominates very much over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout joy for the sound of loud music, ass feet.
Bailey-Pub in South Cork is hot, because players throw tennis balls three meters away into beer boilers - and they hit.
"Privní pong" is called a bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and to that end a flight to Las Vegas to the world's beer pong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this heated beer game and withholding computer, it doesn't work very well together.
However, the 26-year-old man is trying to have fun, to respond to the heavy question that brings the future.
His plan is not to play passion in Las Vegas, he goes to New Zealand in January.
"I have such a strange feeling," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there yet."
Yet: His friend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "he immediately got his dream job as an EventManager, maybe it's a good sign," says a young man and smiles.
Because of the poor appearances at home, they have tried their luck abroad for two of the three relatives of Tanners.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now serves as an IT consultant in London.
Boys leave: Like Tanners, it looks like it in many families on the island.
100 000 Irish leave the country in due time, the experts of the scientific institute for the economy and social affairs of ESRI in Dublin predict.
They even count by 2015 with 200,000 immigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, a similar exhilarating wave that Ireland suffered in the 1980s will occur.
After a decade of rise, which brought great blessings to Ireland, discontent is growing again.
The economic crisis destroys, above all, the young, educated Irys, who have experienced only a rise.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in these years.
Everyone needed it, the money was too much.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men within 30 years are unemployed.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from readers who complain: "Everything goes from hill to hill in Ireland."
"It should come up against politicians and bankers - who can, however, go away and our country loses the whole generation."
"The last one to die, please."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, the president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black, because the government only cares and the young people offer no prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but have no strategy to create new jobs," says a 20-year-old.
He notices her associates moving from one unpaid practice to another.
Her greatest concern is that she'll have to move herself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnnon are trying to see the topic positively.
McLarnnon organizes a "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers an overall service on the subject of work abroad.
"For beginners in the labour market, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on a career score," says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on a snowboard in Canada.
The report is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but freedom and joy.
About what it's like to build something somewhere else, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues for construction in Germany.
He's just building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he goes to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan gets a rare home because he works in extra shifts so he can pay home a loan on the house.
"Sometimes the situation is really a little crazy," she says, when the first time in a long time goes beyond the dust of her own home.
"I'm making money in Germany at home in Ireland, where I'm not at all."
He laughs in despair and walks in cold rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, parked in the driveway a great expensive car.
O'Donovan bought a house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100% funded by the loan.
"It was a crazy time, easy money was without a lot of questions," he says.
He's afraid it wouldn't have been good with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, comes down with hot tea, and says, "I don't have the kids that I should live and I'm young; even if it's all over, I can start again."
A construction engineer doesn't like a call that he's hearing so often.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it was on this island," he says.
"For a while to work abroad, it's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like the Irish."
She laughs and then tells about her father, who left for the last economic crisis in England.
"After seven years he was back again and his life has flown further into Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep an open future and just wait for how life will develop elsewhere.
He's been working in London for several years, and why shouldn't it be in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend too?
But there's one more thing that worries him pretty much these days: celebrating his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she might get used to the wedding party.
"Mostly no emotions," she says and drinks a good beer.
"Good-bye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a departure celebration, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Common Practices of Democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private business.
Punctuality causes greater anxiety than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latin barometer survey that took place in 18 countries and came out exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it is possible to monitor changes in situations across the board.
In the survey this year, which took place in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first is that Latin America has a rather happy mood.
The second is to increase the stability of positions towards democracy and its key institutions.
The support of democracy in several countries on the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth averaged 6% annually since 2002, support for democracy rose from at least 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
She also grew up in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most popular areas, are democratic beliefs, which is the regional average (see Graph 2).
About 44% of respondents across the board expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in their country of practice, which is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001 when it was 25%, it is a big increase (Graph 3).
The 34% survey indicated that they believed in the snow in their country and 45% believed in the government, again being the same numbers as last year, but it was a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis was undermined by democracy in Latin America.
Support arose during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the stronger social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and decreased again to 32% this year.)
However, the gap changes widely from country to country (see Graph 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its retreating President Luize Inácia Luly da Silva, is reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the situation of violent criminal activity worsened.
Only once since the surveys began, more respondents across Latin America see as the most important problem of crime rather than unemployment (see Graph 5).
The 31% survey says that either they themselves or their close relatives have become victims of criminal activity last year, but this is a decrease compared to 38% of the data last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
The more massive economic performance is reflected in growing support for private business and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the board say that private business is necessary for development, this percentage increased by 56% from 2007 (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that enables their countries to develop, this percentage grew from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelan respondents have the same opinion (and 80% support private business), although their left-wing President Hugo Chávez has many private companies.
Brazil is a country that has a leading position in the area as mentioned by 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, versus last year without change) and Venezuela (9%, versus 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, and Venezuela is pleased with the success of Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Critical Options
No one expected the general elections in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders who were trying to help the affected country to fear.
Elections were marked by filling the hours and repeating voting, voting cards scattered by channels, broken polling rooms and intimidation.
Election rooms open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced for the reason of the January earthquake, wandered around and tried to find out where they could go to vote.
Some of them finally gave it up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a few pre-supposed predecessors, shouted that it was a fraud and called after the elections were cancelled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, a highly established United Nations official in Haiti, said that "in many respects it was quite a good choice."
Observers from the Organization of the American States and the Caribbean Community have carefully said that "they do not believe that these inequalities, however serious, did not necessarily have to cancel the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opposition votes are bound to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing President and his candidate Jude Célestin, shall announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is planned for ice.
All the election hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, withdrew from their original challenge to declare the vote invalid.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or no support between the voters, is marked by the electoral commission for reaching a decisive battle.
Because of the regular epidemic of hell and more than 1 million people who still live in states after the earthquake, fear that the election will be low.
Finally, many Haitians wanted to vote, but for the sake of disorganization, they were prevented from doing so.
A total of 250 thousand IDs necessary for voting have been left undistributed.
There's a lot in the bet.
Gifts see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a fundamental step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it's clear, then, that the Haitians are on their own.
By the point to the center
In the weeks, when suddenly the widow, Cristina Fernández, the Argentine President, was moved by public sympathy when her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this success into a successful campaign for the second functional period in elections next year may depend on whether the grieving Mrs Fernández gives incompatibility to her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And it's all going to be based on these signs.
Mr Kirchner, who continued in economic policy even after his wife had successfully become president, was accustomed to drawing up budgets that contributed to tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to lose another income according to their liberty.
Mrs Fernández's government lost most last year in Congress.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized at the death of Mr. Kirchner on October 27th.
Some members of the ruling political movement, Peronist, joined Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic sessions (in which the government's fraud and accusations had occurred), Congress was unable to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to come," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also be paid for the next year, with more space for the president to lose as a result of the librarianism.
The economy is overheating: this year is likely to grow to 9%.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and experts are talking about the figure that is approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who went to the office in 2003, when Argentina narrowed its economic collapse, set a priority on growth and poverty reduction rather than on inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, charged the private sector and cleared the INDIC, a statistical agency that has joined the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now calm down this policy?
She called for a discussion between private businesses and committee remittances.
And her officials say they want to limit wages growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the increase in world prices for the export of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on a major devalvation in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández is aware that he wants to renew Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government established an agreement with the debtor who had previously refused to restructure the debt which Argentina had not paid in 2001.
Now, President Fernández's deal with the religious governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted on not having this reality under the supervision of the IMF as usual.
But last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which will remind the introduction to clean up INDIC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of the term of office when the husband is no longer on her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get the support of the middle class, which is tired of ecclesiasticalism.
At the time of the return of the Argentines from the summer vacation they have in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If he wants to win another election, he will have to decide whether it is necessary to speak quietly to many of the opinions that her husband stood up to in politics.
Half-incentives for China
The Taiwanese voters are closer to a tighter connection to the fortress.
How does Taiwan feel about its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million volunteers, 70% of the eligible, elected on 27 November of the mayor's office and city councils in five urban districts, which can be considered to be a broader assessment by President Ma Ying-jeu.
Mr. President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that have prevailed and have been strongly established in business relations, including in part free trade agreements, in the greatest alignment of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed a test, but only close.
Although his party Kuominang (KMT) finished winning three out of five mayors, she failed to win most of the votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is in favour of greater independence in Taiwan, received almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If it were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote rate has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party was together with KMT in city councils.
The elections were held as a majority of Taiwanese elections, which include sound election trucks and mass assembly with flags with low-level girls.
Part of it was even a secret attempt to murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chana, honorary president of KMT, was agitated for KMT candidates in the pre-election evening.
The man in the van shot young Mr. Lien right through his face, wounded her and killed the viewer.
It was by no means determined whether the armed man intended to harm Mr. Lien or to settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the DPP leader, claims that the shooting has affected the elections, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads the voters towards KMT.
Probably the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how she remained in the background of the question of the foundation itself.
Instead, the candidates lost their jobs with regard to state housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
So KMT tends to avoid ties to government in Beijing.
But this time DPP also left behind the incitement of anti-Chinese positions.
It is a response to reality and is aware that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. President Ma confirmed on his part that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
From the government in Beijing it can be expected that it will continue in commercial payments, together with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to its state.
China did not waste time sending the negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course they would also like to see political integration, but in particular.
It will be better to wait after the 2012 presidential elections.
In any case, the DPP found itself.
Two years ago she was at a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on the basis of corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a fighter and a leader of clear independence.
But under Mrs. Tsai's leadership, a new generation has developed, which is calmed down and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs. Tsai was called as a DPP candidate for the presidency, such as Su Tseng-change, who was standing under Mr. Chen.
Their parties are now doing their best to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms Tsai published plans for research institutes that serve as a contact point between DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without previous conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party is a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's surprising approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be angry with this move.
In a declaration issued by his own country, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would be better off if they insisted that Taiwan was a single country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, pragmatics, not to be a president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight the choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's assessment was wrong, even through the excessive pace of economic growth; KMT's candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
Its illiteracy seems to be based, in particular, on unemployment and deepening the gap between the rich and the poor.
Speaker KMT says he reorganizes his office, as well as local branches.
Strongly requested proposals to support Taiwan to connect friendly contacts are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonia Chiang, the prominent advertiser, "the point from which there is no return has already fallen."
Awards at Grammy: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of the best new artist
A speech at the president's request, and people must observe the law.
Esperanza Spalding, 26 years old jazz bassette and singer, chosen by President Obama to attend the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, is marked as one of Grammy's surprises in this year with the best new artist nominations in the category.
In view of the fact that Spalding has been celebrated on the jazz stage since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" came out, it came a bit late, but it is in accordance with Grammy's rules, when the artist must not issue more than three albums before "the public identity of the given artist is established."
Her ambitious album from 2010 "Chamber Music Society" certainly recorded a step forward and thanks to her carefree vocal style and hand-held with elements of pop, funk and Latin influence, we can talk about Spalding as the success that Norah Jones recorded in 2003, the closest equivalent for voters in Gramma who are looking for similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
Other jurors Grammy rightly rated the album Vijay Iyer Trio "History" in the category of instrumental album, exciting, refreshing the ride of the album, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against James Moody's experienced saxophoneist "Moody 4B" and John Beasley's "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a brave favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in the HBO series "Treme" was rated in the current jazz category, which is otherwise suited to the albums of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lober.
The savage group Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with the knowledge of stampunk received several merited recognitions in the category of large files, when in competition the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how to have the base free hand as a chapel.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music category
The classic music nominations at Grammy's 53rd annual prices have a wide selection of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The leading position in the nomination has Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machine" for piano and orchestra, with five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominated prisoners in Southern California were Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The founder of L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has a chance to appreciate it.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories that include orchestral, operal, congregational and solo recordings.
The category for the producer of classical music year has five nominees, including Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Bruckner and his Symphony were nominated 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" from Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals project; "Sacrifium - the Art of the Castrati" introducing various artists; and Verdiho "Requiem" from Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As for the category of operas, the appointments are Berg and "Luu" from Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" from Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" from Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and Ivanhoe from BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers who are nominated to Grammy for contemporary compositions are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had a premiere at Disney Hall in January 2009, which was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under Esa-Pecka Salonen.
About 30 minutes' work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnet Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for an instrumental soloist with an orchestra.
The author from L.A. stated that he had written a 15-minute work specifically for the Mandolin Avi Avital, who was performing at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble, located in New York City.
"I wrote it with the help of sounds from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone conversation.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, received nominations in the category for orchestral performance, led by Chicago Symphony in recording the work of Stravinska.
Among the instrumental soloists who received the nominations are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; fortune teller Paul Jacobs; housemaker Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were represented among the nominated vocal soloists this year, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Bruegergosman.
In the class transition category she won the nomination of Soprano Jesse Norman for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mix in Temecule is approved by the Planning Commission
The planned mix in Temecule received unanimous support from the local planning commission over five hours of intensive public witnessing.
Critics attacked the project that promotes terrorism and will lead to a stop to trade.
However, the jury decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre is in accordance with local laws and will be aesthetically effective.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you remember," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means that justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" added.
"Those who are opposed only shout out loud."
"We have really great people in our valley."
The event began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time they held discussions with people who were for or against the centre. These voices were evenly distributed, reported Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the website of the news.
"There is no America anymore," one comment appeared.
"We are the planet monkeys with Socho's freedom falling into the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centre also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including the vicinity of Ground Zero, the places of tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community of about 135 families went to Riverside County for years without an incident, but wanted more and more space than the storage space that he rented together with the manufacturer of filtering systems.
A new mix of 24 943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minerals and an increase to 43 feet.
It should take a 4,32 acres of space on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
As regards the project, opponents can still appeal to the City Council.
Microbes with arsenic resistance increase the possibility of new types of life on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the space for finding new forms of life on Earth and perhaps even further.
Researchers have discovered unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has options that are beyond the main elements that have been considered and fundamental to date.
"That organism has two abilities."
"It can grow either by phosphorus or arsenic."
"This reality is very special, but it is not evidence that it is a form of truly 'foreign' life," noted Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report, which appeared on Thursday in the online issue of Science magazine.
It has long been considered necessary for the life of six main elements - coal, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and cheese.
However, scientists have found that the bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow once the arsenic is replaced by phosphorus.
"You're starting to wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is important for finding life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know how life can look, said Anbar.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
However, a report on this newspaper was published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the finding, called for broad online speculation that the report reveals the discovery of foreign life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms can be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that now the elements we consider to be 'standard' must not be so necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't an accident.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiological Institute at NASA, who conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because she showed high arsenic levels.
Arzen and phosphorus are very similar chemical elements, so she thought that microb, which is exposed to both elements, could be able to replace each other.
"Arzen is poisoned mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can hardly separate these elements from themselves."
"Also arsenic is so different that it does not work like phosphorus. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to an increasing concentration of arsenic that are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better when they act as phosphorus, but given that they can survive also with a substitute arsenic, the possibility that the form of life that uses arsenic may appear naturally, whether elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or month, where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, is not new, but there was never an example to show.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on earth, she said, and the scientists speculated that she could be used in earlier forms of life.
"This means that there could be other ways to create life, not only in the way that it was created in the early era of the Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining thefts of dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs that someone stole from Bellflower's motel were found.
Four exhibition dogs - two minutes and the chief pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at Motel Bellflower 6, told the authorities.
Two dogs were found in the middle of the afternoon and two dogs were left in the middle of the night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles area.
"The good news is that dogs are okay," said Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, at which location, did not share any detailed information regarding their findings.
"Research continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not arrested to speak for the case.
They were delighted to find their two minutes in the middle of the afternoon in a shelter in Downey.
The sheriff's representatives found a van and two dogs separated in Compton.
Action Trace, three-year-old Trace dog and 10-month-old didi, were unharmed, reported to the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek tribe, who had planned to participate in this week of district competition on behalf of their Japanese owners, were not found until their appearance late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are this weekend in town to attend AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions planned on the days before the show AKC/Eukanuba show, said The Times of Poek on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on almost a month's travel by dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered at the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - the dog boxer, the Parson Russell terrier and the British oven - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where they were supposed to be colder.
They've opened the windows a little bit so that dogs in the car have enough fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported car theft at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who brought them to the missing dogs, dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
It wasn't clear on Thursday that prices would be paid.
Lev is again ready to scream now that the restructuring of MGM has obtained final approval from the court
After 18 months of shock and uncertainty, MGM finally got green to start again.
On Thursday, the Federal Insolvent Judge of New York officially blessed the "before the packaged" plan of creditors to balance about $5 billion in debt and clear the road for 86 years by the old entertainment company, which focuses on the production and production of films and television shows.
Fourthly, that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. competition order, MGM does not leave any legal impediments to the relaunch of the founders Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the main leaders of the simplified study.
The number of employees will decrease by 320 from the originals to more than 400.
MGM does not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11, until JPMorgan Chase agrees on the planned financial resources enabling a loan of $500 million to finance new MGM operations and production.
Now it's about connecting to an investment bank, which itself needs $75 million and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when Moelis & Co. was hired by the investment bank to advise management on resolving its finances, as management was fighting to allow interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, the former Director General of Enron and an expert at the company, who knew his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelise's and Cooper's attempts to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 study believers took much longer than expected.
After a few months of discussion, the parties agreed that by the end of 2009 they were selling the company.
Although auctions attracted several interested parties, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus funding that believers demanded.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the believer at the end of October.
When MGM officially resigns from the competition in the following weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive a multi-hamilion dollar bonus for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive $9.5 million.
Co-operatives who are incarcerating for their services that run the company, $375 000 a month, will receive a reward for their success, i.e. "success fee" $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to renew their production in MGM, which only released one film this year and to put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will be released in early 2012.
They are also planning to contribute to the financing of two films whose presentation will be the "Hobit" book, along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of these two films that Peter Jackson will direct.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debts, was looking for the possibility of joining the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, which is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies did not enter into an agreement.
Technology toys that will keep your budget on the balance
This year's leading candidate is the most amazing iPad player followed by the video game system. In both cases it is a significant contribution to the gift budget.
Consider that at the price of one iPad you can buy five rounds of BMX for $99 and one game Kinect stands the same as 10 coral lighters or about 48 kilns Play-Doh.
But there's a way to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy salesmen - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law was working; this year's technological toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not lower, compared to the past years.
While relatively few new games have appeared with associated websites, two of the most famous players of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin are offering more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as is the battery battery charging.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices indicated are from Toys "R" Us, except for cases otherwise specified.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, 3 years old) are a lye animal that sings when you push them a whistle.
At one push, the animal emits a tone and the other push begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start playing, you can't stop.
The best choice in singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, 2 years)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animated doll from Elmo Live, who can play Simon Says and can also take a month's walk thanks to its innovative, colloquial foot.
Children test Mickey's dance instructor's toy, even though their parents complain about lack of voice control.
If you are an 80-year-old child, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years old), with a bag full of quiz cards that are designed to turn the driver into a fun with work with a self-corrected, funny work kit.
If you're sending for your child's smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest option with easy use, with qwerty keyboards, although games do not have as effective education as Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change in the Leapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children from 8 years of age) is a file of five cubes that are not larger than a box than a lighter, each of them has an LED display.
The aim is to create words by placing the cubes in a row before time expires; it is great for competition in improvised word creation.
Still more toy has at least some kind of online connection.
At the highest level, two Webkins and Club Penguin players were represented in toys.
If you want your child to buy an online player from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains coins with hidden code.
When you activate online code, your child will get enough credit in Club Penguin store store on any two items.
That could include a wheel brush or a puffle animal.
About something a little bigger than your toothbrush is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years old), the latest of the number of microbots on the button battery.
Bruk moves fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It's fun when you make a puzzle out of the cube and watch if he can find a way out.
He's also very strong.
Our guy was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in the background of our dog.
Introduce cleaner police control in China
As the city's military instructor, Tang Shenbin went to the square, strictly controlled his orders and issued orders with the military authority.
He wanted women members - Chinese state-run urban rulers, worried and frustrated about their hard moves and violence - to make certain impressions on the noises surrounding them.
"Get up right!"
"Come on!"
Show them, whispers quietly, "What beautiful girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive caps and pants were put on notice.
Four pairs of black boots are sorted as a square.
The four head coverings perfectly sit on the hair, which are perfectly bound by blue and white stairwells.
"I personally think they look average," said Mr. Tang.
"Models are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of the city’s overseers in China.
One city ordered new branches to have higher education.
The province of Guangdong has changed gray-green uniforms into a much more attractive blue.
In the middle of China, Wuhan replaced the contested view of a strong weapon: in 2009 a report stated that 50 officers surrounded the carriages with candles incessantly and looked down on the owners when the retailer packed and left for half an hour.
Xindu, a city period of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen surgery as the main picture.
Since 2003, he has supplemented his urban police with 13 women who have been selected specifically from their perspective, consistency and youth.
The aim is to show a more subtle, women's side, besides the rough side of the police.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson himself would have had trouble getting into secret Chinese city groups.
They'd argue the critics for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to promote the city's declaration, to impose sanctions and other administrative measures.
But Chinese media usually capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from the province of Hubei turned an unaccompanied viewer to death after he used his cell phone to film how they began in the protest case against the shipper.
Last year, police training was carried out in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the internet. In the manual, there was a different description of how to effectively beat the perpetrators without a blood mark.
This year, a underground dealer with melons in Shanghai got into a fight with five policemen and suffered a left-handed brain injury.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded online shows Chinese policemen how they attack street salesmen.
"Chenguan scared the government," China Daily, a national edition, called last year after another discussion about tactics.
There was "a really thorough cleaning" on the paper.
Skeptics say that such an approach is not possible.
After the October announcement of an interest in eight new women's policemen, the leader of The Beijing Evening News wondered whether women had real obligations or were just disillusioned.
The answer seems to be from both sides.
The district asked for women from 18 to 22 years of age with a good attitude and "five faces in the right proportion."
Adepts should be higher than the average - above 1.6 meters.
An exemption at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials claim that work is psychologically too demanding for women over 25 years of age.
"Their image is an important thing," said one unnamed police officer at Rednet.com, like government websites.
"The candidates must first show the external qualities, which then determine the other, are among them height, weight, face figures, etc."
Then comes a series of nature and inner qualities.
Women are like flower waxes, he said and added, "In addition to being bound, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, the deputy director of the district management, disagrees very much with this description.
But he argued that the requirements for height are also common in China for other jobs, both sexes.
Just like a requirement for a uniform face drawing.
Which means that the question of a good look is the subject of discussion between the Chinese.
Health problems or freezing are certainly not applicable.
"He cannot allow us to serve a chrome or a man's back," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is keeping watch at Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, face like an apple and a well-formed mouth.
She doesn't think that the focus on her perspective might be a sessistic root, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked herself with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with the docks, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our task is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just launching traders into streets where they can do their business.
Each morning, a group stands against more than ten traders running foot or bikes and tries to sell as many noodles and tofus as possible before they are removed.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you so many times!" said Ms. Xu when he started running away, and for a time he left his bike with a car with nozzles.
Politicians describe their duties as more monotonous than ours.
"Every day is basically the same," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in his free marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that women policemen have no power as their male counterparts to entertain the goods.
They can only threaten to report the facts to their male leader.
The trend is then to protect them from sudden public manifestations of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, were excited after false reports of police killing the sellers.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the night; 14 government vehicles were turned on or burned.
Xinda's escaped this kind of violence.
But peace can be guaranteed only by hardship.
Only two blocks from the quiet town of Baoguang, where police officers were watching that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The police had fun on a motorcycle that was fixed on the sidewalk in the interior of the store as required by the regulations.
The owner of the car could cry as he wanted.
15 minutes' distance from the police, face-up to the rear, with wheels against the vehicles and quickly leave with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator of the male group, remained behind, his white mark turned around to hide his name.
Like women police officers, the coordinators are men over 40 years of age who have only a helpful role to play.
Unlike them, they are not trained in the maintenance and storage of the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li forever.
"Mostly it's a public that starts with it."
Prosecutors will not accuse Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges concerning his dealings with his former campaign advisor and his efforts to secure lobby, announced the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision concludes the most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, the Nevad Republican, has faced and has, until the time of the scandal, been considered a potential Republican candidate for the president for 2012. His affair has reached national title and has damaged his career.
Mr Ensigna's office said it was a decision that followed almost after the annual investigation, "very happy".
The senator could still face disciplinary proceedings before the Senate's ethical commission.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the object of the investigation and that he is not planning to bring further charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice has refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed there was serious evidence that Mr Ensign had prepared a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Conversations, e-mails and other documents that were published in October 2009 in the New York Times stated that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby that was supposed to lead to Mr. Hampton's silence and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a treasurer in the Ensign campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after Mr. Hampton had been employed to lobby them, so much documents and talks are being presented.
Since Hampton was recently assistant to Mr Ensigna, he was excluded from the law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts claim that the unusual arrangement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were before the affair of friends, has emerged in opposition to the lobbying ban.
From the evidence that was published "it has been shown that it is a clear case of preparation for a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decisions in the case of Senator Ensigna, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the Ministry was careful with regard to political complaints, according to a large number of accidents, including the decision last year to postpone the complaint against former Senator Ted Stevens in the face of the allegations of State representation.
The federal prosecutors "had clearly hidden the weapons," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibilities and Ethics in Washington), a group of lawyers who filed several complaints against Mr. Ensignova in this matter.
"It shows, in principle, that the laws do not apply to highly established government officials," she added.
Paul Coggins, the chief lawyer of Mr Ensigna, announced in the interview that he was called on Monday by the State Representative of the Ministry of Justice and then on the second day, and told him that the ministry had not sought any charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defence team cooperates with the plaintiff in trying to convince him that the senator, as his office repeated in the middle statement, "agreed in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he submitted to the State's representatives.
"I am not pleased to count the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to suspend the investigation of the individual complaint, in which the ethical group charges that the payment of Ensigna Hamptons' parents in the amount of $ 96,000 violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbyist work was NV Energy, the leading NGO, which has been supporting the senator for a long time.
One e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began acting as a lobbyist in the company, Mr. Ensign's employees - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he had "boasted" into the Ministry on the subject under discussion.
Mr Ensign also participated in lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevadian client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after I hired Mr. Hampton at the lobby.
When Mr. Ensign first came up last year with an affair report, he apologized to his wishes and resigned to his office as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After a months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in the third election period in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer the aim of investigating the criminal act of his spokesman Jennifer Cooper, the senator has stated that he hopes that the ethical commission will follow the Ministry of Justice quickly and complete the investigation.
"Sentor Ensign is looking forward to continuing in his hard work on behalf of the Nevad people," she said.
Challenge of the county of Cheshire on Twitter
Half a dozen of them were written in a number of court-martials.
A minute later, the news of a terrible witness was broadcast on Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 news on Twitter was about rapeing and bringing children to bed in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes was remanded, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire citizens, Connecticut, families, and had to be officially terminated with the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But the lawyers of Mr Hayes have already appealed to the court with applications and arguments that the court would probably have used for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the expanded use of Twitter's main reporters - has created a "circuit atmosphere" and this expanded, immediate penetration of information with puzzling details then led to the jury in deciding whether to influence the public opinion.
This claim might cause the judge to question whether new technologies would also require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced this transformation, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the right of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the chief advocate of Mr Hayes.
The judge of the Jon C. Blue Supreme Court has briefly rejected the claim regarding the outcome of the last week and the fact that the means of communication were "very controlled" and that there is no evidence to indicate that the jury was acting under the influence of the public.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the Court has held that notorically known cases may be brought to the attention of the Court of First Instance to question the fairness of the proceedings.
In the 1966 judgment of the United States Supreme Court, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, when in his decision, he said that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, the "carnival atmosphere" was the subject of the proceedings.
Some are convinced that this criminal act was an inspiring TV show and film "Spring".
Some lawyers said that the appeals brought by Hayes' judgment of half a century later could be surprised by the argument that new rules might be necessary to determine how to communicate from a judicial point of view, which in the case of Dr. Sheppard was unimaginable.
"There is a general reason for fears about the impact of new media" in the highly monitored cases, said John J. Donohue III, professor of law Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was done voluntarily.
Professor Donohue stated that some judges might be tempted to think that a restriction of immediate communication from a judicial point of view could make the trial more just.
The Twitter case is only one of many of Mr Hayese's shadowed lawyers who would be able to argue for years to hold a ruling.
For example, the defendants also claim that in Mr Hayes' case, it may be assumed that when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of potential jury judges, he would show them criminal pictures of a threat in the selection of the jury.
Some of the jury said they were terrified by the photos of the victims that Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
The defendants claim that they also reject the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed the jury that was critical to the state representatives and that by his decision he wrongly imposed a greater pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The jurors were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the process can attract the greatest interest.
In opposition to the verdict made last month, they stated that the case was dominated by reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign against the governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the means of communication were constantly exhaling the flames of emotion in this case.
"The media, cameras, and reporters before the court," the lawyer wrote, "was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven and may also be a state-of-the-art rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the discussions, some reporters claimed that the immediate reporting was more disturbing than the reports later mentioned and that from their point of view the judicial police should control the scope of other proceedings.
However, some lawyers have called for appeals with often used arguments that social and technological changes require the adaptation of the courts.
Mr Hayes' lawyers are trying to do this right.
In their archives they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in the case of Dr. Sheppard, on account of the broader effect of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell in the 21st century."
Can the court prevail?
After the campaign, which was remarkable for its hostility and negativity, a small number of frauds appeared in Washington this week.
Is it the first owner of real cooperation between the two political parties or just the illusion moment before a quick return to the side fighting in the capital?
The internal meeting of President Obama and the parliamentary leaders did not bring forward any key findings on the key topics to be discussed during the meeting.
In each case, however, there was a heated discussion on the differences of views between the two parties, as well as the definition of their shared responsibilities, rather than the next empty episode of the side-carrying.
The Central Public Meeting of the President's Deficit Commission was also civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that closeness for several months has built up mutual respect, which surpasses the ideological gap that members continue to divide.
And it's pretty hard to say she started a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in the trial period - they are investigating each other's signs of collegiality and compromise, trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the willingness to endure the renewed foreign war.
Therefore, the Tuesday hearing and its subsequent assessment of the participant were also conducted with minimum demands or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republics are too wide and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the conditions that have prevailed for the last two years.
Whether it's a question of taxes, expenditure, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections were prepared by Washington at least quickly.
"There is no question whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable by choice.
The elections sparked the emotions of the parties, and then you were silent.
It's good."
In a number of questions, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have a small chance of finding solutions.
Bush's tax reduction at the end of the year has been cleared out and nobody thinks it's a favor.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, which is either permanent or temporary.
Like a possible compromise on unemployment rates only because Republicans cannot look at how they support the reduction of taxes on the property while refusing unemployment support to the unemployed.
After Tuesday's discussion in the White House, there is already a greater optimism about the possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of the new opening agreement.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship between the two political parties when the 112nd Congress calls for ice.
More likely is a period of disagreement or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing the things that have to be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in a short time," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is significantly extended - to the fact that the diocese will lead them to genuine cooperation.
"I look at all events between the present and the year 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the election of tea parties that helped create it.
The Republican leaders are now facing a danger of healing, they know that they must act in accordance with their promises and have to reduce government expenditure and abolish the new health law.
These lines are clear in the initial reactions to recommendations on the deficit, which include reform of the tax legislation and the increase of certain taxes, increase of the pensionable age and the reduction of expenditure.
The joint presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their opinion, have to develop the pressure on the issue of deficits to a public programme of ways that cannot be ignored.
However, they need 14 votes in the 18th Committee in order to present their plan as an official recommendation and therefore fight to get as close as possible to this number.
The biggest resistance is among the elected jurors who propose that, in the case of financial issues, we have, at least today, small foundations or will for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in battles between the White House and the parliamentary republics.
The first year will begin in the form of bilateral conflicts, when the Republicans call on Obama to resolve the budget, tax and health care, when the period will be followed by greater bilateral cooperation.
What's going on with the motion?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that, despite the fact that the last election is a site, most Americans still want to see two sides working together.
If it could be directed to a pat, as it was in 1995, then both sides will closely monitor the public’s reactions.
Anyone who is going to be threatened by a reduction of votes will probably change the course and look for a compromise.
That could be an optimistic view of the thing.
Pagecidality and orientation are greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and it shows that there was a greater ideological gap between Obama and the parliamentary republics than in the case of the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prerequisite for more important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, the diocese that appeared this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common foundations on issues that still divide them.
A prominent American document counts Moscow as a shelter for corruption
The city's driving is in the hands of "kleptocracy" and it continues part of the payments and protection payments coming to Kremlin, a US Embassy in Russia, in February's records.
The police and the Federal Security Service have a large number of protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They choose money not only from legal transactions but also from organised criminal groups.
Each level of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical office" - will take his own when the money starts moving up the ladder.
The record that was sent to Washington on behalf of Ambassador John Beyle was published on Wednesday through WikiLeaks on their websites.
The record is based on the sources whose name has been written.
The record was written at the time when he was still the mayor of Yuri Luzhkov and accused her of much corruption.
He was summoned in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only watch minimal changes in the clean.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelen Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, have continued to support corruption charges after many years, and has won several charges for guilty charges for such complaints.
In September, he said to the Russian TV station when he was questioned about proven evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's bullshit."
The Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will show itself to vote.
It is, however, unusual to meet with such details in such a way, which is in the ambassadorial report, and it is also unheard of that would be done by diplomats from foreign countries.
"The government of Moscow and its connection with criminal animals have led some to call it 'disfunctional,' and confirm that the government works more as a leptocracy than as a government," the report says.
"Criminal elements are enjoyed by the so-called 'krysa' (a term from the world of crime and mafia, which literally means 'cover' or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the State Representative, as well as everywhere in Moscow's government bureaucracy.
"The analysts identified a three-way structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is on his own top."
"Federal Security Service, Ministry of Interior and militias are at second level."
"And finally, at the lowest level, they're ordinary criminals and corruption inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty spaces in some areas, since the city does not provide some services."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are focusing on smaller businesses.
One source said, "Business owners in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry inside (better than organised criminal groups), since they do not only have more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer in the course."
The record says that while the choice of money is complex, protection itself may already have problems; even those who pay may sometimes be arrested.
Those who don't pay fast enough close their shops under different locks.
Medvedev talked about fighting corruption several times, but he admitted that he only made little progress.
The Embassy report speaks of men taking bags, probably heated cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said George Satarov, director of the Moscow research team India.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because there are no political classes in Russia anymore."
Without politics, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that Russia's corruption is internationally worth more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked 154th in the recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization of Transparency International (the country is listed from at least the most corrupt).
The discovery of the US Embassy's report, which appeared in Moscow until late evening hours, certainly did not provoke the Russian government's enthusiasm, although only to the extent that the Moscow deficit can be blamed for Luzhkov, it may be an opportunity for Kremlin to argue on the issue of solving the problem.
During a discussion with CNN with Larry King, Putin announced that the documents that WikiLeaks published could have been counterfeits and responded in anger to the statement that American diplomats call him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth about the whole issue is that it is about our mutual solidarity, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so unethically."
The Red Khmer Veterans are forced to deal with the past
In the light of the low-lighted concrete slabs, the director of the school, Anlong Veng High School, the man who built it, the leader of the Khmers Ta Mok, recalled.
"Everyone here loves The Mok."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sarge Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "scarlet" for its harshness during the Rudh Khmer government, the commander of this remote country of the Rudh Khmer in northwest Cambodia remains popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmer government gave up, there's a long-lasting loyalty also in Anlong Veng.
In April, the victims of the forum of truth and reconciliation were allowed publicly to confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that first explain the history of the Khmers and their former soldiers to children.
And in July the United Nations and the Cambodian Court will bring together the first sentence of former member of the Khmers, the ruling of a former leader, a notorically known violent association Tuol Slang, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With all such progress, the dissatisfaction between the Red Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng has increased, which complicates efforts to reconcile and reintegrate their attempts into Cambodian society.
"The former Khmer Khmers are a bit of a mystery and a fear, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"The life among the Red Khmers was wonderful for them, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It's family-making."
During the Cambodian Rudh Khmer government from 1975 to 1979, according to estimates, 1.7 million people have been repaired or killed by hunger, disease or reprocessing.
When the Vietnamese attacked and defeated the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they started the uprising, which lasted until the last move in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led partisan wars from their foundations in mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok was cultivating staupence in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement, sponsored by the United Nations, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to move to the government, which led to the capitalisation of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Paul Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who survived, was captured by government forces in the nearby mountains of Dangrek in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while waiting for trial.
Their mercenaries were no longer concerned with them, most of the former Red Khmer fighters fell into the ordinary Cambodian rural life and many of them nostalgically recalled the time of movement.
Although several elite Red Khmers held their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only minimal benefits from the surrender," said Sok Lang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which leads a public forum throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were educated without any idea of the realization of the trade."
Sir Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmer was good," he said.
"The Mok enjoyed all."
"But now life is hard, because we have to make sure of ourselves."
The Running Court of the Khmers has also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sarah and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Khmers.
The court has a mandate to sue the head of the detainees and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said that it will continue in four cases.
It was just a little to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was the district leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the government of the Khmers at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she was looking at the building of Trapeang Thma, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
Last couple night, Im Chaem returned from field work to his wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to rise and the shadows appeared over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past among the Khmers.
If the court had called her, she would have refused to leave.
"In Cambodia there is peace and stability," she said.
"If there's another criminal conspiracy coming up, there's a war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who passed through the Red Khmers in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court were to seek further suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury in it the past," he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, Chhang Youk from the documentation center said.
"Relievement in Khmer means the blinding of broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to give these broken pieces together so that we can understand."
The Centre issued the first textbook approved by the Government of the Khmer Republic, has 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to the history of the Ministry of Education, which contains fewer than four parties about the Khmers.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew only a few details about the Khmers, even through the city's connection with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, high school student in Anlong Veng said that the new textbook helps students understand the important components of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he took his book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will bring."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and more difficult," Sok Lang said.
But the public forum, the textbooks and the court are beginning to have an influence, he said.
The Khmers here still have a strong spell.
Up in the mountains Dangrek Mountains is the path of the old muddy and scattered plastic bags, which leads to a black-seat fence covered with a reclaimed back cover.
Paul Pota's body was burned here on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Noum Sothea, 31, a mobile salesman on the side of the road said he didn't know much about the man who was fired at that place.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Noum Sothea had a birthday and planned to visit Paul Pota's place of rest, where he would bring a bond of mature bananas in hopes of her luck.
Belarus agrees that its supplies of uranium-based weapons appear
In a surprising victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material all over the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they are surrendering their resources to highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The Agreement was published in a joint declaration issued after the Security Summit of Foreign Ministers by Hillary Rodham Clinton and by the Belarusian Minister by Sergei Martynov.
After years, the American government tried to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and it seemed that the last spring had been hit by a rock of interest.
But the US officials said The Washington Post that in the last two months, a few undercover operations have been carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons based on uranium from the Belarus research facility.
This prepared the ground for a medium-term agreement to remove the residue of material - about 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke under the terms of anonymity because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Safety Summit in April, on which Belarus was expelled.
And it was apparently a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Partnership for Global Security, a group supporting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would provide all sensitive nuclear materials worldwide for up to four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries rid themselves of all their resources of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of Obama's nuclear safety summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never surrender to its uranium.
"We have a highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically the basis for weapons and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
"It's our compost...we don't intend to produce dirty bombs and we don't intend to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, joined the United States several months ago and expressed interest in reaching the agreement.
The first obligation to remove the Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily Watched, the officials announced.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to the Russian storage and disposal facility, the officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The US government has lost $13 million for the programme, most of which to hand over to the Belarusian research institution less enriched uranium, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"Everything has been coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust," said Andrew Bieniawski, the head of the Energy Ministry working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used for the manufacture of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the Joint Declaration, endeavour to eliminate its resources by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained over the years, especially because of the harsh repression of human rights in Lukashenko.
But the average declaration indicates the possibility of a gradual decline.
"We welcome the progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that the further respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improved relations, and this is necessary for the country's progress and its inhabitants," he said.
The Spanish government didn't work with the CIA's years of dragons.
The Spanish government has not made any money on the CIA's flight of prisoners and members of Al-Qaida to Guantanama over the Spanish territory, as the United States envoy in Madrid said in his telegram.
It follows from the documents provided by the server of Wikileaks El País, where it is also written that then Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vegová asked to be informed by the Spanish executive and "could thus show that he has appropriate supervision over foreign aircraft flying Spanish airspace".
in June 2006, following a communication from the Council of Europe, in which tens of thousands of States, including Spain, were accused of engaging in human rights violations, a meeting was held between the US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy Prime Minister said that the Council of Europe's Communication "extended Zapater's government from the game" and insisted that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
De La Veg stressed that Spain has no problem with the years of secret services across its territory.
"They just want to be informed," said Aguirre in one of the documents.
The then Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Ángel Moratinos pointed out to the US embassy that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter as low as possible, but because it was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited influence".
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente González informed Velvyslanectv that, as far as he is concerned, it was not intended to block the initiative of the judge to request the withdrawal of documents from the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence relating to CIA flight.
"This information does not contain any incriminated material or sensitive information," Velvyslanectí explained after a discussion with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed concerns rather than the removal of information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defence, for "clear coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors".
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to deal with this case discreetly between governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, at the occasion of the United States Embassy lunch and Minister of Interior Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, he told the embassy that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and do what they will consider appropriate", he already instructed his collaborators, "to avoid divergent comments with a view to reducing tension".
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the political party Party Popular (PP; Czech People's Party)'s behaviour in this regard.
"In spite of her general pro-american orientation, our experience tells us that the Party Popular will not consider using any hints that Zapater's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the US negotiations that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if this revelation could have negative consequences for the United States government," he notes.
The acknowledged mother-slayer complained on the network on the mother's "old age"
A young woman was talking about a child when she was dead, and she had her blog: "Teror after Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández says "Muki" on the Internet.
with this nickname she used for a long time, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both are from the village of Noia in the area of La Coruño, where a young woman comes from.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman’s emotional life that ABC’s diary reconstructs with the testimony of her family members.
A three-year-old woman from Galicia entered in 1998 with the industrialist Ivan Tunez.
They've been together for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
A man wanted to know if he was his newborn child, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
You recently found a new acquaintance.
Her name was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousam.
Their compounds have lasted for a long time.
Little César lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the boy stayed with her partner, who even invited her to visit Palmy for a week.
However, from the content of her communication, it is clear that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, he's alone at Menorce, and he says, "Alberto's kind of angry that I left for work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes he's got to be with a little girl all day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she's talking about a text message she just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I'm going to send you a child."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving a little girl with my mother, I'll take him when I get back," he says.
in May she talks about her return to her place: "This week I'm going to go there, but I'm only going to 19 because I have to go to work so I don't come to this place."
He explains that if everything goes well, he'll take his son to himself.
"He will be with whom he is to be with, then with me, and he will never again in life, that I would leave him with someone other than my mother," a questionable intention in view of her bad relationship.
There's another contribution here in July.
When this report is released, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island of the first day of this month and was probably murdered 10 is already dead.
"César is satisfied on one side, but not on the other."
"He's on the one hand with me and he likes it pretty much here, but on the other hand he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to go to summer school, and I'm gonna save some money for the herd."

The people would get 4 chairs and PSC in November (Socialist Party of Catalonia - late November) to lose 9 mandates
With the results of November 28, the PP party could have the main word on the councillors in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes obtained and the number of experienced Members during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (Lid side of Catalan - no later) already has an idea of the general elections, whether or not there is an increase, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in the international elections is usually once against the Catalan elections.
in 2008, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes in general, while in the 2006 autonomous elections this number was only 316.222.
Last week she received a PPC (Lid page of Catalan) 384,091 votes.
If this trend of navigation was maintained, which was supported by the transfer of PSC votes and the loyalty of PP voters, the analysts calculated that if the general elections were to take place, the PPC could receive 12 MPs in November against the existing 8th side of CiU (Convergencia and the Union, Czech Shoda and the Union – no later than the date) to also receive 4 mandates (they have 10) and PSC would lose at least 9 seats (they have 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia has a key role to play for the parties PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the people, the ERC party (Levic Republican Party of Catalonia - Mayo) would lose one MP - now has 3 - while the ICV (Mayo Green Initiative for Catalonia) would continue to have one mandate, possibly another one would receive.
However, according to the election calendar, the nearest delivery will take place in May 2011 at the opportunity of the general elections, where people could also have a decisive influence on the end of the Socialist rule in four main provincial cities and also on changes to the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the largest budget management – EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and peoples agree with the possibility that PSC could lose its workers in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists did not receive most and could not turn to their traditional associations, the parties of the ERC and the ICV.
In view of the debate of the Republicans, it would not be possible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona representative - as it is necessary to obtain at least 5% of the votes.
The PP site has increased the number of votes received in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the operation of Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP received only 500 votes more than PSC, whose Mayor Angel Ross has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The people also received other important councillors such as Badalona, Castelldeels, or Reus.
At the present time, the PP is represented at 34 staff members in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell provided Al-Qaida organization thousands of bands
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, three more were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian, who were detained by the General Information Commission agents in Barcelona, formed a jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, which established travel passports to various groups of Al-Qaeda organisations, including "Tygry of the Liberation of Tamil Ilam" or "Lashkar-e-Thaiba", where the second group was the author of the assassinations in Bombay, where 106 people were killed in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to the investigation of this matter, aims to ensure through "operation Kampai" the weakening of Al-Qaida's paramilitary device at international level and "restricting its operational capabilities".
The investigators estimate that during the two years that this cell was active in Catalonia, it could send thousands of travel passports to Thailand, where they were then slaughtered and then delivered to groups that form the criminal galaxy of Al-Qaeda so that their "fighters" could travel across the borders of Europe and other Western countries without trial.
This fragmented cell was not the only active one that had a network of jihad in Europe, and therefore these investigations were also attended by other European police units in addition to Thai services, and it cannot therefore be ruled out that in the following days, there will be no similar attacks in other European countries, as in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigeriac Babatounde Agunbiade) further developed in Thailand, while the Pakistani peoples Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeesan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Siranglaya Kybumrung were captured.
It was these men who drove a cell from Bangkok living in Spain and elsewhere in other European countries.
The Catalan network, the part of which was abolished in 2009, in particular stole tourist travel passports that met Islamic requirements.
This means that the documents must have belonged to men between the ages of 25 and 45 years, had to be valid for several years and without a designated visa.
In the investigation documents it is stressed that there are no facts yet known that would link Catalan with the assassination in Bombay, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be noted that a few days before this assassination, about a thousand dollars were sent from the Catalan translation agency that had been "inserted" for the purchase of tickets to mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command" who killed 106 people.
The police have already had a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) requires Mass to stop the fiscal agreement
The president of the PPC (Lid Party of Catalonia) Alicia Sánchezová-Camach had yesterday the opportunity to personally present to Artur Mass his conditions, for which he is willing to support his introduction to the role of President Generalitat; these conditions are consistent with those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and to reject ventures such as an economic agreement which the leader of the nationalists wishes to propose during his mandate.
The president of the Catalan peoples went to the meeting with Arthur Mass with the certainty of 18 parliamentary seats received in elections last week, which is more than satisfactory for obtaining the form, so the CU candidate needs to hold at least one of the formations of the opposition to vote on his arrival to the office.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on future alliances that nationalists would like to maintain when general elections are held, but so far talks conducted in these days by Mas with the rest of the political leaders are carried by the Catalan spirit.
As regards President PP, in order to receive her support for the introduction of the function, "it will have to end with all the official and free speech", as well as with the economic agreement - similar to that of Basicka - which the CIU leader even wanted to put to the vote in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to stifle the overhauled political apparatus of autonomous administrations and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Mass's introduction to the function will be dealt with under PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised a strong opposition, Joan Herrero (ICV) and today he meets with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Riverou (Ciutadans) and Joan Laportou (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric device ensures that death has not resulted from "a lack of measures"
The presentation of the center of Olot does not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the Geriatric Centre La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to address the damage caused by the criminal behavioral institution Joan Vily Dilmé, a caregiver who, in the meantime, had been employed here, killed at least eleven seniors who were in care.
The director of this house for seniors Joan Sala came along with the lawyer, lawyer Joan Canada, and announced that "the desire of the house La Caritat would have been able to bring charges against the defendant" to the responsible murder, while "the law and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer because it has not in time revealed criminal activities of the caregivers, the great threat to the home of La Caritat now poses requirements for material damages that are already calculated by the legal representatives of the remaining families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime had occurred already in August 2009 and that he had not stopped killing since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of the eight client bodies of the senior home with the suspicion that in many cases no doctor had visited the deceased personally, but, given the age and poor health of the patients, everything had gone off the phone.
La Caritat yesterday, through her director, she resolutely rejected this rigour and stressed that "the lack of action could in no way be the cause of what happened".
The legal representative of La Caritat added that "there is no indication in the case that any third party would be in doubt other than its own accused".
A man named "The Angel of Death" admitted yesterday 11 deaths and explained that the first crime was allowed on 29 August 2009 and that he killed the second elderly man in the month and half later.
in this case, death caused by too high insulin doses, unlike the first time he used a mixture of soothing tablets.
The Director of La Caritat stated that it is complicated to control staff access to medicines.
Insulin and cocktail sedatives were likely in six cases with nine means that this caregiver used to kill patients in an effort to relieve them from suffering.
However, the analysis that is currently being carried out in the laboratory should show whether Vila was less likely and actually sought less cruel death for her first victim or was killed by the use of the lie, as he already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat, they do not believe in a medical claim and do not rule out that the number of people killed may be higher than what they have admitted, and justify their conduct in the various versions that Vila has given to the court with the knowledge that he must change his behavior when it turns out that he killed eight people.
That is why they say that they want justice to be available to clarify the whole scope of this matter.
The European Central Bank is in danger
Yesterday's investors reacted strongly to yesterday's threat from President Trichet's European Central Bank, which pointed out that "markets should not underestimate our ability to respond".
The district differentials closed by force and the European bank's share declined by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to be wrong - the euro has just risen above the critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the non-liquid market, which, although declining, recovers - but thanks to a short and very speculative position.
The investor will take some time before he loses his fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us as saying that it would take the liquidity back today, and tomorrow it will have to be quartered in two years.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the State debt recovery plan for the inefficiency and elimination of all exceptional liquidity levels within a period of one week and for the unrestricted access for a period of one week only.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the level of liquidity to be predicted "minimally in March" and to comply with a three-month bid with an unlimited approach to the end of this quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue in their bond purchase programme and that they will even announce its increase.
If it does not meet the expected result, it will produce a response from yesterday's markets again, and even if they continue to be blind to the level of liquidity, Allah is with us.
It was the same at the conference in May, where they claimed that they were not considering buying bonds, and there was a collapse of markets - tomorrow the story could be repeated.
The European Central Bank must be reliable and durable.
In May, she announced that she had bought many of them on Monday and Wednesday, which led to another collapse of the market.
Yesterday's auction exchange for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro spent only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting a change in the mood on the market to which Trichet's words came.
In Ireland, the figures represent the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
Estimates represent about 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, until February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be settled.
Although Ireland has no credibility after the problem has not been revealed by stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable within the framework of the aid plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, on the next Tuesday, the government will need to get Parliament's approval of the new budget and still lacks sufficient support, so there is still government uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has calmed down her speech to release the tension in the face for the next EU summit held on 14 December, which requires a political compromise to show that we are the Union and we are all on one ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven's Odo to rejoice.
In Spain yesterday, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, reduction of deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to restore employment - to investors' ears it sounds like four years from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock exchange grew by 4.5%, i.e. twice as much as the other European stock exchange.
Unlike February, the government's response and the Spanish National Banks were quick and convincing - we are looking for a surprising effect.
Today we have a key bid for three years, which will benefit from the effect of Trichet, which, we hope, will be a big demand for it, which will help to unravel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Asking for a rescue plan would be for Spain's self-sacrifice.
They would give us the cash we don't need - in El Tesoro there are 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March - high rates and market access would close our son die.
However, we still need to use Cesar's wife's strategy - "not to be it, but to look like it".
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen Group will attack Vega Sicilia's proceedings requested by his children
Boure in an open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, unreal.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will attack after he has taken her as "very insignificant", the legal proceedings of El Enebro scheduled for the 16th of this month and five of his seven descendants, to which they should try to excite themselves and strengthen themselves with the administrative authorities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are bringing together a legal group for a new chapter of their dispute over the governance of the part of the company.
The founder of the largest holding of business services does not seem to be willing to settle in his dispute about membership in the ruling authorities of the El Enebro group.
of its administrative committee, five of its seven descendants, who were appointed to serve as alternates during the meeting of shareholders on 18 January of this year and whose objection is entered in the Trade Register.
The trial of the El Enebro group scheduled for the sixteenth of this month, which was sent to the Trade Court's official No. 2 in Madrid, renewed the riots in the Alvarez family.
The appeal to the judge shall be the only legal means to resolve the dispute, which guarantees that the Commission is convened.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elviry of Álvarez of the Mezquiriz is to consider David Álvarez as "the desperate means of his five children serving with the help of the judiciary and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the dialogue of 18 January, which has been completely ineffective".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal attack of this proceeding as "very insignificant".
The sole protagonists, who discreetly silenced themselves, have already tried without success to call the court in June.
in El Enebro, a group owned by other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls the seven descendants of David Álvarez 100% capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires the right to use 51% of capital.
This matter is a key question that the judge will have to decide when the matter of the judicial attack is being referred. The date of the appeal has not yet been determined.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapon from Siemens
Software proposes improvements in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula 1 series in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed is characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the opportunity of this new incoming team too seriously, and despite a recent upward trend, all of them were the winners of Ferrari Fernanda Alons.
Without wanting to reduce the driving skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of the Renault engine that drives his car, in Formula 1 world, was born a legend - a "secret weapon", which the multinational Siemens put into the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is an efficient software simulating the departures that the German company launched on the market in 2007 for the purpose of very remote car sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in manufacturing races around the world, in energy races and for high precision devices.
Its aim is to reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, avoiding unnecessary errors and spending.
PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon camera, the Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most popular commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens Industrial Division, explains that the use of this software enabled the Red Bull team to perform "over several hours, in almost real time" modifications and improvements, which otherwise occur during the race and test.
Russwurm says that in 1992 there were an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements during one period.
in the Red Bull team today works on 180 highly qualified professionals equipped with efficient information technology, who analyze and propose any type of vehicle modification.
The leader of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull racing vehicles with the exception of the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety components are modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours due to advanced production systems using lasers and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical capacity is the amount of 40 million dollars representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up about 50 km from London's peak technology race to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings that are limited to visitors - especially journalists.
Everything that's going on here is considered a "great secret."
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero Red Bull is no doubt champion Sebastian Vettel in Formula 1.
However, by means of disproportionate technological means, which have put the label of energy drinks into its participation in the race circles, other protagonists, whose help is invaluable, are hidden and nobody knows it.
Chief of Production Technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in the research and development of vehicles contributed to a 50% victory and the rest was the driver's credit.
At present, this ratio has changed and technology stands to be a success of 85%, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will set up its own business in two years in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with his trading partner Pont Reyes yesterday celebrated its first exclusive sale in Barcelona.
This company will be the first of the network of 20 shops ranging from 80 to 100 m2, which this supranational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These shops will also be located in 16 existing shops such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte English.
Spanish Vice-President HP Helena Herrer has set an example of a newly built sale to Barcelona's Gran Vía, a company of Pont Reyes, with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company has come up with a plan to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2013, including 20 Spanish shops.
The first sales were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the trade in Barcelona is the third.
Herrera did not want to explain where further sales would be opened, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrev, who also runs HP's personal systems, has ensured that the philosophy of opening up businesses will still be the same - with the use of local distributors who have experience and knowledge in the sector.
The North American company is here dealing with the exclusive design of sales equipment (with products that can be tested on an interactive basis) that will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also involved in providing personnel for business.
Helena Herrová argued that it would be a franchise, and stressed that the exclusive network sold is intended to "improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises when purchasing, service, family service and even packaging".
Trade in Barcelona is part of the world-wide pilot programme, which aims to solve any problems with computer devices in the guarantee.
Online service is connected to the technical centre of residence in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"Then we will be able to solve in 10 minutes the problems that may otherwise take up to two days."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, given that large companies already have a contract service for technical assistance," said Helen Herrerov yesterday.
Sabadell agrees that he will steal over the next three years to his competitors millions of customers
More optimistic than the other boss, a member of Banco Sabadell's Board, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a demanding year for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
However, it is estimated that interest rates will be reduced, but they will try to compensate for the payment of bank charges and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to be able to obtain a million private customers within three years.
Sabadell has found a way to use the next three years and can survive under difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan with validity for three years in 2011.
The aim, in addition to survival without having to turn to public assistance in the FROB, is to gain market share by attracting millions of new private customers - and 700,000, respectively, if those who leave the bank if necessary - because until now the institution has been moving away from small and medium-sized businesses and large businesses than small customers.
This year, 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies have already been granted a bank.
Its market share is in terms of private customers 3.5%, while corporate customers account for more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or can also be said to be bridging, with a view to reducing the costs that the bank will face when presenting the results for the period.
At this time, a few banking institutions are reluctant to set their goals and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of global banking.
Sabadell this year will close his Optima programme, set four years ago, although originally for three years, but the market situation required expansion for another period.
Customers who leave the fire department will be their main target group.
At the meeting organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "hard and very important".
In fact, it is believed that the journey from the crisis in Spain will be "long".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", which has added a fundamental to the survival of the banking sector.
And although they believe that the passive war - which reduces margins - is declining, the price of the risks that banks and sporadics pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, which compensates for the reduction of margins.
"The theme of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a stress factor for credit".
"We haven't closed the shell yet, but the differentials are very high," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and higher differential prices - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "now is a reduction of commissions", but here is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell's strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as a general rule, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It is not free to ensure that in Spain "greater sizes are required".
"Next year there will be no stone left on the stone," he assured.
It confirms that capital needs are "very low" and does not rule out that some Spanish institutions enter among the red numbers.
And it shows that FROB can market the collection of funds before new capital measures.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it remains a serious problem that some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It means that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to receive short-term funding through repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA excludes another flue-fusion spore
Yesterday, the Director-General of CECA refused that another wave of fusion should be triggered and continued at the speed with which the sector is being reorganised.
When he began the process of merging Spanish spores, there were several institutions that ensured that this first phase was not involved and waited for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation spousal (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta ruled yesterday that a new wave of these operations should occur.
"I believe that most mergers have already been implemented, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Civic group cannot be regarded as a second round, what is happening are contracts."
"Most have been fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already ready and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has worked very well on this issue," the director noted.
In his statements at the meeting of ADEA (Association of Leaders and Executive Officers of Aragon - see above) Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process is being carried out "as quickly as possible and we must be very contented, as shown in the payments that have not now appeared in business plans with the Spanish National Bank", he stressed.
"From 45 partners with average assets of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, thus reducing the number of institutions by 62% to be larger and thus fall in line with the Basel Treaty," he said.
Olavarrieta admitted that "there are a number of not too happy views on the weakness of the process," which show "a lack of seriousness and understanding", because "what the Spanish National Bank does is to remind us that we must be in time before the end of the year."
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta confirmed yesterday that Spain has the most detailed financial system throughout Europe and "probably" in the world, and that those who doubt it have attributed "a lack of knowledge".
The Director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be peaceful" with respect to financial institutions and a system that has managed the "very important" concentration process and continues the "highest speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking was very good from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Stocks and red German line
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but has laid down conditions for the Union as a whole.
The tension on the markets has resulted in two government responses.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed a new adaptation measure, since the reduction of taxes on small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private agencies or the cancellation of 426 euros for unemployed without a fee, until after the privatisation of 49% AENA (Spain airport and air traffic management – no later), the manager of Barajas and El Prat airport and 30% of the state lottery.
With the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, Vice-President Elena Salgadová joined critics at Angely Merkel's office for her responsibility for the resolution of the current crisis.
How to interpret this movement?
It is said above that Merkel's opinion is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future will be, which affects the idea of observing the old traditions that are held by a large part of the other members.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is starting to speculate on three possible routes from the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, part of which would be Germany, but also for example Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the monetary zone.
The second is the return to March - although it may now appear as a Shifi, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option is, according to the German proposals for recasting the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary incentives, incentives for criminal states, possible deferrals of payments for some of them, and by extending possible costs to private sector regulation.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so now there is no space for the draws.
First, in 2009 when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission caused deficits, the German government withdrew its constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a dispute between what Germany considered to be the right (tax incentives and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second showed this Central European country when Merkel painfully reached a decision on Greece's rescue.
It has already been the subject of sharp criticism, but it is true that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which has also been published, were strongly against the salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last few October days, Merkel once again came forward with a clear opinion when she called for the reform of the European Union's conventions in such a way that it would be possible to save a Member State and at the same time make it possible for private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European because it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although in a somewhat reduced form, was approved, and we should follow the Union reform process in the coming months, which should allow these measures from 2013.
The Germans came across a red line that they didn't intend to cross.
And he tells us all that, although it is now necessary to take measures which are obviously too inconsistent, the old functioning of the euro will end from this date.
The year 2013 will represent the birth of a new monetary zone, in which the violating states will be severely punished and may be forced to declare the deferral of payments and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany points out that we need to make a strong path to growth with increased savings and investments, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on demand and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, which governments in the years booming Spanish growth simply do not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
There is no one but to restore the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want for us is much harder.
And the worst part is that under these conditions, we could be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulence will bring greater peace.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities given to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his two statements (reforms promised after meeting with large businesses from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggest that, through criticism of Merkel's address, the way of thinking is to put things in order.
However, the red line that Germany has drawn, it's here, and it doesn't seem to want to move with it.
And from the possibilities that can be considered, leaving the eurozone cannot be ruled out by too many serious countries.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sports and rules
The fines that Alonso and Ramos conducted in the fight with Ajax show that the intention is never to avoid punishment.
It is believed that the ban on two Real Madrid players (Xabi's Alons and Sergia Ramose) in the League of Masters against Ajax on November 23rd caused the sea of ink to be written about whether or not this is non-sport behavior, and whether UEFA should not punish both footballers if possible.
As it is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which had their team clearly won) appointed players one after the other deliberately wasted time at a time when they had to play the game to provoke the judge, and it showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next fight against Auxerre - and Real Madrid will end up in their group in the front - and will be able to move away from the ticket to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary commission sentenced coach José Mourinh to two battles and the provincial players received a cash penalty.
Making a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more common in football.
It's so extended that it's part of the ego football, that is, rules that are not written, but they're following.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that her participant was a team of Real Madrid (which, in its humidly humidity and honor, had already suffered for similar acts of his players), and, as it seems, also thanks to the dramatization led by Maurinh, which thus adds to his long story of the comedian and provocator another episode.
in any case, the debate is about whether this kind of conduct, which is not explicitly prohibited, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether in these circumstances there is a violation of the law; it is indeed about action that respects the rules of sport, which, however, seems to be trying to circumvent.
It is decided what kind of damage such a conversation can do to a sports spirit.
One aspect of sports behavior is the physical impatience of opponents who have not been violated in these cases, or have not been involved in a violent game.
Another of these features that characterize the clean game is to avoid the fact that players have an opponent's benefit team because of their crime - which has not been achieved here either.
So the paradoxical act of the Real Madrid players is that there has not been what we normally characterize as a hunting or law enforcement, there has not been a hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behaviour should be as clear as possible in order to obtain punishment.
They waited, and they loved the punishment.
The next question, however, is how the guilty will benefit from their deliberate transgression.
It is necessary to note here that the opponent is not in a disadvantaged position and that there is no benefit in the current match because the obvious result is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not even a useful strategy for another match since the club won't be able to count with these players.
The advantage is obviously that players will start another phase of the League of Masters without cards that could threaten their participation in the future match.
However, it is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, so the team can be eliminated at first sight, and in addition to this, the players will re-enact the punishment, and they will go to the second round of tickets, in which to be excluded only one card less than in the first round.
So as the wheels continue, it's not quite clear if it's an advantage.
In short and well, these negotiations do not oppose the sport spirit, which is part of a strategic decision that allows maximum benefit under the rules.
In the case we're dealing with here, the players had no intention of avoiding the award of punishment (which would be a clear case of rules), but they chose when to submit to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding or running away from the punishment.
Although there is no clear distinction between the right-wing and the right-wing rules, I believe that in this case it was clearly the right-wing.
It seems to me that controversy arises for two reasons: because it was about two self-exclusions and the way instructions were transmitted to them to provoke them from leadership.
The damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fighting offers for Christmas parties in Barcelona
The Dictate of the calendar concentrates this year's wild reservations on 16 and 17 December.
There is a fast-paced celebration of self-employed people who want to lose between 20 and 30 euros.
As well as Turkish honey or lotteries, with the coming of December, pre-annual parties, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, have failed because of the crisis in the fight to get customers by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to lose 20 to 30 euros for food, they agree with business and associations from this sector.
To complete the complication of the numbers, the calendar this year (when Friday arrived on Friday) concentrated on requests for a week from 13 December, which resulted in a wave of reservations at peaks (16th and 17th), while there was almost no operation in the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the faded years began, there are many companies that cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
To avoid abandoning tradition, many employees pay for their own pocket party losses.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices on the fertility line, the president of the association restaurant Gremi de Resturação de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patronage of the restaurant facilities is not reluctant to predict what will be celebrated this month.
"People will think well of it before they make a reservation."
"They want to go out, but as far as prices are concerned, they're careful," he adds.
Shops will go well with those who offer quality and good service at a favourable price," he says and recalls that due to the crisis, customers tend to go down and most of the customers now want to lose around 25 euros.
The research in various facilities shows that the biggest demand for reservations is on the evening of 17 December.
Soteras Group announces a real boom of reservations this Friday, with most requirements for losses of up to EUR 30, with an increase in the offered menu, the total prices of which range from EUR 25 to EUR 30.
in another significant company, which is Andilana, which includes 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought the specificity of this year's calendar more timely reservations, which has been in place since the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menu, from which everyone should choose, moves from €19.95 to €30," they say.
In the AN Group, including El Mussol, Attic, QuQ and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after they have seen the second half of the increase in profits and have relatively strong prospects for Christmas markets.
The resources of this company stress that the day of 18 December will also be a difficult day, as the Christmas celebrations will be held between friends.
to their six group menus added the Christmas menu, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as compared to last year, guests tend to lose 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish forest wine - no later).
They also noted that companies are already emerging, which call their employees again, and it seems that the size of the groups is something bigger.
Fecasarm Vice President (which includes institutions such as the Bar Association, Restaurant and Leisure Centre in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations is "recovered", although customers "opportunity to maximum".
This notion did not come true during the Christmas celebration, whether it was paid or indicated.
Pakistan's nuclear program has caused a major unrest in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster speed than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the United States embassy in Pakistan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published by the Wikileaks portal, confirms the extraordinary unrest that sparks the Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
In addition to the explanatory and important details that they offer regarding the content of communication and the thinking of North American diplomats in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states, with regard to nuclear security, instead of increasing, "is on the move", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The speciality of Pakistan's nuclear programme - that its weapons are not disarmed, but according to parts to facilitate their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of Washington's main causes of anxiety.
This is calculated by the embassy in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and with the programme of controlled shots is not only observed in the United States, but also in Russia, as a growing and promising reason to be alert.
"Pakistan had to hire personnel with a strong religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in education and culture, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or controlled fire programmes," said an expert from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with their opponents from the United States.
The latest documentation published by Julian Assange's server is further lower cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on the expansion of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
Depeše issued by the Embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", claims: "Transparence often does not exist; aid offers remain unresponsible or are rejected".
in another report, Peter Lavoy, a national news service worker for South Asia, states that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world."
Major Petterson also asks Washington to "explain very well" during the visit of General Ashfânio's chief army, that "the Pakistani army must end with silent support to terrorist groups".
She's in charge of Wikileaks.
Obama appoints a high-level employee responsible for combating terrorism to avoid new leaks of information.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" to track and determine where Assange might be.
All about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth, where it's hard to be sure of facts.
Interpol announced yesterday a "extraordinary challenge", so-called regular notice, to "localization and monitoring of the movement" of Assange.
However, it is not a classic order for detention.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but it dates to November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the last escape of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with charges of sexual abuse facing Australia in Sweden.
In addition, the legal representative of author Wikileaks Mark Stephens assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assangem".
It was November 20th when the international police council, based in French Lyon, issued this order at the request of Sweden, did not publish it until yesterday, when he received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions for the identification or location of Assange "to implode and release it".
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of persons concerned by the red call, many Member States, as explained by the organisation, consider the so-called regular notices to be a possible arrest - this must be ensured by the national police force - especially in the case of Member States having a bilateral agreement on the issue of detainees, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange should probably be found.
This step was aggravated by Assenge's lawyers, who published the writings yesterday, where they declare that a nine-year-old founder, Wikileaks, was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities through videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared with the legendary Lavrenti Pavlovic Berij, the head of Stalin’s security.
"This is a hero and not a legal prosecution," the letter says.
While the whole world is looking for her - and his mother from Australia is fighting her son's innocence - Assange is still in an unknown place, of course not.
on Monday, he provided Skype with the unknown interview editor of Time magazine - in this interview he requested from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for the US diplomats' order to carry out espionage in the United Nations and violate such international conventions that the United States signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by the White House press spokesman Robert Gibbs, who qualified for a demise as "Laughter and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should be concerned about the opinion of an individual operating the website," he told CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a high-ranking worker responsible for combating terrorism, Rusella Traverse, to prevent further leaks of documents.
Speaker Barack Obama's intention to stop adding Assange to the importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who has been chairing the Committee on National Security since January in the Lower Chamber, asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to examine the possibility of including Wikileaks among the terrorist organization, "in order to be able to touch and reach anyone who has contributed financially to them or otherwise to provide assistance".
Tom Flanagan, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's adviser, went further and declared that Assange should be "killed", which he subsequently had to withdraw.
"Both of them should write a reward or use a plane without flying or something."
Whoever didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist priest, the former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for president.
"Whoever will be in the government, the person responsible for the failure of information, has allowed betrayal and any punishment other than correction would be too modest," said Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for "swimming" in the ERC on the Carod tab
The Republican leader will allow the parties to vote in secret on his resignation.
Huguet proposes more plural execution and the end of the conference system.
Joan Puigcercós has apparently found a recipe to fight a number of internal revolutions already in the ranks of the ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalonia - late November), unparalleled by the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The president is aware that his demise gesture seems to be insufficient to the proponents of former leader Josep Lluíse Caroda-Roviry, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weak as his own leader, and that he cannot absolutely care about other missing flows.
That is why Leader Levice will try to get new criticisms by marking, which will help him to turn to general elections.
First of all, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee would be able to speak in secret to his resignation.
I'm using voting cards, not raising my hands.
If they wish to pass a criminal vote to the President, they will be able to do so without fear of legal action.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the diversion and details of his person.
In several talks, he argued that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one additional, but added, without clarifying the percentage, that he would also not be a good result "by Bulgarian".
Carod's supporters demand more from the president than to make their function available - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, since Puigcercós has the highest authority at the meetings.
But given that they do not have enough to induce demise, they will try to remind the executive of the plan from now until May.
That is why they expect to participate in the preparation of a document on strategic reorientation, on which the National Council will vote on 18 days a month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercóse in exchange for this promise of moving the convention already in autumn 2011.
The leader of the ERC declared that "majority" is damaging stability and that his goal is to enable the organization to once and for all be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context, it seems to be a remarkable article that the current advisor Joseph Huguet signed on his blog.
After considering Puigcercós' ideologist, this innovation consultant took the matter to the fore, that the leader would be confirmed "for several purposes".
And he named them five by two.
The first is the "recomposition" of the executive to represent at least 90% of the members, which means also to include new faces that are from the Carod sector.
The second goal can be a big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC complete the meeting as a mechanism of operation.
And so he fights for state reform so that it is possible to hold congresses through delegates elected by the vote.
The end of the model of the contract system, with the exception of the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction at two last meetings.
However, the 2008 Croatian Assembly decided that the meeting should be considered at a special congress on state reform.
This matter is still unresolved because the situation within the party has reflected on the solution to this matter.
Now, without emerging critical sectors, it might be appropriate for a moment to deal with this matter again and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in November; 390 in 2010
According to the MILENIO journal, Mexico had a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were killed in Mexico, about four less than in the previous month, as reported by the MILENIO newspaper.
Between the murders, there are three cases of women and a few separate bodies found in Mexico City.
in the last month of the year, there are 390 deaths in Mexico, probably linked to organised crime.
Among the cases is the discovery of dead bodies in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the Toluca period.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, next to the injury from mercy to his head and had his hands and legs tied with a rope.
The next day, a body was found in the trunk, which was stored in the storage space of a vehicle over the street of Mixtecas, in the Santa Cruz Acatlán colony, in the Naukalpan period.
Early in the morning on Thursday, 4 November, the body of the non-responsible signs of torture and at least three lethal shots into the chest at the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the section of the Villa Guerrero period.
Next to the body was a report signed by probably a criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, in Nezaalcoyotl, a 50-year-old man was killed by eight shots after leaving his home and wanted to start collecting the waste.
On November 7, two victims were killed at the age of 30 in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony, in the Ecatepec period.
in Chalco was found on a remote road in the colony of El Naranjo the body of a man shot in the forehead, and was found under the body with weapons of calibre 25.
in Ecatepec were found part of the human body in the waste water canal in the colony Playa Golondrin.
The saved ingredients did a thorough search of other parts of it, but they did not find them.
The inhabitants of Tepotzotlán reported the discovery of the body with their hands tied back and wrapped head in the place of Pena Colorado.
A man had a gun wound on his back.
In half a month, the murder of two men who were packed in the bedroom and left in the storage space of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the Atizapán de Zaragoza period was reported, and reports of the death threat were also found in the victim.
The day later was found in the colony of Valle de los Reyes in the period Los Reyes La Paz carton containing the human head.
In the nearby colony, the body was found, packed in a black plastic bag, reported by El Incorrigible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in a bed linen in the Zoquiapan plant during the period of Ixtapaluca, and the second morning in Huixquilucan was found dead man packed in a yellow-modern desert, which was previously reported by the killers left at his body identified as Mario Ríos.
In Ixtapaluca there was a woman found in the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla without a sign of life with two wounds to the tomb.
On the skin of the woman was revealed the tattoo of the sacred character of Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death" - later on) and also the necklaces with her likeness.
At the end of the month, a man with at least three gunshot wounds and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the village of Zinacantepec in the car.
Two days later, two men were found with their head wrapped in tape and a report was also found in them, in the town of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The victim's report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations in which it said, "This will happen to those who don't fit."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found that bore marks after torture and had tied ends, inside the abandoned taxi behind the Centre of Justice in the colony of San Agustín.
The last day of the month two men were found in Los Reyes La Paz and Nezaalcoyotl.
The first one was found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and was packed into black plastic bags, bound with tape and had a long message with it; while the second one was tired and found in the plastic packaging in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Together with him, the agents found a note with the report.
China maintains its objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of this country at the UN Conference on Climate Change COP16 has ensured that its country has made an extraordinary effort to reduce carbon footprints and has clarified that it is on its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will fulfil its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45% in 2020, Su Wei, the representative of this country at the UN Conference on Climate Change.
In its first public speech at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei ensured that his country had made an unscrupulous effort to reduce carbon footprint and change its industry.
He said his country had already invested $245 million over the last four years in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he noted that China will not change its goals and will continue to work with the international community on this issue.
He referred that the Chinese strategy on climate change was divided into four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all of these points, progress has already been noted, including the last approval of a new energy law, which includes the proposed targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction, explained.
He further stressed that in China the federal authorities cooperated with provincial and local authorities in order to achieve their objectives in terms of energy savings, energy efficiency and emission reductions.
Furthermore, as he said, various plans have already been completed, which are financed by both the Chinese Government and the governments of other countries.
For example, it is reported that the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been introduced over the last five years, has received investments from the United Nations, the government and private initiatives.
The provincial project of climate change is also underway, further the project of exchange of lightning for spare lamps and the project of mitigation and adaptation, has clarified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the expert adviser of this country for climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than they generally thought.
For example, he cured, greenhouse gas emissions per capita are 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also developed unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, it has increased 20% energy efficiency over the last five years and expects further progress to be made by 2020.
Encouraging Espina: César Nava
The President of the PAN party (Partido Action Nacional, Czech National Action Party - No.) stated that the former President of this party is entitled to apply to the National Order Commission of its own law.
The President of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, has ensured that the exclusion of Manuel Espiny Barrientose has been legalized and that the former President of this party is entitled to refer to the National Order Commission and to claim his rights.
In the debate which was held before the opposition by the Governor of Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espina is, in any case, a decision taken at the local level.
"It is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino shall have the right to refer to him in his case through a complaint to the Commission of the National Council in order to deal with a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that there is no time to think about 2012 and that it has never been at the negotiating table on the presidential candidacy of the alliance.
Nava Vazquez expressed his conviction that the PAN would come out of the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor would be elected, was sent.
"This (the alliance in 2012) is a theme that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, it was the intention for local elections, which was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The president of the PAN said that his side is 71 years of dialogue, and therefore he added, "It does not relieve us of internal competition, rather it is seeking and strengthening us".
He said that the committee would be able to elect the best president or president without debate, which it deserves for the next three years of the PAN, so it would send the staff to "who the committee decides".
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, any one of these five with pride I shall hand over to the Bureau of the Chairman of the Party."
He predicted that the rise, which the party recorded in the last elections in July, would be reflected in future clans, although "not yet time to think about 2012".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabina Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, which have roots in alliances in Oaxace, Pueble and Sinaloe, will represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, as "many expectations and complaints are inserted into them, and I am sure Gabino is worth this expectation".
When we asked her about the criticisms of President Felipe Calderón by PRI (Partido Revolutionaryario Institutional, Czech Republic's Revolutionary Institutional Party, p.m.) due to his four-year speeches, which he ruled, César Nava called upon members of PRI to reflect on the sixties of former presidents Ernest Zedilla and Carlos Salinase de Gortari.
"If in PRI they believe that the governments of Zedilla and Salinase were better than the rule of Fox and Claderon, then they will begin to defend them, so they will leave their streets," he confessed.
He said that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during the national auditorium, since there is no use in this country of clothing or censorship.
Obama promotes on Twitter the law to support undocumented students
"If you think that the adoption of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and have to approve this law," the American president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today, with a contribution to his personal social network account Twitter, added to national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents.
"If you think that the adoption of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and have to approve this law," Obama tweeted.
His brief report points to an Internet link to a more comprehensive document, which calls for the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on this law is getting closer.
"Since the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion sound," she points out.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators were threatened by blocking the approval of any law unless the extension of the Bush era tax reduction and government financing were approved.
Such blocking, as notified by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as ratification of a new agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the President-in-Office expressed his belief that as soon as a fiscal topic is resolved, it would be possible to draw up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still time left..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that we will be able to reach agreements in this matter at some point and then be able to plan a series of other matters," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would request a "conclusion vote" on the Dream Act, so that the proposal to legalize students without evidence could be voted in the Senate since the next Thursday, although more likely next week.
The Senate's approval of the Dream Act or the "American Dream" law would legalise about 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States 16 years before the end of the year, lived in the country for the last five years and were admitted to the institution of higher education or the army.
However, the honourable Member needs to approve a proposal of 60 votes, which is why a number of Republicans need assistance, so its legislators' organisations are making intensive efforts to ensure the approval of this law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebrasky, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of India, expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, the members of the Dream Act need to obtain a number of Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators, with whom the majority are negotiating, are senators from Maine Olympia Snowwe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing senator from Florida George Lemieux, who has supplemented Senator Mel Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but they have told you that they will not support her any more.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet expressed himself.
Although Sweden's representatives are attracted to another version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
with the literature insert the finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la la la la la la la la laga", translated "insert the finger into the wound" is the period of the Czech "breath on the head - later).
The second round of the cycle The joy of language was a change where participants presented a literary gala presentation
"I understand this in the language, but... the finger to the wound? What do I expect from me?" asked author Luis Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round Exhilaration from the language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used during this occasion as a subtitle (on another fair at the cool table was dedicated to the theme of Sex in the language, explained).
The finger to the wound "brings us to the narrow ones", the most popular Argentinian writer to the audience, composed mostly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to hear this debate at the cool table, moderated by Marisol Schultz and attended by Valenzuel, Sergia Ramírez, Mayry Monterov and Luis Garcia Monter.
Luisa Valenzuela read the text that she gave to Gonzal Celori, and which Schultz later named as a great story, in which Luis first appeared as a protagonist who, when looking for the knowledge of what the "earning" is, goes from a doctor to a doctor from which she does not get the answer, although the point of the same story is true.
From an infector, he goes on to say, "Persistence isn't my strong side, maybe it's my wound."
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the morning is not a scientific term, it's a psychoanalyst that reveals the secret: "The morning is a real mess and thus symbolic is a scar".
The protagonist woke up slowly and concluded that "on the morning she was able to find out only so much that she is really confused and does not exist", but was convinced that the joys and insults in the language must go hand in hand.
The writer of Valenzuel was playing with both of them.
Nikarageujec Sergio Ramírez also made a delightful statement, which he called the Praise of the Invention, in which the finger is not named in the morning, but will appear at one point.
with the elements of magical realism, they tell about the famous wizard who played the dark, brought back people who went far away, or repaired the honesty that one lady lost, this statement that then turned to speak America, a great novel in which his own chroniclers who told it had not been missing from the beginning, and here is quoted as Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticises the overcrowding in the execution of the captors.
"Cervantes, who invented us all, laughed at the finged testimony that was presented in the stories as real, but in another way never managed to tell the story of America with such imaginations that even lost the stad."
However, he stressed that "they are fools and liars who have greater imagination" and that is where the reality and the lie, where they no longer know what the story belongs to one group and what the other achieves, the fictitious literature of their summit.
It's actually called a "cervanto tradition."
"Thanks to his link, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter stressed and praised the variety of interpretations that enabled the International Book Fair to be called by its words.
The Cuban-Portugal writer showed her finger on the big wound of social violence that is passing through her country - and shares it with Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs close a quiet compromise that is of course not intended," she said after stating that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that arises between the author and readers - and in their "chemical reaction".
The evening closed by Spanish poet Luis Garcia Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger to the wound of the writer bound by the writer".
He said that in the world that lives in haste, as well as in intellectual growth and control of consciousness that transcends dogmatism, it is forgotten that "there is a small one behind every attraction and there is also a small one behind every denial."
"To be lords of our thoughts and realities we have to color: and coloring means many times putting a finger in the wound and bothering those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, blacks, fixed ideas and without coloring, and also bothering the authorities who prefer this black world," he said to support the meaning of writing.
Romano follows his first title
Rubén Omar Romano is reading three defeats in the finals, during his career he has experienced good and bad, but he has already managed to reach on three occasions in a decisive series.
In duele Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the finals, there are also two different styles that highlight their techniques, teams that have a marked difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano is reading three defeats in the finals, during his career he has experienced good and bad, but he has managed to reach already on three occasions on the decision-making series, but he has gone to the present time with unresolved, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentinian must have been satisfied with the silver medal, remained a step behind the victory and curiously played with the same team following the finals.
The Sanistic strategy as a coach reached its first final in the Apertura tournament in 2002, when he had a problem with the club Morelia, with which he had a total of 4-2 against Toluce; then, in the 2003 Clousura tournament, he went back to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
With the Santos Laguna Club in Tournament Torneo Bicentenario 2010, against the "rabies" from Toluka, Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against "Uzenařům" (the next name of the Club Deportivo Toluca - late November) after 210 minutes of the game indiscriminately 2-2, after a series of criminal shootings he got to the advantage of three on one and had two opportunities to secure a title, but at last his three players passed from 11 steps and so suffered the turn to 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against "Red Devils" from Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and so he could first celebrate the title, although he says he is the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to get statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I'm bound to, and the title would of course be for me, but the first is the most important," said the coach, when asked about the number that speaks against him in the finals.
in the living memory of his previous finals, in which, as he confirms, he has learned a lot, "we have been taught that until the end of the decision-making process, we cannot celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as the players, because the past with the two penalties, we were ready to go out to celebrate, and I think we have learned in this, until the game is over, we cannot celebrate".
She is not concerned that this series could be decided in criminal shootings, she believes to its players: "You never try to get to a series of criminal heaps, you try to end in normal time, but sometimes there is no other way and it is necessary to be prepared for this, we were prepared in the last tournament, unfortunately, but fate caught us by the bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, it left us in our hands and we hope that this time it will not come to something like this."
Romano has a chance to stop being the second and to taste the first glory that titles bring.
The United States shall amend the rules for the provision of visas
People will have to turn to the Visa Applicants Service Centre before the Consular Division calls; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011, the visa negotiation process will change to the United States and consulates Velvyslantecje.
A new procedure will require the majority of applicants to turn to the Visa Applicants Centre (Shortly from the ASC) before the Consular Division.
The ASC staff shall receive biometric information from the applicant and they shall be assessed by the consular department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total visa costs will be lower, no longer necessary to pay the meeting fee, the other to process the application and the other to provide the transport service document.
The applicant shall pay only one fee covering all three services.
The current tariff will not be changed: the amount corresponding to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for a visa application (including a visa for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to complete the interview with the consular officer, but only turn to the nearest ASC where they will submit their documents and receive fingerprints.
In view of the fact that biometric information will be collected in ASC, applicants who will request a second meeting with the Consular Division will spend a shorter time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who will apply for a visa on consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra fee of $26.

NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. Space Agency called for a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could lead to corruption in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock expert on astrobiology, a science that deals with the study of origin, evolution, expansion and the future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited the reporters, NASA made sure she was "a discovery that causes a crime in the search for extraterrestrial life", which triggered speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in uninhabited conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and who might be the possibility of becoming intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live are improved.
It is thought to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Lake Mono in the Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life because the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creation of arsenic uses for its life in some way, and that's exactly what its ability increases the likelihood that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proved that "there is another, second form of life, different from what we know".
The Space Agency will announce the actual discovery of tomorrow's press conference.
The conference is attended by the geobiologist Pamela Conradová, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who is studying Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the prospect that his chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergence and Pattern are producing opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Law on Congress lead to the coming of "bipartism", they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period has not yet begun when an opposition block was created at Congress, led by the MPs of the PRD (Partido de la Revolution Democratica, Czech "Democratic Revolution"), PT (Partido del Labor, Czech "Stra work" - Czech Republic), Convergence (Czech "Shoda" later) and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalve, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" in November.
Before the beginning of the session at the beginning of the 60th parliamentary period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patron Montalvo "silver" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, since it is being deleted.
This reform, repeated, begins "bapartism", because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will rule Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarito Santos Aquilar, the PRD's coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Brit by PAN (Partido Action, Czech "National Action Party") and Luis Cárdenas Fonsecou as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms are institutionally creating political marginality from the edge of the PRI (Partido Revolutionario Institutional, Czech "Revolutionian Institutional Party") and PAN.
He clarified that during the following days they will speak to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not, they will again be detailed by those two parties, which ended up with opposition coalitions.
"When I came here (opposite coalitions), I look at it because we're cut off from any decision, even they don't even want to consider the opinions of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence stated that they are in agreement with PRD, PT and Patron, and that is why they will form a plurality group.
It is not possible to allow, he continued that Congress after being monopolized, was now "double".
Aspiring reform of the law is not that there is endless bipartism in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT explained that the Congress at present became "beneficial" two - in violation of PAN and PRI.
"Only one party once ruled it, today it's divided by two."
Mr Montalvo asked that she respect the Member's personality to be given a seat at the action table.
"In order for the five of us Members, who are probably to be nine, but right now they see us as five, we do not remain outside the agreed agreements, each of us in another group, to find a place at the action table, because the problem is that in the reform they have created and voted against, we stand outside, and we do not agree with this reform."
Another 200 thousand pesos for "adder"
Workshops in Mazatlán will pay another check discussed owners of the company supplying electrical equipment.
Another check for something more than 200 thousand pesos was sent to the consultants by Loreno Guadalupe Camach Paluzelos.
This is the amount paid in this second half by the owner of the company supplying electrical equipment to the amount of 1.20,000 pesos.
According to the advice's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November of this year, it was exposed to 200,144,56 pesos and as its subject was mentioned as "the balance of unpaid payments".
The depositary Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that this supplier, who was monitored by the Chief State Audit Office for sales at high prices, would be paid further.
What was not said is the total amount that the workers still owe her, and how many more cheques will be sent in favour of the Camach Palace.
"There was nothing bought now, only what we owed her, as well as other suppliers," he said in one interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24th, October 15th, October 19th, October 29th and November 16th.
Although this company has not yet been published in the Government's letter, as the law provides in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office, in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the depositary has ensured that the services of the contractors have not been used again.
earlier, after 25 July, Noroest published a review of the cheques presented to his suppliers, which revealed that in the period from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year period of the old age of Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camachá Paluzelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 cheques.
This also carried out a transaction with Jumapam, where she was tracking checks on more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about an accident by a foreign tourist because of the bad state of the Sáncheze Taboady text in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist to the depths of Sanchez Taboady, the tourist sector in Mazatlán is asking the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in bad shape and do not show such a port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Zone of the Council, recalled that they repeatedly asked for care for the perception of the destination, and the wrong things the tourists here find to replace with new activities or routes.
He noted that the bad condition of the streets and pedestrians affects tourists who pass through here and see disorder, which adversely affects close businesses.
"Policies don't know what it's like to close a business for one day, and they have no idea about the markets they're avoiding, otherwise these issues would not be solved for so long without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused the lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the council.
"The Council will have to take responsibility and prevent this from happening again, it will have to devote itself to preventive maintenance, not only to correct existing problems," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, we should be maintaining it, but also as residents we deserve clean housing, the workers should change their city maintenance strategy."
There are other places that seem to be neglected and poor, he noted, such as the Masatlán Emblém and El Venadito (monument, socha jelena - no later).
"Today, in order for tourists to arrive, it is not just a promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city that enjoys the purity of its beaches and streets, where the constant maintenance of tourist attractions is being carried out," he said.
"There was no need for attention here, and these facts emphasize something that is well-known, maintenance is missing.
He talked about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the Council, said that priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has a tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, a sub-secretary of the Tourist Promotion, said that saving tourist sites in Mazatlán is indispensable because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and space, but it will need to be put in order first to attract these places and to bring them into the list we have to promote this destination."
IP requests for Congress results
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, would like the Members to take on a great responsibility by setting an example in finding a better Sinaloy, in the various challenges he faces.
The parliamentary term of office and without agreement between the parties and the State Executive requires the business sector in Mazatlán, as Sinaloa is faced with major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI Members, 13 of the PAN, three of the Party Nueva Alliance, two of the PRD, one of the PTs, one of the Convergence and the last of the PVEMs, has been launched, comprising a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations of the new members of the Congress is to enable them to carry out proper leadership, commitments to the company and to the various areas requiring responsible legislative work, and not to be repeated by the same side and the Patriotic pattern.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), proposed that the 40 newly elected members of Congress take on a great responsibility and serve as an example on the road to a better Sinaloa in the various challenges he faces.
"We expect Members to actually exercise their right, without agreement between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become the driving forces of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He therefore spoke of the need to confirm the obligation to establish the necessary overlap that would move the ruling forward by order.
"We want them to do a decent job, and they were primarily committed to companies and sectors, because they were the people of Sinaloa, who gave them their voice in the past elections of confidence."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas hotel association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives would be to gather all the forces in an effort to achieve economic growth in the country, because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important is to encourage economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will support the creation of jobs in a certain way."
With regard to travel, he asked for new legislators to give him greater weight in the public budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is the Ministry with the second lowest budget, which is inappropriate because it is an important economic activity, bringing the currencies and investments that are also directly competing with agriculture."
In addition to spending funds on start-up tourism projects, Congress should help add the state to security and help with the alcohol law that failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
Looking for Three Kings
Girls, cars and motorcycles are together with other players on the wish list of children in the family of Coronadovy Valenzuel.
For their parents, it will be difficult for the three kings to fulfill their ideas about the coming festival, since their home is read by just 12 people and one bereavement.
But Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kašpar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them toys and clothes that they so long for.
The family lives in a modest settlement in the municipality of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as the father has no permanent job.
"Sometimes it's hard because your husband's not lucky, but we're selling mandarins and potatoes...
The four-year-old Adelaida wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like Miss Barbie.
As for ten-year-old José Alfred, he'd want some time of a "monster" car, and for his eight-month-old brother, Jesús, Cayeta would like to dress in size for one year.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I wish I had this monster car', but I told him 'we'll see his son', because it was very expensive," recalls Cayettean's sadness.
For older children who were just in school, it would be perfect clothes and shoes.
Maria Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, has a size of 12, ten-year-old Isaiah size 10, where eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan misses tennis, so he'd have a couple of sizes five and a half or six.
If you want to help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Coronad Valley family, you can participate in the campaign "See the Three Kings", and at the reception of the journal Noroest bring a gift or money in cash.
14 suspected drug dealers who were arrested
Ten visits were carried out in Austria, on Wednesday, during the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of the Indian rope.
Fourteen people were arrested and faced with various charges.
The visits took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that served to produce drugs.
"Approximately 750 pieces of Indian rope, four kilograms of hash, money and equipment that served to produce was fun," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec-speaking police officer.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, both of whom were considered to be the bosses of the entire network, two men from Sherbrook.
The detainees had to go to the courthouse in Sherbrooke as soon as they were arrested.
They could face charges against the production of an Indian rope, its holding with a view to dealing with it, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These visits were carried out following a long-term investigation, which lasted for almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to join these arrests," M. Ruel said.
This police operation took part in 70 regional police officers investigating the city of Estrie State Police Quebec, State Police in Sherbrook and the Police Administration of Sherbrook Memphrémagog.
Illicit migration will be able to continue without problems.
The proposal of the law of conservatives, which, according to the government, should regulate the problem of ships loaded by illegal immigrants, will be clearly overcome while all three opposition parties on Wednesday announced that they could not support it.
"I strongly support the Charter."
"I'm standing right on the side of the party that built a brick under your feet," said the head of the Liberals Michael Ignatieff, a surrounded MP after a weekly meeting of the weekly du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, a law that would allow any person from a ship identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants to retain the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom within one year.
Chief of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he could not support the bill because he was pointing to the wrong goal.
"We're against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we'll see what the government is doing," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD critic in the question of immigration issues, Olivia Chow, rejected the critics who wanted her party not to be strong enough when it came to illegal immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrat agrees with the adoption of measures against illegal immigrants, and that is what we consider to be a portable part of another bill, C-35," Mrs Chow said.
"We do not support the proposal for a Conservative law because it clears guilt on refugees and places children in prison for at least one year," explained Mrs. Chow.
The immigration minister Jason Kenny accused the opposition.
"The Canadians collectively tell Members not to tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada into a man and deal with it as a pathologist."
They expect Canada to take decisive action, Minister Kenny responded.
The government did not vote in confidence with its bill, which could lead the country to the elections leading to its rejection.
One Conservative said to the QMI Agency that the government would request a vote so that any MP who objected would respond from his position in front of his electors.
New unit does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement that it is possible to establish a permanent unit for the fight against corruption and coliseum, many observers are still calling for the establishment of a public investigation commission for the problem.
Minister of Public Security Robert Dutil has been trying to keep this idea from being forgotten: Quebec intends to consult the Department of Research in New York in January next year.
Metropolis has a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement of one of us surprised us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Police Service Council in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, it was not necessary for the public security critic, the party of PQ Stéphane Bergeron, to consider this announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of the hat" and "an amateur solution crushed on the knee".
Minister Dutil himself answered those who fear that political power has too much influence on the future of the unit.
"He's satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Réjean Parenta, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness's hearing in public transfer.
"In addition, Mr Charest insists that he does not want to set up this committee of inquiry, and people think, like you and me, that he's hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of a committee of inquiry is by demise Jean Charesta," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and politics in the Institute for the Education of High Officials.
In order to get out of this blind alley, he proposed to Quebec to give special powers to the Inspector General so that he could investigate coliseum and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the Inspector General," he decided.
It also thinks that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the Commissioners who allow people to bring them to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the records of Charest's government.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Criminal Law, so that it would be better adapted for this type of criminal activity.
This requirement would come from the power for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), which informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marca Fournier that the case law in this kind of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his fellow judge, Rob Nicholson, is just dealing with some of the amendments associated with this letter.
In the 2001 operation of Jaro, which hit the group of bikers, although the Criminal Lawyer has not yet been corrected, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently had to make changes to the Law on Gangstery.
Rivers under strict surveillance.
Several water flows have been under strict control due to strong rainfalls that have fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius, there was a dry land.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
The evening came for another earthquake in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's jammed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, a number of regions were hit by a severe hit, i.e. 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 further millimeters were not expected from today to Thursday evening, depending on the regions.
The effects on the north of the river and the valley of Outauais were most affected.
It could be up to 100 millimeters down there.
If we count these droplets with the shade of snow gathered in some sectors, we can be afraid of flooding in some watercourses.
The Quebec Rescue Service announced on Wednesday night a warning against the danger of floodwaters for the Ouereau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in Les Laurentides, and in Chene, in Lotbinière, became the subject of flood preparedness and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudière, strong dropouts of some lakes, in Sainte-Julianne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the result of the strong rains was that one of the bridges was struck.
Two residences had to be preventively evacuated.
In the Outaouais, some of the lakes of the coast caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service has emergency and is monitoring the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Water Forecast Centre issued on Wednesday warnings against strong floods for several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially slandered
Quebecan broadcaster Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Broadcasting and Television Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements concerning social assistance and the Haitians and, as well as a rough statement during the broadcast.
The Council for Broadcasting and Television judges that Mr Dupont and his group from CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some sentences contained "inaccurate information on social assistance and inaccurate negative exclusion of the Haitians from a rough statement that does not correspond to the broadcast during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussion on suicide, including the transmission of the names of the two persons who took their lives, did not violate the rules for the sending of the public.
The Broadcasting and Television Council received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was taken following the complaint by the Joint Front of the beneficiaries of the social support of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts indicated in the submission were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not misleading.
As for suicide, moderater Stéphane Dupont believed that suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the report was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to the problems of daily life.
"Most of the Commission believes that the controversial episodes of "Dupont's Southern News" have affected a delicate subject in an uncivil and appropriate manner."
There was no cure for him.
The last dispute concerned a declaration following the earthquake in Haiti.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort went to a media shooter that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator said he didn't send any gifts to help the Haitians, because we can't know for sure that they're really gonna get the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates inaccurately negative image of the Haitians.
"I've already opened my class deposit of that thing."
"My list has been intact for one and a half years," the moderator said.
In all the decisions the Commission refuses to use in sending a rough statement.
In any event, the CHOI-FM broadcasts cooperated "on the basis of their responsibilities".
For a station which will have to notify, inter alia, this decision once during the main transmission within three days, the results are minimal.
King of the Kung-fuva Montreal.
The inhabitants of Montreal, from Algeria, Nacereddine Earthmal, have an extremely special time.
The athlete who wins in the "sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), enters the kickbox and the Thai box and searches for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Earthmal, who has been living in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for matches a little everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appears in battle sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and a helper to UPS, just gave his competitors bad news when he won two gold medals at the World Championship at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23rd to 30th October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I've won the categories of kickbox full contact and Thai box, I've given."
"I am currently preparing for China at the World Cup in San Show."
"Friends who finished the first four on the last world championship in every category were invited."
"In Toronto in 2009 I won the bronze."
"In 2005, I finished eight in Vietnam."
"In 2007 in China I finished the tournament in the fifth morning, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished the third, added."
"It's interesting that I've made some progress in every competition."
"I'm going to be at this pace the first year or so!"
"san show" or "sand" is a discipline from China, where the punches of the feet and feet, as well as the ground cast, are allowed.
The matches are traditionally played on the platform and more often in the ring.
The most famous boxer, born of this form of battle, is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well-known in the world of martial arts.
No matter what Nacer Earthmal has to keep in his career only one result, he will courageously confirm his participation in the super tournament "King of Sanda", Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains a nice guy."
"It's a little equivalent for the Stade Lumpinee (highest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Earthmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before he suffered loss in the finals.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, analyzed."
"There are four rivals per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"The winners' semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners win every category so that the only champion, King kung fu, can be crowned."
450 million contracted without public competition
Hydro-Québec agreed after an agreement of 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the heart of this album, more than 100 contracts are the consortium created by BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor, which received the most important contract, a total of $295 million without public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of Energie Gérance, was complemented in 2004 in conjunction with the choice of Hydro-Québec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector to manage this significant hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Energie gérance" consortium was awarded a lucrative contract without any notice of public competition.
For the Quebec side, the complaint to the consortium of companies in front of us poses a serious ethical problem that risks exclusion of competition and triggers price increases.
"It's a new way to realize colleges and eliminate competition."
"This means that people, the side agreements are no longer secret, they are already open today," said PQ Sylvain Simard yesterday at a press conference.
About something earlier, in the morning, Mr. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he said that it was difficult to carry how the public interest could be so sold.
The Ministry of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, in the afternoon, refused to object to this contract for coliseum.
"I have my own way," she roared and claimed that the PQ was "undeserved" and "lost accuracy."
She said "it would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for the creation of a consortium is common practice throughout the world.
It is usually an alliance limited in time that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise to respond to the call for proposals for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the scope of the work.
The construction is already in progress and must be deployed by 2012.
However, the contract was admitted without competition; it was a trade.
It must also be acknowledged that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, nor in relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir discovered last week, the form of the consortium in the field of engineering advice is the subject of government investigation.
If we fly over the Quebec companies' trade register at speed, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been created.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; name it CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and they're tens, leads to one and the same legal person, and that's Dessau.
With regard to the consortium Eénergie gérance, Minister Normandeau has in particular stressed the fact that "the territory of La Baie James is typical of the special dynamics of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has responded to it since the 1970s".
The project’s main patron, Eastmain, Réal Laporte, from the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), provided an explanation which led us to take the lead in the fact that the project management contract was concluded after an agreement.
"If you go to public competition and if there are few contestants offering offers, your bids may be higher."
"You've got two options: that's to pick up the people who are in the contract as participants in the competition, and that's to say, "Let's make a deal with satisfaction and a good price."
"But the main idea is that important is not the price, but the competence of people," said Mr Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Energie gérance consortium is part of the long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ on the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir has counted 109 engineering consulting contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with firms or their subsidiaries, in particular with laboratories carrying out soil analysis.
SNC-Lavalin acquired 22 contracts, of which Genivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a share in "Energie gérance".
All contracts were closed.
Together they count $449 783 344, including a contract with Energie gérance for $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard pointed out that four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor Group) are "very well known Quebec Liberal parties".
Minister Normandeau issued a report that the PQ was also linked to the companies that "funded it" before clarifying that one of its managers was more concerned with it.
Barometer responsible consumption - "green" label does not boost trust
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also in the "inside" labels and environmental certification, in order to manage accordingly in the selection of products.
The worst part is that even though we are buying in the media space that forces us and invites us to socially responsible consumption, this media space is calling for a lack of reliable information, a failure to fulfil obligations that even qualify as a brake for its commitment, Barometer points out the responsible consumptions, the first article of which came out yesterday.
Although the consumption of so-called social products in 2010 has increased, the people of Quebec, who are trying to sell them, still do not believe too much.
Two thirds of us actually say that they don't believe in the promises made by companies with regard to the environment, just because green advertising companies, they find a measuring instrument that was developed by the Observer for Responsible Consumption of the University in Sherbrooke.
Other findings: Half of consumers have doubts about the reliability of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also about the reliability of the products and labels that are referred to as ecologically responsible, indicate Barometer.
In the same way, the policy debate on this issue is adopted as a serious only 14.6% of Quebec's population.
However, information on responsible consumption appears to be a first step towards stimulating this website of consumption, which is now being recovered by almost one third of Quebec users.
Indeed, the vacuum and the questionable nature of the information would reduce the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Barometer at a higher price of these products.
Last but not least, a third of the inhabitants of Quebec are relying on the information provided about the products or the "green" services we are looking for to let them go through with our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and in particular to change the brand of one or more products, which would respond to their beliefs.
A total of 61% of them made purchases to traders from their quarter and gave preference to the purchase of food grown in their region, says Barometer.
More "green" and responsible - responsible consumption index reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québec is happy to present itself as a king of recycling, who strives for the least environmental impact by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and environmental awareness remained somewhere outside their vehicle, says Barometer: in 2010, almost 28% of Quebec's inhabitants said they were using public transportation or recommending the use of a car to drive at least two people in order to protect nature.
The walk and the wheel also supported 39.1% of the participants in this extensive study of behavior who used this cliché.
State loan to rent a complex eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which we asked for a financial contribution to the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris Angus et le Parallele, agrees with the participation, but only to the amount of the loan.
The development company "Angus et le Parallelèle", which sought a donation of $7 million from the Minister of Culture for the purchase of a cinematographic complex in Saint-Laurenta and which proved its mission as a movie artist, did not receive what she requested.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but under its own terms.
More than the expected gift is proposed by the Government of Quebec for a loan, which would otherwise have been lower, some initial expectation that could provide a basis for viable solutions under favourable conditions and with resources from the State.
The first action plan and the 12.8 million requirement were already rejected by Quebec last year in the spring, but applications have already been reviewed for reduction.
The proposal and the action plan were sent by the Minister of St-Pierre, President of the Society for the Development of entrepreneurship in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallel et Angus has time until December 31st to answer.
However, it appears that the State's gift hypothesis must really be rejected.
Note that the Association of Cinema owners and cinematographic centers in Quebec has been opposed to the state's direct investment in order to be able to support the purchase of eXcentris, considering that the Minister of Culture should not finance a property project if he did not do so for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several participants in the debate called for basic economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into the space of his films over ten years of film art after he himself funded the complex building, which could have been the reason for the state's financial board change.
The lack of rooms for independent films is circular in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to get a constant clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his head, is leading a campaign to release financial resources into the private sector, in the belief that it will save $700,000 to push out the stock market.
Since spring 2009, the only three film companies, Le Parallel, continue to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27th next year and celebrate the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't remember Le Devoir, so he ignores it, he and his group think about the proposals for reduction that were made to him.
Raised tires in Canada as a whole...
The new American diplomatic frameworks, known through WikiLeaks, reveal what the United States considers to be a complex minority of Canadians against Americans, but the impact reflects their feeling of superiority over Canada.
American diplomats are therefore amazed that every Canadian electorate is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when it comes to elections, and they believe that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government to accept her budget in 2009.
Four new reports from the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, last night on public notice, provide additional sensitive details to get each other "under the skin".
The communication with the date of 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details the point where the United States is not part of the commitments discussed by the political leaders.
To the great surprise of the U.S. embassy in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides several explanations to this situation.
"The Canadian minority complex, almost ingenious, reminds perhaps political leaders to talk about internal commitments instead of realizing that these elections concern the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)," she writes.
"The United States is, then," he concluded, "a literal island in these elections:all present, but potentially too dangerous to talk about them."
The emissary understands this "depressive silence" of the less that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, party or even better the leader of the party to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that the voters have in mind when they go to the elections."
Other expressions of this sense of importance can be read in the report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure that the government retains its confidence in the beginning of February in respect of the federal budget, which Canada publicly recognises its first deficit for more than ten years, for the recovery plan of between $30 billion and $40 billion," writes M. Breese.
There is no mention of the fact that the government had to reject the pre-annual parliamentary meeting so that it could not be defeated by coalitions and that the opposition parties recalled their survival in the quality of the proposed renewal plan.
Another report from January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins points out that Washington is still more negative , which is throwing dramatic series on the United States sent to the CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about sending Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there can be no too convincing references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or to kidnapping for the purpose of violent interrogations by the CIA.
Another report suggests that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to accept some prisoners with Guantanam.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the principle of "case-by-case".
At the end of the meeting, it says, "a paper about Omara Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, was handed over to the State Secretary."
"The Secrets have been accepted by reviewing the file."
Let's finally note that the people who are dealing with WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former consultant very close to Stephen Harper, announced on the CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "destroyed".
It came out and heard about it and Mike Huckaway in the United States.
World plan for the revitalization of light
Yesterday, the United Nations proposed a plan in Cancún to restore domestic lighting, light trade and industrial space in 100 countries with a view to achieving a glass effect limitation (GES), which corresponds to nearly one third of the next limit to be achieved in order to stabilise the climate of the planet from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the United Nations wants to launch in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult implementation commitments to reduce on the part of industrialised countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if sparked lamps, which monopolies up to 50 to 70% of the market, replace fluo-compact lamps or, even better, electroluminescent diodes (DEL or LED), the primary amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet would be depleted.
Illumination is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It's an equivalent of 70% emissions from the car park all over the planet.
In Kodana last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and other, including Canada, have engaged in voluntary plans to reduce that should allow the reduction of GES global emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will have to be removed from this balance sheet another 5 Gt to achieve the stabilisation of climate warming by 2020 at 2 degrees Celsius in order to exclude it from control.
In blasted lamps 95% of the energy is dissolved in the form of heat and residues, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluorinated lamps, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new LED lamps, we reduce this consumption twice again.
Fluo-compact lamps shall last from 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
New lamps with DEL, the ones that led Philips this week to produce - this company reportedly participated in the study of the United Nations - have the estimated lifetime of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than the light bulb, which gives us an idea of a possible savings with a refund plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with residues and produce less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts expressed reservations to fluo-compact lamps because they contain mercury and it is necessary to classify it as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers set up collections.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluo-compact lamp, but rather a warm coal power plant that emits many mercury needed to produce the electricity emitted in heated lamps.
In the United States alone, these centres run 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report also sets out in detail the benefits that each country would receive from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save billions of dollars annually for the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 heat plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion
The coasting of elephants eagerly awaits the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in the island Coast following the expiry of the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the preliminary results without delay, highlighted the US president's speaker."
"All parties in the Coast of Slovenia and the institutions are required to prove their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until notice of provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the highest date - the middle of the night - to come, without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's collapse.
About 40 minutes before the deadline was set, President CEI confirmed that the Commission "continued to work" in order to be able to deliver the results.
On Wednesday , the world-wide challenges were multiplied to finally declare the name of the winner of the second round, between the retreating Laurent Gbagbo and the opposition member Alassan Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is based on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for the "underwater" vote in the north, which is being corrected by the former New Army (FN) from a failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in the Ivory Coast, confirmed that the manoeuvres of threatening the wills practiced by the United Nations (New Army) in the north of the country have disproved the presence of the president of the Ivory Coast from going to the election.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council looked at the complaint put before Gbagbo.
However, President Gbagbo's supporters believe that the highest court of the country is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political associate of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who demises any connection with the former rebels, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has suffered loss and that submitting a complaint to the Constitutional Council after defending the election commission from sending the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, held on Sunday, was considered to be the coronation of the process of reunification and alignment of the country, which has been divided into two and a half years.
The United Nations pointed out in the mid-Political Group of the Côte d'Ivoire that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished his first round on October 31, as a winner with 38% votes against 32% for Alassana Ouattaru, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The measure of unemployment in France, in terms of words according to the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable at 9.3% in the Metropolitan France (9.7% including the overseas areas), as shown by the provisional data on seasonal deviation corrections (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed was 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in metropolis and 9.7% of the marine area.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1.
In the wider picture, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but they would like to work, regardless of whether they are or are not available for two weeks to work and whether they are looking for or not looking for work.
The current situation of young people on the labour market has yet to rise to 24.2% in the metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% in the maritime areas.
In the third quarter, there were 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24.
In the case of seniors, these have recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as in the year), which is 482,000 people from 50 years of age and 6.6% of those in eastern France.
Only the population aged 25-49 recorded benefits from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point in three months, +0.1 point in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after the debate on its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union Statistical Agency, on the contrary, continues to produce monthly statistics and announced a 9.8% rate in October for France (including DOM) after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is accused and imprisoned
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the heads of the waste management companies and the brother of PS Bouches-du-Rhône, was accused and imprisoned in the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the course of a public procurement investigation, allegedly subjugated.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of abuse of the property of the company, abuse of public funds and public property, concealment, payment, acceptance of fees for the purpose of influencing the office and holding the shooting, his lawyer states.
"Alexandre Guérini is a fighter and insists on explaining to the judge all the questions that he intends to ask, and not any overcrowding."
"It's easy to track her for a lot of criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove it," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told his client.
Mr Guérini informed his lawyers that he had sent a brief statement to the judge before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his close friends, Philippe Rapezi, was also accused and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simona, his client has never done anything else than to ensure the functioning of the cabinets he was supposed to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew of anything like that, Mr. Simon said.
In this regard, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of Aubagne's services, was charged on Wednesday with abuse of public funds and plots, and left to be free, under judicial supervision, to meet with the ban, the protagonists of all matters.
"My client has been able to provide an explanation for all the facts that have been revealed to him."
"The investigating judge will take care of it and let it go," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
The other four persons were accused and released at night from Tuesday to Wednesday, by being under judicial supervision for the two of them, the representative of the state superintendent Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director-general with the elegance of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is committed to receiving payments for the purpose of affecting the Office and for passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Briguier agglomeration, are charged with one for "disposal and abuse of the property of the company", the other for "complexity in the abuse of public funds".
Finally, commercial partner Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "disposing the abuse of the company's property".
Among those who were confronted with Mr Guérin is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently accused in a similar case of fraudulent public contracts concerning Corsica.
The investigators suspect his company that they helped to make money out of a vast gangstery.
The investigation shall be conducted in the context of several open trials against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in closing public contracts, in particular in the matter of waste.
From the source of the close investigation, the survey focuses in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of the plant in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities in the city of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: The Elysian Palace overrun the Syrian mediators
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klotildy Reissov, a young research worker arrested in Iran for "spionage", united his views in France, introduced diplomacy into the war preparedness and stressed the relationship between Paris and Tehran.
All of this has been closely monitored by U.S. diplomats.
American documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elyse Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such cases by hand in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how leading French representatives tried to convince Washington that the release of young French was not compensation for the release of Majida Kakavanda, the Iranian prisoner in France and the American court sought for underground trade in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they undermine the sharp light of the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Clotildy Reiss.
He actually didn't do anything about it.
Diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the title: "Iran:Francous comments on how to deal with hostages".
Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa's Middle East, Patricia Paoli, spoke with the American diplomat Allegrone.
They're explaining his French method.
They recommend that the Americans do the same in order to be transported back to their own countrymen by violence detained in Iran.
"Do the noise," they say, "always say "in the media the words "the fundamental right of man", "innocence", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to bring into disrepute an Iranian regime that is sensitive to its image.
"Do it the more they'll ask you to stop it."
Because attempts have been made to negotiate through discreet channels, "the silence does not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters of avoiding manoeuvres".
Mr. Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "the Iranian family of tactics: taking hostages for the purposes of "political extermination".
It states that the liberation of Clotildy Reissov (which will take place on 16 August, on the day the French Embassy gives it refuge) "requests the payment of a high financial amount to the Iranians" (see EUR 230,000).
And they'll announce that the Elyse Palace is anticipating cases of hostages, a phenomenon that will "resurrection".
The Iranians could "in the future arrest about 1800 French people living in Iran", he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilda Reissova left prison 12 days ago, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, which the United States declares was released for illegal trafficking in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
The American embassy, as well as many observers, is asking for this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, which pursues an illegal Iranian network to obtain a nuclear program material, the deployment of Majida Khakavanda is a bad news.
France agreed to a contract?
Freedom of the Iranians for the liberation of the young French?
In another conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier makes sure it isn't.
The Elyse Palace, as it has been said, was not only "astounded by this judge's decision", but was looking for an opportunity to stand up to it.
"The talks between the President's Office and the Minister of Justice took place" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the decision of the court," he notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakovand is under "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Council of the Elysian Palace is turning the phone number off, hangs the phone, and then informs the American diplomat that Iran is currently in the Paris buildings run by the Iranian embassy."
At the time of Klotildy Reissov's imprisonment in Iran, the Elyse Palace develops efforts, negotiates, through communications and organized "only" media to convince Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad to play "significant" and "impressive" role.
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that manipulation takes its fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the official French version.
Telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blast" of French officials".
What is the basis of such a "thank you" measure, expressed to M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"Even with their declaration, full of praise, French officials in private admit that they have only a valid idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that the Elyse Palace has forced to pay in this fiction.
The intensive communication "directs to the validation of the policy of President Sarkozy's opening to Syria", analyzes.
Policy implemented in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved".
By "how to overcome the Syrian role", Paris is trying to "demonstrate Syria what praise can be given when it plays a constructive role in the area".
The aim is also "to plant a grain barrier between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a very good source.
August 11, François Richier confided to him: "We certainly don't know if the Syrians have done anything, whatever it is"
"But we thanked them anyway."
"That should at least bring in the confusion and uncertainty among the Iranians."
Clotilda Reissov is returning to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to Elise Palace.
In the communication, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the benefit of the liberation of our country".
End of online game after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Peciválski", which will prevent adolescents from playing online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, the responsible government actors have introduced.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December in order to ask for companies operating online games to block access to these games after the fall of 16 years, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family have introduced.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems with school learning and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the head of the ministry, who has a bill on care.
Online games will be newly available from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, to clarify.
The government also assumes that it requests companies to limit daily access time to these games for young people whose parents are asking for it to be supplemented by a responsible worker.
It also provides free programs to people who ask for it, allowing them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the country's most "weakest" and daily press brings regularly different facts related to intensive internet use.
At the same time, the country is an indisputable champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at World Cyber Games, which faces 58 other nations.
World Championship in 2018-2022: Fifa establishes host countries.
Full of concern over corruption suspicion, Fifa’s Executive Committee will set up a selection on Thursday of the World Cup host country in 2018 and 2022, which is politically motivated, where the fight against influence and lobbying risks ahead of the technical criteria.
The thing is certain, the Royal Fifa competition in 2018 will take place in Europe , the traditional garden of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 Championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping it will be able to acquire new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the 2010 African continent premiere, or continue to be established in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
A list of the personalities involved in the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, and Cruyff) offers the opportunity to create an idea of measuring the economic and political statements of the whole world.
Negotiation in the background is at risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to Fifa's evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portugal (2018) and American (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as their competitors' documentation.
However, these reasons will not be too important for the 22 members of the Executive Board at the time appointed for the vote.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the revelation, leading to the suspension of two members of the EC /European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarie et Amos Adamu) may thus have destroyed the chance of his country, a collegiate mine, which has since hosted the world championship only once a year.
The BBC imposed a crown on it on Monday when it sent a document that "written on a pen" by three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa unhappy and bring into trouble the English leader with David Cameron in the first row.
The president hopes that he will be able to repeat the experience of his predecessor in the role of Tony Blair, who managed to win the 2012 London Olympics.
Will this intensive activity suffice for England to add a new light to its name at the EC (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain because the two Spanish-Portugal do not miss the drums of the already prepared stadiums, its well-being (The World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloudy economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
The appropriate legal measures against the English and the doubts about the payment capacity of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider even through the gaps in its documentation (stations, hotels, transport).
But the president of the government, Vladimir Putin, decided that the championship was not moving to Zurich and publicly declared 'no competition in the preparation of the vote', in verbal attacks only barely charged with the English press against the members of the EC (European Commission).
"We'll throw them in the blue, try to compromise them," said Mr. Putin.
For 2022, they seem to be a logical favorite of the United States with their significant experiences since 1994.
The world's highest economic performance, the home of Fifa's main sponsors, seems to have a great drive ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have developed a beautiful project.
But these candidatures seem to be premature for both countries, which jointly passed the "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the 2026 World Championships in China, which feverishly desires Fifa, made the Asian chance for 2022 invalid.
With Katara, who pulled out of the glove of a large eos in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue in its expansion into new landscapes, but these two countries represent more risks than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, would be able to spy for the four-hour TV charges (for the time movement) paid by European countries, forming a mobile force for Fifa.
Second mandate: visibility (security)
De Gaulle really did.
Mitterrand has raised his opinion that he weighs.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not escape at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
Mandate Elisey's palace calls someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be the candidate in 2012.
Obviously, however, it is not in good faith with the share of the secret associated with the presidential function.
It is therefore necessary to act as if the doubts persist.
In one and the other sense.
In 2006, or would you like to believe it, friends of Jacques Chirac made claims not to be excluded from the third mandate.
On 15 November, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy made sure that "sometimes it will be decided in the autumn of 2011".
As the members of the UMP parliament recall Wednesday night in the Palace of Elyse, the perspective of the "two mandates" has been a little hot.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President only recalled that the revision of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year functional periods to two.
It was just his findings, not his announcement.
It's not the first time he remembers the humourous tone of the presidential election at such meetings.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you have yet seven and a half years with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: "Don't think I don't consider another stage."
His previous judgments will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; nor will they make him a candidate or less.
If they're making comments, it's because of two truths.
Speeding the way to the PS candidate, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to Ségolène Royal's collaborator, which pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want to organize the fighting structures more early than intended.
Bad research on the other side.
First, right-wing voters would prefer Françoise Fillon's candidacy against Nicolas Sarkozy's candidacy (46%) versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have candidates and we don't discuss the issue with the UMP," they responded immediately and cautiously to people from the closest environment to the government's president.
"If they believe possible defeat, they won't run," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe that he can win," corrects Alain Juppe, who is clearly balanced.
Euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue its procurement of public securities.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of Central Governors of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for the withdrawal of the crisis or, at least, a notice of the suspension of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations to be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of European demand commitments, the institution for issuing securities will certainly not be able to allow itself to be so categorical under the threat of deterioration of the situation that is already so acute in European securities markets today.
The political price would be higher in that case.
Yesterday, at the occasion of the press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde gave up the hold of an active role played by the European Central Bank in the favour of resolving the crisis in demand by the European states.
She didn't mean to say if she thought the bank could do more, for example, by increasing their program to buy over bonds.
"I take my view of my European partners (...)".
The evening before, in Brussels, when the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear as more specific as regards his intentions, and he was satisfied that he stated that the programme for the purchase of state securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see how we will decide" during the meeting that will take place on Thursday.
The only guarantee: the European Central Bank will monitor its basic unchanged interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchase of bonds by the Central European Bank has doubled by nearly EUR 1.35 billion over the last week.
And because of the lack of understanding of the buyers on the market, she made yesterday a new purchase of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
The Eurosystem’s total central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt between the buyers on the market of anticipating the continuation of the purchase (see page 29).
Nor do economics expect any significant change in the course.
If the lending operation has already disappeared for more than three months from the European Central Bank’s arsenal, this latter appointed bank shall access the unlimited provision of liquid assets under the high conditions and for a period of one week to three months.
Economics today expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine that she would change her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean taking the risk of creating a short-term new tension," says Michael Schubert, a Commerzbank economist.
"The progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," says Norbert Brams, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its public debt market interventions, "the European Central Bank must maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds to revitalise the soft market," Norbert Brams adds.
Given the exposure of European banks to the euro area debt, there is nothing more to be chosen than to keep their presence on the market.
"It is necessary to replace the lack of investors on the market at any price and to act in such a way as to prevent the development of the payment performance of the states that belong to the most fragile," a significant bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if the interest rates are lifted, the States will be more concerned with reducing their debt rather than stabilizing it.
It's the saving of the euro for this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is behind the back
At the beginning of the week, the worrying situation for Italy was a little relaxed, yesterday with a return rate of 10 years.
Return to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Prime Minister for Economics, the presidents said they heard Giulia Tremonti qualified as "unsolved" and expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then demented.
In any event, the record of 210 basic points was reached in Tuesday's departure from long German interest rates and the price of the contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) dropped to 263 points, resulting in a certain disturbance in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the deviation from German interest was higher than 400 basic points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, declared himself "too busy" "with the booming development of the markets" and possible infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third eurozone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the absence of growth and indistinct fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and exposes it to the risk that it will not be able to cover its funding needs.
The last forecasts of Brussels were cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is expected to be 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, calculated by the European Commission, the public finances deficit will represent another 4.3% of the gross domestic product next year (as against 3.9% of the government forecast) and 3.5% in 2012 (as opposed to 2.7%).
From this point of view, a new summary of the additions to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new stringent measures will have to be adopted", evaluation by Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
"The basic stones of its economies are fine and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating it for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Governing Council of the International Monetary Fund under the pressure of Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, no short-term or long-term, because through its significant debt (119.2% of the gross domestic product 2011, NDLR), the effort to stabilise the demand in Italy is less than the effort required by the other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD’s main economy.
There is a question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a proposal for the declaration of mistrust by the Embassy and could then begin to organise the elections that will be held at the end of March.
This would be the beginning of a period, which is not appropriate for a decision in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde again stressed this yesterday during the press conference in Paris: "I think Europeans have demonstrated it during Sunday and night, are obviously very solidarityal determinations, commitment to defend their currency and their monetary zone."
Although everything is relative, last night's recorded expansion regarding interest on European state bonds, it has brought water to a million governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The Office for Ratings Standard & Poor's announced that it could downgrade the record of Portugal's debt, the goal to which various speculations are most focused.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and clear policy, particularly on banking systems," says Economic Exane BNP Paribas.
More that "political time runs slower than market time."
The knowledge of this interrupted relationship and the threat that it conceals intensifys the European countries' discussions aimed at strengthening the already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultation between finance ministers, the most affected problem, and, to a broader extent with their G20 counterparts, they are developing very well.
This is in view of the Eurogroup meetings (Eurogroup) and the Ecofin meeting from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the European Central Bank is taking place today.
The programme contains a decision on non-conventional measures to support the euro area countries with a market focus (see above).
With regard to the European Fund for Finance (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, launched a trip to Singapore on Tuesday to Asia to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If it is not the aim of this road to raise funds, the donor will thus prepare the country to achieve this goal.
The first issue of EFSF securities is foreseen for the next month.
Yesterday, the US official announced to Reuters that the United States would support the possible increase in mobilised funds by additional direct involvement in the IMF.
The countries referred to in the first series, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that attach themselves to a rapid-effect measure.
Lisbon and Madrid are different from those used by Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid, at all costs, applying for international aid before applying for their own budgetary corrections and before deciding on structural reforms necessary to regain lasting confidence.
The capital participants in the European Funds are finally talking about options available to speed up the process of normalising markets with overcompensated bonds.
On their way to Paris on November 24th, Axel Weber came up with the idea that the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not be more than a risk to the Union to reclaim the stock of securities.
The economics of Barclays Capital, which is an actor of the very first plan of dealing with European claims, considers that the addendum of about EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "better" in the form of direct financial liquidity provision.
The medium exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which is up to this day 60 billion euros.
The Council, which has every chance of being tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions worsened.
Snow and rain: 24 countries have orange emergency.
The snowsports are still causing transport difficulties, especially on the roads of the other classes in Britain, and there is a risk of disruption of some economic activities.
Twenty-four periods since now have an orange emergency due to the risk of snow and floods.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, Les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne, joined the 20 periods that have already been declared orange emergency, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, significant snowfalls occur in the north of La Gironde and les Charentes and weak snow on Ile-de-France.
The snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the periods concerned and covers from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions are affected.
The snowflakes are large enough to cause transport difficulties and disrupt some economic activities, says Météo France.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some periods have prohibited the passage of heavy cargo transport - cargo cars above 7.5 tons with the Guingamp-Lannion route and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on the second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, and police recommend driving with their vehicle only if it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
School connections were banned in Picardia on Thursday.
On Wednesday evening, no special measures are envisaged to limit freight transport.
The district authority "calls all drivers of cars to be the most careful on the roads and to adapt the vehicle's nature".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has requested airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% at Orly due to expected snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that a passenger using air transport services connect with his company.
In the United Kingdom, Gatwick airport in southern London and Edinburgh Airport are closed until Thursday morning in Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on modernising transport to Ile-de-France in full-flow, it's been worth billions.
At least during the discussion.
We particularly recall 23 billion on the Grand Paris metro, which is to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
In order to enable this building to be released, he announced the granting of a grant of EUR 4 billion.
It is theoretically the amount that will then allow SGP to use for the contracts part of its double source financing.
We're finally getting to the first additions today.
The 2010 Financial Correction Act, which examines the National Assembly Financial Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms laid down to ensure these funds.
There are two: creating special tax from equipment and raising tax from office to Ile-de-France.
First, let's read in the text of the bill, Article 15, "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The revenue from this interest is 117 million euros a year."
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for an office, which already exists therefore, "to be modernised to increase its profit and to reach this increase to Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it cost?
Overcrowded.
That's not numbered in the text.
We've got up to 4 billion.
"It is clear that these fiscal resources are linked to 4 billion euros of capital aid that will be mobilised by the State and put into Société du Grand Paris according to the project," we can read in explaining the reasons.
In SGP we don't seem to be shocked by this system.
"From the time we created revenue (both taxes, etc.), we can cover the study for three years and then bury up to 4 billion, it's explained here."
"It will be included in the budget and used as necessary."
The SGP considers that 4 billion will be allocated to the 2013 budget for 2014.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised are still not available to subscribers, risks causing a somewhat disruptive parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
City hackers and coercive investigators
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, there is a public scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, he talks about profound changes at international level, and overcoming the future of controlled regression.
But let's do it.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm the fact that every document drawn up by a secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of prints.
"Excuseful revelation" Americans about the sex lifestyle of Berlusconi are saying what they could read every month in any newspaper (all except these two Berlusconi owns), and the caricature profile of Kadáfi has long been the object of a sketch for cabaret artists.
The rule, according to which secret documents may consist only of reports already known, is fundamental in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore that is dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that every work repeats (about Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Seventies) exactly what was already written in the previous sections.
And it's not just because the author of the occult texts does not like to search for new information (or doesn't know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned.
It's Dan Brown's mechanism of success.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informant is linear, and the boss of secret services (and if he is not, he could be, as I know, editor in the Liberian newspaper), who only counts as true what he admits himself.
Information with a high secret about Berluscon, which the U.S. embassy sent to the state resort, was the same as Newsweek published a week earlier.
Why, then, did the discovery of these documents take so many occasions?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, while the embassy, at least from the end of the second world war, and since the heads of the states can call or fly out on a common dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in the representation, turned into a Spanish center.
Any viewer following the film on the investigation knows very well that it seems to be ignored by the crowd.
However, the fact that it is repeated in public, a honological obligation to cover up and sheds the wrong light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most intimately hidden information from the world's most powerful country is a hard strike, not unbeatable, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both victims and their "victors".
But let's move from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Sometimes, in the days of Orwell, it was possible to grasp all power, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell’s prophecy has been proven since the time when, thanks to the ability to control every movement by telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, became a citizen of the total victim of power.
But when we demonstrate how it is now that even the "grapes" with the most classified information of the powerful cannot resist the hacker's intervention, the control message stops being one-way and becomes a circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least hacker - elected as the debtor of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can you maintain power that no longer has the ability to keep your own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that real secrets are infinite secrets (and infinite secrets will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel is a truly mysterious secret because it is derived from public life; but to discover, as WikiLeaks did, that the secret of Hillary Clinton was infinite secrets, means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks made no mistake at Sarkozy's or Merkel's, but he made something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound of saving power so significant?
It is clear that in the future States will not be able to send online sensitive information - this would be equal to its publication on a poster on the corner of the street.
But it's also quite obvious that with current technologies, there's too much hope that you can keep the message hidden on the phone.
It's nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of the state traveled by plane and connected with some of his colleagues.
How can they be kept in the future in private and sensitive reports ?
I know well that for this moment my prognosis belongs to science-fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine the government actors who are carrying discreetly the fulfillment of the formality on uncontrollable routes and carrying only those messages that they know to remember or rather hide rare information in the boot.
Information will be kept in unique copies in the cartridges sealed with the key: overall, the attempt to spy on the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had a chance to write that technology is now moving forward, that's what it means back.
One century after the wireless telegraph meant a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wires (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogues) enabled movie lovers to film step by step, slide it forward and back and reveal all the secrets of the installation, while now CD (digits) allow only jumping on the chapters, that means by macroports.
Through the rapids, we will come from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the way by plane and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that policy and communication technology will return to the horse-drawn vehicles.
Last note.
Jindy tried to understand what had become of the mystery of the embassy.
Now it's the embassy asking for reliable information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked its promises of financing
The year following the Codana Agreement is the time to test compliance with the pledges to rapidly delocked financing (as referred to as fast start or early start) implemented by developed countries.
And great French hacks were discovered
In the Codán Agreement, the developed countries committed to providing 30 billion dollars in 2010-2012.
The European Union promised EUR 7.2 billion for three years and EUR 1.26 billion for France (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
At the beginning of COP16, the EU drew out a large essay to convince its partners about the reality of its commitment to financing fast start: a report explaining the actions of its Member States, the press conference, the grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparent operations are unappreciable and valued at their real value: mature countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that in 2010 it has released 2.2 billion euros, leading it to the right path to comply with its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we find things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Codanese Agreement to ensure that the increased burden is realized without prejudice to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement in what it means "new and additional".
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, among others and France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone picks the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding has been maintained and it adds 150 million to it for three years the title of the fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references to annual payment terms or to public development aid terms.
On the contrary, France believes that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of the previous period or to the global level Public aid for the development of d'Aide brazilian au development.
In particular, France's overall amount of aid to developing countries can remain unchanged (or even be reduced), should comply with its commitment to financing "new and additional"...
Another determining factor is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There isn't a rule yet, and everyone chooses their own way of calculating.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ borrowed is equal to 1€ given.
Obviously, it is difficult to demonstrate: effort is not even.
If the use of the loan can be provided for some investments that are profitable (often related to projects associated with the reduction of emissions, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we will receive, as equivalent to one euro that we give... , we should not understand it from the title of our commitments, but as the price of the loan for the credit country (i.e. the equivalent of interest rates).
But France can only give the following reasons: "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros, making 91.5% of the loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of the gifts (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan to this extent.
Germany has requested 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) comply with their commitments with 100% gifts.
In other words, when the total majority of the European Union gives 1€ within the framework of its promise, France only gives 10 cents and considers this effort comparable.
A beautiful keg of kegs!
To sum up, when financing "fast start" France operates with two households: on the one hand, with the development of shares in time and on the other hand, with real financial burden.
Although he only spends 36.1 million euros, he can convince himself that he spends 420 million euros "new and additional" in connection with his promises.
Manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that while Bercy is the one who made such a decision) could have two negative effects, at the same time within the EU (why would the Member States continue to give when it is just borrowing?) and when negotiating, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter of early funding is only a small issue, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could also be a grain of sand in a huge machine, such as the UNICEF.
Let's hope it's not our case.
Whatever the case, it is necessary to draw on the knowledge of this first year of early funding.
First, France should notify the change in its way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of compliance with its obligations and compliance and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussions on long-term funding deposits (other key chapters currently discussed): we will not ignore the question of "additionality" or how to invest in loans.
France should change its position to become as progressive with these deposits as with others.
So the hopes of everyone are being put into the new Ministry of the Environment, Mrs Koscisko-Morizet, who will come to Cancún next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of the loan could lead to an increase in international confidence, which is necessary for further discussion.
An alarm about the pesticides that kids look at.
One day, the 10-year-old child was born with 81 different chemicals, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Education for the Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which notes that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the processed problem", bought between July and September food commonly consumed in four meals and one light food as a light snack for one child nearly a decade in supermarkets in L'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is sharp: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are among the carcinogenic substances, possible or likely, and five are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as harmful for internal mixing glands (PE), according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even though in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical adopted are not exceeded individually, in our research we see that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is infective," the association said.
For breakfast butter and tea with milk, they contain about ten residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as well as about 20 residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
Apple, imported from Brazil, studied as a small pot, contains traces of six chemicals, including the banned fungicide in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, which are included in the lunch in which studies have found the results of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, dairy steaks, tuna in the refrigerator and even ham and gum were sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals.
The presence of nitrogen and chloroform was detected in water from the sample.
The steak from salmon to dinner was "the richest" with 34 found chemical residues and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave tube did not escape analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this "cocathellum contaminants" is likely to be underestimated", according to the study.
Ecological Europe-Green Society (EE-LV) proposed "face to the emergency" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "growth of civilisation diseases".
In July, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) study examined the presence of 365 residues of various pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
