Wells's members are concerned that they "seem to be maps"
Some members of the congregation are surprised at their proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Belgian Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the congregation in the Belgian Parliament.
Members of the congregation of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this may be the subject of ridicule.
A member of the Labourist Party's congregation said his party was concerned that "remains with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak Welsh: on Welsh twp means "crazy/crazy", and pwp means "like".
A member of Plaid said the party was completely "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said parts of his party were "free" to change the name, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "muppet" (Muppet) is great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the Yorkshire-English statement of the letter "u".
The Committee of the People's Assembly, which is currently preparing a law for the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision on any words to which members of the congregation will be named will, of course, bring the members themselves."
Wells' 2017 government law has given Wells's congregation the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on proposals that indicated strong support for the congregation's appointment as a Velski parliament.
On the question of the name of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Belgian Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the greatest support from public consultation.
Members of parliament propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can cause headaches for the congregation's president, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft law for changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes to the way the congregation works, including rules on disqualification of members of the congregation and the design of the committee system.
Members of the congregation will give the final vote on the question of their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote on a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote Sunday to change their country's name in "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was put in place in an attempt to resolve the decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a right to its territory and has consistently opposed the country's EU and NATO membership efforts.
Macedonian President Djirge Ivanov, an opponent of the name-change plebiscite, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the change of name is simply the price to be paid for entry into the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s Wright was silenced while the churches in Harlem faced problems
"Historic, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's no one else."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing differently today," he said.
"The barons are no longer living rooms in the settlements where people go regularly."
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started".
The churches, he added, can replace with buildings full of people who will not help the rest of the shrines in the settlement.
"Most people who buy apartments in those buildings are white," he said, "and that's why it's going to accelerate the day when these churches will close completely because it's not likely that most of the people who move into these buildings will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built from white congregations in front of Harlem to become the metropolis of the Blacks — the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white-methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
The congregation of blacks who practice their faith nearby takes over the property of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the Black Congregation during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of vendors on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or advance blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but since the members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the trailer.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son, and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called the caravan "the call of the poor."
The expert who played the cartoon in July called it "cultural wealth" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carione in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the largest carione in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriveter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part brought by the inconvenient leaders of the church, and part of the bishop's parish.
The Church Committee – the church’s management body, composed of informal leaders – writes to the parish in July with concern that the parish “will be required to transfer its expenses” to the church committee, although the church committee was not involved in the employment of the architects and entrepreneurs who sent the parish.
Some parish members complained of a lack of transparency by the parish.
shark injured a 13-year-old kid in a jasper dive in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while a lobster pump in California on the day of opening the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack took place about 7 hours ago near Bikon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel reported on the TV KSWB in San Diego that he had bluffed with friends about an hour in the morning when he heard the boy shout for help and then hung up to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel said he first thought it was excited to catch the lobster, but then "he realized that he was shouting, 'I'm late!
You're late!'
His whole key bone was looking at him," Hamel said he noticed after he got to the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hamel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, which is set up as a critical condition.
We don't know what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Gills, told the press conference that a shark had been reported in the area a few weeks earlier, but they decided that sharks were not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed the beach from Ponto Beach in Kassalad to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most do not consider them dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans enter the United Kingdom's beauty market
Sainsbury's takes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with nice-style flats full of professional assistants.
As part of the significant market for beauty in the United Kingdom that weighs 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and household are falling, large beauty valves will be tested in 11 stores all over the country, and will also be presented in more shops next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty appeared after supermarkets began looking for ways to use the space of the rafts that was once intended for televisions, microwave ovens and household appliances.
From Sainsbury's said for the first time they would double the offer of beauty funds to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with fuelled areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunchs its Boutique series, so most of the products are suitable for veganzas, something that is increasingly required of younger consumers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfumer will test concessions in two Sainsbury shops, the first of which opened in Creedon, South London, last week, and the second opened in Selie Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the trend of buying smaller amounts of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Cup, Sainsbury's director, said stores would increasingly look like business houses because the supermarket chain is trying to fight the discounts Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's started putting Argos' stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after he bought both chains two years ago, which they said increased the sales of groceries and made the purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and pharmaceutical departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested jointly with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after a disagreement on how to share the profit from chemical stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores in Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hex, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our rafts of beauty to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a compulsory destination for beauty that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "barred" after Holly Willowby withdraws from a contract worth 11 million pounds.
The star Peter Jones of Dragons Den went "slow" after TV leader Holly Willowby withdrew from a deal worth 11 million pounds with his brand-new life-style business to focus on her new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowby has no time for their brand True for products and household supplements.
The two's business is related to the Goop brand of Guineat Paltrou.
This 37-year-old morning program leader told Instagram he was leaving.
Holly Willowby left Peter Jones, the Dragons Den star, withdrawing from their profitable life-style branding business at the last moment to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say Jones was "barred" when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday in the seat of his business empire in Marlov, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – mean that she no longer have time to dedicate herself to their brand True for products and household supplements.
The business is linked to the Goop brand of Guineat Paltrou and was said to double Willowby's wealth by an estimated 11 million pounds.
As 37-year-old Willowby told Instagram that he left True, Jones soon left Britain in one of his weekends.
One source said: “Truly has always been at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was to be her long - term future that she would send in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all the affected caught them utterly unwilling.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday was so close to the opening.
In Marlow's seat there's a warehouse full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that leaving this morning's programme guide, which is one of Britain's most paid stars, can cost the company millions because of large investments in products from pennies and candles, as well as clothing and household products and the potential for further delay.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin's wife have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willowby should become an ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as a leader of I'm A Celebrity (I'm a star) on ITV.
A source close to Jones yesterday said, "We don't comment on his business vices."
A Serious Conversation “Then We fell in love ”
He was joking about the criticism he would get from the media to comment that some would consider him "unprecedentary" and because he is so positive to North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump said with his voice he was transformed as "the news representative".
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearization have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the world's leaders of the UN's main assembly that the North does not see the "responsibility" of the United States for the early moves of North Korea to disarmament.
Instead, he said, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump takes a much more optimistic view of his speech at the meeting.
"We agree perfectly with North Korea," he said.
"We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
We now have this excellent cooperation."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results – they finished the missile tests, helped free hostages and the remaining US soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this full arena, we'll have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd before him.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and took hundreds of lives
As a result of the earthquake in Lombard, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombard population was displaced, an elemental accident was not declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it is a challenge," Mr. Sumbung said.
Although "Save the Children" is a team that will travel to Palo, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palou to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that continue to strike Indonesia, the country remains desperate for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters in Aceh have been built, they are not a common sight on the other shores.
The apparent lack of siren to warn of tsunamis in Palo, although warning was given, was likely to contribute to the loss of life.
At best, traveling across many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for treatment of the victims of the earthquake has headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
The main point in the election campaign of President Joko Vidodo was the improvement of Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and roads.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of the re-elections next year.
Mr. Yoko is also facing pressure from sex tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using swords, bows, and other old weapons.
See: Daniel Starridge of the Liverpool team at the same time as Chelsea.
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Prime Minister's goal in 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri gave Starij's ball to about 30 yards of Chelsea's hat, while his team lost with 1 - 0.
He transferred the ball to the left before pointing to the distant article.
The ball was moving high over the sixteenth as it turned to the right corner of the network.
The ball finally passed through the jumped Kepa Arisabalag and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get in that position, get to the ball, and players like Shak always give up as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible," Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I just touched her and didn't think much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea took 1 - 0 at half-time after the Belgian star One Hazard hit the goal in 25 minutes.
The "floor attacker" turned the fifth back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before he smashed the ball almost to half the ground, and then with a sprint passed into the middle of Liverpool.
They quickly gave themselves to Kovacic in the middle of the field.
He then headed for the missile, leading Hazard to the sixteenth.
Hazard went through the defense and finished on the network of the far-off article with a left-leg impact next to Alison Baker in Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Napoleon in the group phase of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at San Paulo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the WEFA League of Europe at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people are trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell into a 7.5-inch earthquake that hit Friday and caused 20-degree waves, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was surrounded by the ruins of the ruined buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Mercedesside.
Forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7.55 with Grayson Movs stabbing wounds on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who saw or heard something to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but it would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenhead, who saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I also want to ask people, especially the cab drivers, who may have recorded something on the cameras from the cars to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
Police spokesperson that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhed and that it was found in an object.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the scene of the crime to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and as the police have said, they will inform the people near the victim.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Movs just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him it was not allowed to go in, or get out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents were now told that hours would pass before they could return.
Someone heard a cop tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared.
She keeps saying, "It's so horrible."
At 2.00, two police vans were on the border, and another one was outside.
Countless policemen were standing in the border and watching the apartments.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime Fighters at 0800 555 111, quoting a record 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's parliament's status has become the newest memory strike in the kareak for "rewriting history"
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure before the Westminster Chamber would become a target.
The English Civil War Iconoclass was neither ordered nor issued by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestors, Thomas, in the previous century.
Cromwell’s beautiful presentation of Ser William Hamo Thornejcroft is evidence of 19th - century opinion and part of the story of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith said about The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of a continued historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord-Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
A pig-killer broke up and killed a Chinese farmer.
Pigs attacked and killed a market farmer in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the name of "June", was found dead with the skin artery, bound in blood near the market in Liupanshui in Gicou, South China, said Morning Post on Sunday.
Pig farmer is preparing to place pigs' vaccines on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Kinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door from the neighboring pig’s cart.
He said that there was a large calf with the blood of the bull.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the heavy-weighted fork broke down the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and broken," said the cousin, named "Wu", according to the quote in the evening news of Guyana.
The security camera footage showed Juan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to John or his cousin.
The market manager said about the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent other people from attacking, while the police collect evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market leaders are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pigs that attacked humans have been reported earlier.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the husband.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig tied a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife drove the animal out.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an "activator".
"They're just playing."
They want to grin, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone intentionally.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves through the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain showers to the northern part of Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, a hurricane of 1 from 5 a.m. east time on Sunday and was located 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression over the Pacific Ocean is beginning to develop and is moving east toward the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday, as a tropical storm will begin to bring a large tropical rainstorm north into the southwestern part of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico's shares on Monday.
Then, the tropical depression that is approaching will produce abundant rains in the southeastern part of the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden flooding, the flow of debris, and possible landslides in the desert.
The great tropical moisture will cause storms that in some places will be about 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the south-west, especially in most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible due to the rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It is particularly recommended not to go in the desert walk with the possibility of tropical rain.
Some rains may cause the canyons to become stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring local rain to parts of the South California coast.
A total of more than half an inch of rain is possible, which may cause rivers of debris and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region of their wet season.
Temporal tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early in the morning on Monday before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Some rain will be extended in the "four eagles" on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected everywhere in the United States due to the Arctic ice, but the tropical boundaries remain high.
This sometimes leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of the short distance.
A great example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will be in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost 20 degrees difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moyn, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to reinvigorate and expand.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to have a warm beginning of October with high temperatures at 80 degrees south of the plains to the veroristo.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long - term forecast points to the possibility of average temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States, up to the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brad Cavano's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the exciting testimony on Thursday of the nominated candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Kristina Blassi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the uninterrupted political situation continued, with speakers interrupting regular conversion programmes last Friday: Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, made an agreement with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate court committee that it was 100 percent sure that Cavano had taken a drink and tried to take off her high school clothes.
Cavano, in his passionate witnessing, said it was 100 percent certain that it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen said, saw it on Friday.
The company included average visibility of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks they showed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's usually having trouble measuring people looking at the office.
To make it look better, it's a audience with a size similar to a football game or the awards of the movie academy.
The Fox News channel, whose leaders strongly attacked Cavano's appointment, ran ahead of all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the day-to-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in the Friday drama.
Since moderately the Republican Office issued a statement that it would vote for Kawano, the CNN and CBS cameras captured him as protestors called on him Friday morning while he was trying to enter the elevator for hearing the judicial committee.
He was standing with his eyes pressed for a few minutes while he was being beaten, and all of this was being carried alive to CNN.
"They're standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the earth"?
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flex said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator door, that there would be more to say during the committee's hearing.
Cable and radio networks all covered hours later, when the judicial committee was due to vote to advance Kawano's nomination in the polling session.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider charges against the nominated next week, which was requested by the minority of democracies.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversation with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After the conversation with Kuns, and with several senators then, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was of great significance, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavano without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Cavano.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for "playing politics" on the coast
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "playing politics" with the British future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview right up to her main page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Bregzit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the loan costs is "completely absurd".
Fire at Wade Sims: Police arrested Suspect Diton Simson for the death of a sportsman at Louisiana State University
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Diethon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder, Baton Rose's police department said.
The authorities posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB partner of CBS said.
After Simpson was interrogated, the police said that he admitted that he shot Wade and killed him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the pathologist of East Baton Rose's parish announced the preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death was shot in the head to the neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the criminalist police lab, the South University Police and the citizens of the area for the aid they provided in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for her "activism in search of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6.6-step beak grew up in Baton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 hits per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, coach of the basketball team at Louisiana State University, Will Wade, said the team was "unified" and "in shock" since Sims' death.
"This is what you care about without stopping," the coach said.
Volcano threw ashes over Mexico City
The casting of ashes from the Volcano Popokatepetl reached the southern inhabited places of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go to the volcano after it started activity in the crater and 183 gas and ashes emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was following more tattoos and shakes.
Social media images show a thin layer of ashes on cars in the inhabited places of Mexico City, such as Sochimilko.
Geophysicists observed an increased activity of a volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Gojo has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists before the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protestors clashed with the police for public order and peace and after thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote for the removal of Catalonia.
A group of masked supporters of separatists detained by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint into the right, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Later on the day they also beat fights, and the police used their thumbs to narrow down the fights.
For more than a few hours, the independence groups called "No forgetfulness, No Forgiveness", and on the other hand, union protestors called "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries received in protests, said local press.
The tensions are still high in the region that wants independence, one year after Madrid characterized the referendum on 1 October as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catholics.
Most voters voted for independence, although the outcome was small because of the boycott by people who oppose separation.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried violently to stop the vote at the polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped through the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations to support the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
Six and eight-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes that Catalonia has a chance to gain independence.
"We lived one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they won a vital but close victory of the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties struggled to keep the dynamics this year with many of their most well-known leaders or in self-elected pursuit or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, filming a protest to support the police, said the conflict was supported by politicians from both sides.
"It's all becoming intense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in prison before last year's trial, announced that he will run the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after car crashing into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeated car hits in a house in Londonbury.
The incident occurred in Balinagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said damage to the gate and to the building itself was caused.
At one point, it could be fired by a suicide shot.
Menga's hit on Livingston from 1 - 0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston provides victory
The advanced Livingston posted the Rangers signing Steven Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's guess turned out to be significant while Gary Hold's country rose to a level with Hibernian at second position.
The country of Gerard has lost its victory in the season and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind which they are left with eight points.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in Europe the League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues to be invincible in the division during six competitions, and Coach Holt has not yet faced a defeat since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston missed the chance against the harsh guests
Holt's team was supposed to take a long time before they gave the target, and their directness caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson tried, but he pulled the attack around the goal, and then Alan Litgo could only direct his efforts far after he slided the blow with Craig Halket's head over the goal.
The guests gladly left the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems with the actions set.
And that's exactly how the fate goal came.
Rangers missed a free shot, and Livingston got the opening, Declan Galagher and Robinson put Manga together, which only hit the target from the center of the 16th century.
Until then, Rangers dominated the ball possession, but they couldn't break the host's defense, so Gollman Liam Kelly didn't play most of it.
That scheme continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos was saving from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score because of the Rangers' skill, Alan McGregor, and Litgo took the ball away from another liver action.
Livingston's sixteen-year-old was constantly passed and was constantly defended, while two demands for the penalty – after Halket's dispute over Glen Middleton's replacement and one for hand-playing – were rejected.
"Penomenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alaster Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni arena
Phenomenal game and result for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to surpass the expectations of this high road.
Their style and character of playing barely changed after they returned to the top, but much of the merit goes to Holt's for the way he galvanized the team from his coming.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Connor Goldson and Joe Voral ready.
The Rangers still lacked inspiration.
As good as ever under Gerard's leadership, they are now lagging behind the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once they managed to open the hosts – and it was a small announcement to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Colonya
There were smiles and blue sky on Sunday (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit to President Erdogan of Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They are worse because of problems involving human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for the Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to prevent the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also explained, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposition protestors depict the guest's division famous as a hero of some German Turks and criticised as an autocrat of others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker died in a car crash
A bicycle driver died after a car crash in London.
The crash took place near the crossroads of Besyud and Evelyn Streets, a large-scale traffic jam in Deptford, in the southeast of the city of about 10.15 BST.
The car driver stopped and got emergency help, but the man died at the accident site.
The crash occurred a few months after the death of another biker in a traffic accident on the Childers Street where the driver escaped, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
Metro police said officials work to identify the man and inform his family.
Roadblocks are set up and buses are redirected and drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six police officers injured in trouble
Six prison police officers were injured in an unrest in the male prison with a high level of security, said at the prison's office.
The riots erupted in HMP Long Martin in Worchester at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and still persist.
Specialists from the Tornado unit were brought to resolve the unrest, which includes eight prisoners and is confined to one wing.
Officers are being treated for minor injuries on the spot.
Prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel were instructed to deal with the current HMP Long Lartin incident.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend extra time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, public order and peace police were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (can be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely occurs to hit Arizona, but it is likely that it will happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert south-west region, risking sudden flooding.
The State Weather Station has already issued warnings of possible sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, all the way to south and east Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Suite Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move along a straight path through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Weather Station tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression of 200 miles [200 km] of Phoenix since 1950!
Katarina (1967) was a hurricane about 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models at the Hurricane State Centre provide for 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the work of the Arizona Mongolia.
Other areas of the desert south-west region, including the central parts of the Carpest Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated areas up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risk areas of sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to be beneficial because the southwestern region is hit by drought.
According to the US drought tracking authority, almost 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com said.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path led to earth's defences all over the Gulf of Mexico.
Rosa, still in the middle of a hurricane Sunday morning with winds of up to 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes in contact with cold water in the Pacific and decreases.
Therefore, rains are expected in Mexico with a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
The rains in parts of Mexico may be intense and present a significant risk of floods.
"There is expected rain from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwestern Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain," weather.com said.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border in early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and south Juta until late evening hours on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected of Rosa or her remains are the very abundant rains in Lower California, southwestern Sonora and the desert southwestern region of the United States," the Hurricane State Centre said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening floods and torrents of debris, as well as landslides in the mountain regions.
Midsummer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested suspected of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelior Terrace in Midsummer Norton around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
It's taken to the hospital and is in a "stable" state.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, said Avon and Sommerset police.
The police asked if anyone had cell phone footage from the case, to step up.
Trump said Kavano "has endured the greatest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"Voice for Judge Kavano is a vote to reject the most harsh and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a gathering in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavano "has endured the greatest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Cavano witnessed before the convention on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blassi Ford’s accusations that he had half attacked her several decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford testified to the hearing and her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "the Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Cavano that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Kavano is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a record of uninterrupted public service," he told the crowd in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Cavano's nomination as he spoke of the significance of the island's pre-election output.
"More than five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really fighting," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trump said the Democrats have a mission to "give resistance and prevent".
The first key vote for Cavano's nomination in the Senate is expected not later than Friday, the senior GOP leader said to CNN.
Hundreds of dead in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunamis, and the total number of victims is increasing
At least 384 people died, many were taken away from the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of 6 feet (18 feet) hit the shore of the sunset, bringing many to death safely and ruining everything on their way.
After the 7.5 earthquake hit the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still doing their beach activities and didn't run away immediately, so they became victims," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, BNPB's spokesman for mediation in Indonesia's emergency briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, pulled cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the crash agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, torn and destroyed bridges and a water - surrounded mosque.
The subsequent tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
The earthquake series was affected by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said that energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than energy released from the atomic bomb in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of the long, narrow shore, can be enhanced by the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "abundant" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
Some victims' bodies were found trapped under the debris of ruined buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said victims and damage could be increased by 300 km (190 miles) north of Palo, in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their personnel and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing us that the tsunami hit Palou, although the authorities said the waves came at about the same time as the warning was issued.
In an amateur photo shared by social media, a man on the upper floors of the building can be heard shouting out loud, warning people down the street about the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall is stuck on the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't confirm the video right away.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a power interruption that cut off communications around Palo, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated people still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened only for help and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo had planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palou on Sunday.
The total number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees were sheltered in shelters of corn in the yard of their office, they walked through the scenes of the wilderness, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even as relief groups began their dark attempts to start disaster relief, some complained that foreign aid experts had been prevented from travelling to Palo.
Under Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and foreign personnel can only begin to come if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian red cross.
"As the government will say, 'All right, this is a national disaster', we can receive international aid, but there is still no status.
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palou fell on Friday, friends and families of the disappeared were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would facilitate the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers rescued a woman who was trapped under the boot for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian state team for paraglodyry, trained two of the missing paraglodiers for Asian games, which ended at the beginning of the month in Indonesia.
The others who were stuck in Roa Roa Hotel, added Mr. Mandaggi, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paralysis, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon told how, when she began to circulate news about the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel in the community of paragloderists, he was desperate to send messages to whatsApp to the competitors from Palo, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray sign of cycling, rather than with a son.
"I think that means the messages are not delivered," he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 when they filled out the ATM at "Newport on Cay."
Thieves stole 26,750 dollars from a staff member in Brink's on Friday, who added a ATM to Newport's, according to a press release at Newport's police station.
The car driver celebrated the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to supplement it with money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money intended to deliver.
The Witnesses noticed more suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, according to the statement, but the police did not give a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: Rapper changed his name in Ye
Rapper Kane West has changed his name to Yah.
The change published on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "The universe was once known as the Kanje West."
Forty-one year-old West wore her pasture for a while and took advantage of the passage for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change happened just before his Saturday Night Live guest, where he is expected to publish his new "Yandhi" album.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande on the show that had to give up "emotive reasons," the show's creator said.
Although he uses it as a shortcut to his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ey' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means 'you'," West said at the beginning of this year, discussing the title of his album with the editor Big Boy.
"What do you mean I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
He left Canaan, which means the only one, to Him alone, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a show of who we are."
He's one of the many known rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Paf Grandpa, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love (Love and Brother Love).
Former West co-worker, Jay Zee, also uses his name with or without drawing and all the big letters.
AMLO from Mexico promises not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military force against civilians while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolko Plaza that "he will never use the Mexican people's army for repression".
The military shot peaceful demonstrators at the square on October 2, 1968, killing even 300 people at the time the left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly assistance to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said the unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attracted young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research resources in the field, the investor and practitioner told AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after different parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. has no formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be number 1 in innovations for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Integrating the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far away from the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Li said.
The duplication of funds can double the chances that the next major achievement in the area of AI will make the United States, Li said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published a month ago by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Director General of Synovation Ventures, who invests in one of the most outstanding AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 80s of Carnegie Melon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that won the highest-ranked American suit player, and later he was director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's border in China.
They thanked them for previous U.S. government technology competitions as the challenge of the Agency's robotics for advanced defence research projects and asked when the next competition would be, in order to help identify the following visionaries.
U.S. researchers often need to work hard to get state grants, Li said.
"It's not China that took academic leaders, it's corporations," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university experts to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors of sciences by artificial intelligence," he said.
China's State Council issued its Plan for the Development of the Future Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences finances people in academic institutions similar to the way the Natural Science and Other Government Organisation Foundation distributes money to researchers from the United States, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which should include partners from industry and the academy, and the White House announced the establishment of the Official Intelligence Committee.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion for the initiative called "AI Next".
As for the NSF, more than $100 million is currently invested annually in researching artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for the establishment of the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence had no effect for months.
Macedonians vote on a referendum on whether to change the country's name
People in Macedonia voted on a Sunday referendum to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked its EU and NATO membership demands.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name is a right to its territory and places a veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Djirge Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum and the boycotting campaign doubted whether the outcome would meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum's validity.
The question of the referendum card was: "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth paying to allow for the entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the country's future, for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje said.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority is needed to change the name in parliament.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the outcome was 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters gave their vote.
"I went out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," 62-year-old Giuseppe Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje, said.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko gave their vote at a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, opening the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Stromica.
Before the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small scene and chairs in front of tents set by people who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads raised high, not from the back entrance," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will be because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said the result "yes" would be "confirmed for our future".
The poll, announced last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Political Research, showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is under the required background.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent will vote with yes.
To succeed in the referendum, the output should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious impact on the policy of the pro-Western government after they came to power in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passed the entire Bryton defense of goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly conquered Bryton's defence in the 2 - 0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihhad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentinan attacker received an average delivery on the field at the beginning of the sequence.
It quickly passed between three Bryton defence players before entering the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four greens.
He circled around a defensive player before running a few others on the sixties of Brighton's.
He then left him on Sterling.
The English attacker took advantage of his first arrival to the sixteenth to return the ball to Aguero, who with his right leg beat Bryton's Gollman, Matthew Ryan, with a single strike on the right side of the network.
"Aguero has leg problems," City Manager Pep Gardiola told reporters.
“We were talking about playing 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky you gave a shot at that moment."
But the initial advantage of the "heavenly blues" gave Sterling in the fight for the Prime Minister's League.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a long ball in Bryton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Lyroy Shane.
Shane touched her a few times before taking Sterling to the remote article.
The attack of "heavenly blues" put the ball in the net before it went out in the car.
City will fight Hoffenheim at the Champions League team at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhine-Necar Arena, Germany.
Shercer wants to play a spore against Rockys.
Since Nashnells was eliminated from the game fight, there was no reason to force another start.
But always competitive Shercer hopes to stand in the central square Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there's still a playoff for the Rockis team, who run a game in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rockis' team had at least a "joker" for a place with a victory from 5 to 2 over Nashnells on Friday night, but they are still struggling to establish their place in the first division.
"Although we don't play for nothing, at least we can throw it out knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any moment I'm going to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nashnells still needs to publish a starter for a week, but he is reportedly inclined to let Shercer drop into such a situation.
Shercer, who will start after 34th time, trained tossing on Thursday and usually throws a rest on Sunday.
Washington's right is 18 – 7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 square-points in 220 2/3 inches this season.
Trump's Day in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation about Brett Cavano's election to the Supreme Court as he spoke about the importance of the output of the Republicans of the early elections.
"All we've done so far will be put on a cube in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big – I don't run, but I really fight, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump went on, "You see these horrible, horrible groups of democracies, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all their resources available to them, you see evil, impudence.
They don't care who they're going to hurt, when they're supposed to cross in order to get power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "give resistance and prevent".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "stricken, evil, worthless and false".
He mentioned Senator Diana Finstein of the ranks of the Democrats, set up by the Senate's Judicial Committee, on behalf of which the public reacted with appeals for disillusionment.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, I wait a little – it was a very bad speech on the body – the worst speech on the body I've ever seen."
The labs no longer accept different opinions.
People who express their opinion are not tolerated
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was almost not a surprise.
However, I am only the last in the ranks of members of parliament from the labyristic party to whom it was said that we are not welcome – just because he expresses his opinion.
My colleague-parliamentary Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he took a decisive stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of an East Labor Party meeting in Nottingam stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the labyrinth Party, the council meetings on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of most meetings, but the promise of a "serious, humble" policy has long been forgotten if it has indeed started.
It becomes increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the labyristic party, and each opinion is ruled out as acceptable to the party’s leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when the colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect to completely change my thinking and take positions that otherwise would never take them, whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
Whenever I speak in public, and it really doesn't matter what I'm going to say, there's a critical abuse of the social media that calls for conviction, a rejection of the policies of the centre, telling me I shouldn't be in the labyrinth party.
And I'm not the only one with such experience.
Actually, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed to me are usually political.
I have a great sense of professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist abuses every day, but they never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how abuse levels have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the lab party should practice tolerance culture.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every demand for "no confidence" or change of selection rules, the party becomes more narrow.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years, telling me to keep my head down, not be so loud and then "all will be fine".
But that's not why I came into politics.
Even 32 years ago, when I joined the Labour Party as a student, provoked by the concerns of the Tacher government that literally left my school to collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those who were most in need, whether as a local adviser or a government minister.
I never hid my policy, including the last elections.
No one in East Notingham could be confused in any way about my political positions and areas of conflict with current leadership.
To those who supported Friday’s request, all I want to say is that when the country goes to Bregzit to harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy on loyalty to the leader of the labyrinth.
But I have a message not for Notingam Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members of the lab party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how condemnational threats or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will distract me from acting in the way I think it is in the best interest of all of you.

The two late points may have changed the final result some time ago, but there is no doubt that Ear earned the triumph in this wonderful fun competition on the day of the Scottish Prefecture in rabbi.
They are now at the top of the table, the only unwined side of the ten.
In the end, everything is due to their superior defenses, as well as to their improved chances of being used by the home team, and coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested through our competitions so far and we are still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said: “The fire for Air has made better use of their chances than we have. ”
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave Air an advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, given for the Voirers' game, enabled Melrose to improve his numbers, and Jason Bagot picked up an unconverted point.
Klimo delayed the lead of Ear with a pen, earlier, exactly in half time, and reached a point, converting the salt point to reach Ear with 17 - 5 in the rescue.
But Melrose well started the second half, and Patrick Anderson's point, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruarid Nott, who was carried on the wearer, and from the beginning, Ear continued to struggle with the point of Stafford McDoval, converted by Climo.
Earl's CEO, Blair McFerson, then got a yellow cardboard and again, Melrose paid for the additional man with an unconverted point on Bruce Colvin at the end of the time with unforgivable pressure.
But the home team is back, and when Stroan Hackinson gets a yellow box to beat Klimo without the ball, McFerson wins a taxduan from the line of bars on the back of the sharp attack on Air.
Climo was converting, as he did almost again from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's shot and sent the winged player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
The Still Game star looks ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The Still Game star, Ford Kiran, seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after it has been found to be appointed director of a licensed company restaurant.
Fifty-six-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the BBC's popular series, on which he is a screenwriter and plays together with the longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemfil.
Duoto announced that the next ninth season would be the last and seems to be Kirnan planning for life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is director of Agergingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun's source said that Kirnan is trying to engage in the "successful restaurant trade" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia surrounded by land hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a covered-laundered Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings set up a sea blue flag.
The seabeds from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are filled with the motto: “The sea is ours with justice.
It's our duty to return."
Along the land of Bolivia, the mention of the shore lost for Chile in the bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still fresh, as is the desire to sail back to the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be the greatest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive outcome is expected," said Roberto Kalsadija, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the international court's decision on large screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will judge in favour of Bolivia's prosecution, which, after decades of changing talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant a sovereign exit to Bolivia's sea.
Here's Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president of native origin, facing a controversial fight for re-elections next year, also depends heavily on the verdict on Monday.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific," he celebrated at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not judge for Bolivia and that it will not change much even for them.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chile's territory and has indicated that it will not decide on the outcome of the possible talks.
The fact that the judgement of the international court comes only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zarate, an expert on international law from Chile.
And for the last four years, they may have been behind Bolivia's cause instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has taken advantage of the problem of accessing the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining good will, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to speak, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that making a court decision is unusually fast.
Monday would bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disunity with mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadija also rejected the fact that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the problem with the sea as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says it won't come to nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the U.S.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made at the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the task of restoring blocked nuclear diplomacy for more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Young Un.
Ri says it's a "fiction" to be considered that the continued sanctions and US protests for the declared completion of the Korean war will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang to take significant disarmament measures first.
And Kim and the president of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about quitting the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim Tramp's second summit.
Paris' fashion reviews reveal the latest line of massive hats that is on the way to the biggest shops near you
If you want to improve the size of your collection gates or completely block the sun, then don't go on looking.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of deranged hats for their SS19 collection on the track that blinded the style set on the Modern Week in Paris.
Finally, unpracticed hats launched Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their creations that fall into the eye on the track.
The piece that was highlighted by Valentino was a huge coat of hat decorated with a wide range of feathers that flooded the head of the model.
The other major additions included citricians, magic hats, even pineapples, but they are not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for the Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had shoddy lips and looked more like Hannibal Reader than in high fashion.
One creation looked like a full-fledged drill with glasses and a tube for a drill, and the other looked like a hot corn ice cream.
And if you're continuing with a huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Followers of style predict that huge hats can come to the stores near you.
The big hats came very quickly after La Bomba, the straw hat with both wide two steps that all carry from Riana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult fashion house behind too much unpractice hat spread through social media sent another great creation on the track, a slender beach bag of almost the same size as the height of the model it drew.
The dark orange ruffie bag, with a raffie edge and with a white leather handle, was the piece highlighted in the La Riviera SS19 collection of the Modern Week in Paris.
The stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer, because the designer caused so much impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many supplements."
John Edward: Language skills are needed for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continues in 2018 with another comprehensive excellent results of the trials, which only reinforces with individual and group success in the community's sport, art, music and other achievements.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement custom school programs, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable as an object of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “Speaking to a man in a language he understands will make him wise.
If you speak to him in his language, it will strike him in the soul."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Of the recent results of this year’s studies, we can note that the languages surpass all other subjects with the highest percentage of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved a higher score of "5+".
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students reached a higher score of "5+" in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students also reached "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly gain in the future.
Languages now, as an object of choice, are seen at the same level as STEM objects (studies, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
The UK Employment and Skills Commission survey in 2014 noted that due to employers' failure to fill jobs, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs in demand of languages, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a life - style.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give priority to the policy before competition.
According to a YouTube survey of over 4,000 adults from the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language spoken over ten percent, that is 15 percent of people.
So investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to its language.
Several schools will focus on the classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in the OK when it comes to the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there will always be a number of languages from which you can choose in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing the learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed for success, regardless of what the future may bring.
At the moment, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital for the country's future, so this must be changed to schools.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
"It must be done well".
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron will lead Lakers to debit in San Diego on Sunday.
Waiting's almost over for fans who wanted to see Lebron James start up for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach, Luke Walton, announced James will be playing the first game in the pre-season week against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But for the next few minutes, it's still not decided.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudel, wrote a tweet that James would probably play a limited time.
At the beginning of the week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game season before the Lakers season.
"I don't need games in the preseason at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
YouTube channel for Trump's meeting in West Virginia
President Donald Trump started a series of meetings as part of the campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It's the first of the five Trump's scheduled meetings next week, including visits to popular places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his election to fill the empty space in the Supreme Court is in rest, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, because the Republicans can lose control in Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump's evening meeting in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 afternoons. Eastern coast time zone tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia via a live YouTube broadcast.
This week it is likely that Trump will address the hearing of the man nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, who has become tense because of the allegations of sexual misconduct with the expected postponement of the Senate vote until one week, while the FBI's investigation is ongoing.
The primary objective of the series of meetings is to help the Republicans get a turn for the November elections .
From this point on, President Trump's campaign said these five-minutes next week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Conference control is so important in his agenda that the president will travel in as many allied states as possible with the start of the campaign effort season," Trump's campaign spokesman for Reuters, who refused to be appointed, said.
As scheduled in the Wesbanko arena in Willing, tonight's meeting can attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media, according to the West Virginia Metro news.
On Saturday is the second trip to Trump in West Virginia in the last month, a country in which he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It's not good for Morrisey that the president has to come to improve the popularity of polls," said Simon Hyder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: US team showed courage in the fight to keep the hopes alive at the beginning of the individual competitions on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the four on Saturday afternoon might have been exactly what he needed at Cupot Ryder.
The turnaround of happiness is a completely invented sport concept, but players really believe in it, and most of these games.
To whom would you say happiness is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so we're a little lucky," Jordan Spit said after the end of today's competition.
Europeans have an advantage of, of course, a lead of four points and twelve more games.
According to Spy, Americans feel that they have a weak wind in the head even though they have enough incentives, if nothing else is the shape of Spy and Justin Thomas playing together all day and each has reached three points of four.
Spy was excellent and led by example.
Those strong demands for celebration became ever stronger during his game, with a key blow that led to the reconciliation of four-four when he and Thomas had two failures after two rounds.
His strike with which they won the 15th was over with a similar call, as he tells you he believes the American team is not out of the game.
"You just have to get deeper and take care of your game," Spit said.
That's all that's left of every player now.
18 holes to reach a point.
The only players with more points from Spy and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed story of Cupot Ryder.
The strange but wonderful duo in Europe is four out of four and they can't be wrong.
Molivud was the only pair without bad hits on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad hits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players that will win Sunday and that there will be no other popular players that will provide a potential European victory when the sun goes behind Le Golf Nazional, except for Flitwood or Molinari.
She prefers the two at the same time on different holes.
However, talks about European glory remain unwarranted.
Bubba Watson and Web Samson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of two couples, when he joined Alex Norren.
A missed blow and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Swedes in a hole from which they never got out.
Sunday, however, there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The two couples and the four are so fascinating to view closely because of the interaction between their partners, the advice they give, the advice they fail to listen to, and the way the strategy can change at once.
Europeans played better as a team and with that they made a significant lead in the last day, but the four-year season also showed that the US team could fight even though some, especially Americans, were suspicious.
Europeans led with 10-6 in the last day of Cupot Ryder
Europe will take a solid lead in the last day of Cupot Ryder after Saturday's leadership in double pairs and four from 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired Duo Tommy Flitwood and Francisko Molinari led the two-victim attack while Tiger Woods was struggling to take the lead so far to Le Golf Nazional at four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who fought to keep the trophy lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team that had many failures in the morning double pairs and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans gave more resistance to the four, winning two matches, but they could not reach the leadership.
Jim Furick’s team needs eight out of 12 individual games a week to hold the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European beginner to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, called "Molywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in the first four competitions in the history of Cupot Ryder.
After "sucking" Woods and Patrick Reed in double pairs, they played great and beat exorbitant Woods and American beginner Bryson Deshambu with an even more pronounced result of 5&4.
Woods, who went through two swords on Saturday, played great at moments, but now lost 19 of the 29 matches in double pairs and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, resting as the morning doubles lasted, returned as Henry Stanson's partner to the four with a 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the world's first and third rankings.
However, Europeans were not all after them that pleasant, windy day south-west of Paris.
The three-time dominant winners Jordan Spy and Justin Thomas have put in place a two-point measure for Americans on Saturday.
They won a decisive 2&1 victory over the Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Puller in the doubles and returned later to win Pulter and Rory McClroy with 4&3 in fours, but lost at the initials, two holes.
Only two times in the history of Cupot Ryder a certain team has recovered from the lack of four points in an individual game, although as bearers of the title, Furik's team had enough uniform results to keep the trophy.
After two days, however, the Sunday attack seems to remain over them.
North Korea says "no way" to unarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions are increasing mistrust in the United States and that the country has no chance of giving up nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Body that North Korea took "significant measures of good will" last year, such as stopping nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing itself to proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see a proper response from the United States." he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no way to unify ourselves for the first time."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to the accession to nuclear disarmament "in the phase", according to which North Korea would be progressively rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilaterally, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit to the current US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea demands a formal end to the Korean war from 1950-53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first abandon the nuclear weapon.
Washington also refuses to give up strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "nuclear disarmament above all" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes "the declaration of the end of the war," Rí said.
"The perception that sanctions can bend us on our knees is a crazy dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the existing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other side of this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not end in such a scarshock."
However, Ri's tone of speech was significantly different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of North Korean missiles to American land is inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a rocket" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who was threatened last year with the "complete destruction" of North Korea, was greatly grateful to Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that there was much work to be done and that sanctions must remain until the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying "Is it necessary for two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompey told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council's sanctions must continue fully and without exception until fully, finally, nuclear disarmament is confirmed."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to prevent the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time it didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress was made, but was denied by North Korea only after a few hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea is committed to a meeting with Moon this month for the disarmament of a missile facility, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "adequate measures" he was looking for are the security guarantees Trump gave in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students visit courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates more to sleep in order to fight the growing macho culture of learning by staying awake all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often know nothing when it comes to basic care for themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Women's Hospital in Brigam, has designed the course he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the influence of insufficient sleep on learning.
"At the end of the lecture, a girl came and said to me, "Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?"
She said no one, never told her the importance of sleeping - what surprised me," he said about the Telegraph.
The course that was offered for the first time this year explains to students how good sleep habits help in academic and athletic outcomes and improve the general well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding out that students have a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The same course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a student’s home where students press for coffee glasses, curtains, patches, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insufficient sleep affects athletic performances and the importance of the routine of going to bed.
In another part, participants learn how a long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart and brain attacks, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette," added Professor Chazler.
The culture of pride with "work all night" still exists, he said, and moreover modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that the lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Having enough sleep, with good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" in the fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid fatting, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to go into hunger, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Saw, a 19-year-old student from California in chemistry and physics, helped Professor Chazler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act on the course throughout the student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduates to complete a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chazler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when they go to bed, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which shifts the circular rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's head gathered Gerard's men
Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's strike sent Stephen Gerard's rascal team to the 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to register its first victory after the 4-1 February triumph in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team put down the second defeat of Gerard's team in 18 games as a manager who left his team with eight points behind the running lead team Harts in the Scottish first league.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and Rangers' setup lost inspiration and chances of reconciliation.
Now the Rangers have fallen to the sixth place, and Livingston's up to the third, and they're just behind the Hibernian according to the difference in the head.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers after line judge Kalum Spence had to receive medical attention due to head injury after he was obviously hit with an object from a distance.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that passed Air in the semifinal of Cupot Bethfred.
Holt, on the other hand, was playing with the same 11 of Livingston who won the match with Harts last week and would be happy in the way his well-trained position held the opponents at every chance.
Rangers may have dominated possession over the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
It was supposed to be a point, two minutes after the beginning when Menga's first play turned Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the middle-class player missed the chance.
Then a blow from the distance of Kehan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgou could only play openly in the defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but it seemed that there was more hope than faith in their last-third game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should get a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he and Steven Loules clashed, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not give a sign of approval of the Colombian complaint.
Rangers managed to reach only two shots to the goal in the first half, but Ibrax Liam Kelly's former goalman didn't get away with the blow with Lasana Kulibali's head and Ovi Edaria's weak blow.
Although the start of the 34th minute of Livingston may have been contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved their game.
Again, Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' strike.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who with a cold head chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the half-time when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a rapid impact when the wing player passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his block line.
But Livingston managed to attract the host players to play the type of game they enjoy, while Litgou and Hackett caught a lot of the long addenda.
Holt's team could have extended the lead to the end of the game, but McGregor was well placed and stopped Jacobs from playing with his head on the corner before Litgou.
Raingers' replacement, Glen Middleton, had another request for a penalty after he broke up with Jacobs, but Thompson refused again.
Almanah: Gieger's counter inventor
And now one side of our German "In the Week of the Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE'VE DESIGNED ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Gieger was born in Germany.
Gieger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of a device known as a gieger numerator.
Since then it has become the main focus of science, the gyger's numerator has become the main focus of popular culture, such as in the 1950 movie "The Forest of Colorado", in which these seemingly incredible, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that again?"
Rogers: “It’s a gyger numerator, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that release the radioactivity into the minerals."
Evans: "Say it, it's probably jumping now!"
Hans Gieger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" alien cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "look at" alien cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize alien cells as part of the treatment
Method includes the extraction of patient immune cells and their laboratory changes
You can "see" protein honor in many types of cancer, and then be returned to the organism.
The test vaccine provides promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize alien cells, the cancer of the ovaries disappeared in 18 months.
The method includes extraction of immunological cells from the patient, their changes in the laboratory, so that they can "see" protein honor in many types of cancer called HER2, and then their return to the organism.
Professor Jay Berzofski, from the American National Cancer Institute of Betezah, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast cancer, eurauria, white lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach with withdrawal of immunological cells from patients and their "learning" as to target cancer cells works when treating certain types of leukaemia.
Kanje West made a pro-Tramp exit, wearing a drop with his motto, after a performance Saturday night live.
That didn't go well.
Kanje West was noted in the studio during a live show on Saturday night, after a useless performance that US President Donald Trump was missing and said he would run for a function in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called the City of Ghosts, where he wore a cap with a inscription to make America Slavna Again, he began criticizing the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Frequently when I talk to a white man, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism I would have moved away from America long ago," he said.
The Saturday evening live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Cavano's testimony to the Senate's Legal Affairs Commission, in connection with the charges of a sexual assault by Christine Blake Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of West's fall was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to laugh at West with the announcement.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had a hard time going behind the scene because of his cap.
"The back of the scene was laughing at me.
They said, "Don't show up with that drop."
They made fun of me!
Then they told me I was in the basement, he said, according to Washington Exzeminer.
The West continued: "Do you want to see the bottom?" said he would "put on his superman hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love."
His comments attracted riots from the audience at least twice, and the evening show's team seemed embarrassed, reports Varajeti, a man said to the publisher: "The whole studio is taking care of."
West was brought as a last-minute replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
The West surprised many with the performance of the song "I love it," dressed as a bottle of Perier.
West received support from the TPSAD Conservative Group leader, Candis Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits: I thanked you for the development of the crowd".
But the host of Karen Hunter's show wrote on Twitter that West was "its own and that's absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") whom I believe is accepting and spreading ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now "formally known as Caine West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Didi's steps, known as Paf Grandpa, Paf and P Didi.
Comrade rapper, Snoop Dog has the name Snoop Lyon, and of course the lost musical legend Prince, changed his name into a symbol, and then into an artist from a previously known Prince.
Charge for attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after he kicked a man into a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Balihakmore, the police said.
The accused is expected to appear before the Supreme Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the public prosecutor.
The Star of the Thrones Game Series, Keith Harrington, attacked the toxic male
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled matchmaker like John Snow in a violent, medieval, fantastic series of Thrones Games.
But actor 31, attacked the macho-hero stereotype, when he said such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be strong to be respected.
In a statement on Sandai Times' culture, Keith said he believed that "something is wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the age of #SegaQajam.
Kit, who recently married the Thrones Game star, Rosie Leslie, also 31 admitted that she had "strong feelings" after that question.
"I personally have strong feelings, at the moment - where did we make a mistake with the male?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxicity, thanks to strong male figures.
He continued: “What is born again, and what is taught?
What does TV teach, and what on the street, make young boys feel they have to have a certain side of the male?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change it?
'Cause it's obvious something's wrong with young men."
In an interview he also admitted that he would not participate in the continuation of the Thrones Game when the series will end next summer, saying "end with battles and horses".
As of November, Keith will be taking place in the renewal of the Real West of Sam Shepard, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently found out that he thinks that what he met Rose's wife is the best thing that came out of the Throne Game.
"I met my wife in this series, so she gave me the future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose was playing Game, a character who had a loving appeal to Keith's character, John Snow, in the fantastic series that won Amy's awards.
The couple were married in June 2018 to the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% leap in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are occupied in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new events were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of transfusion with infected blood.
But the number of people suffering from HIV in this way is reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in the province of Yunan.
For a year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT people is great.
Because of the country's conservative values, surveys show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inappropriate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxin Waters denied the data submitted by a member of staff associated with the Republican Party's senator as "dangerous lies" and "consent theories"
US Representative Maxine Waters dismissed the charges on Saturday that a member of her staff had published personal information to three republican senators in the United States of Wikipedia's legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles believed that claims were on "ultra-right" sympathies and web sites.
"Flags, lies and even disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes home address and phone numbers of US Senator Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hech from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill while the Senate panel was conducting a hearing on allegations of sexual behaviour against Bret Cavano, nominated as a judge of the Supreme Court.
The information provided appeared shortly after Cavano's interrogation by three senators.
Conservation sites such as Gateway Pandit and Redstead have announced that the IP address that identifies the source of the announcement is linked to the Waters office and published information on a Waters staff member, Hill said.
"These unfortunate charges are completely false and constitute an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of those false and false accusations -- is in no way responsible for the information that has been submitted.
Unlucky charges are completely false and are absolutely a lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted internet criticism, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Flasher.
"These denials are nervous," Flysher wrote.
"This shows that it has no temperature to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
It must not be challenged.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher seems to have compared Waters' reaction to the criticisms of the Democrats related to Judge Kavano, who was accused by critics because he seemed too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navaro, a Republican candidate who is running to replace Waters in the mid-term elections, also announced on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement Waters said her office informed "the relevant institutions and police about false claims.
"We will allow the offenders to be found," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions which are harmful and dangerous to some and all my staff members".
The idea of Johnny English Attacks Again - undermined Rowan Atkinson's spy frauds
It is now traditional to look for Bregzit's elements in every new British-related movie, which also seems to be valid for this refurbishment of the falsified, action comedy Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was reborn in 2011 with Johnny English: again.
Will the careful self - ridicule on the subject of how clearly we are nowhere be the new opportunity for the export that the nation has?
In spite of all this, the face with big eyes and a lot of grins of the uncompetent Johnny English has been given a license to "stop" things the second time - his name above all means that he is a comical creation with a wide range, made for viewers in cinemas in places where no English is spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who despite his bizarre efforts for a careful glamour somewhat like Cluzo, has drawings of Mr. Bin and a part of the boy playing a note from the Song of the Horse at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Its foundation is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in Barclay's forgotten TV commercial, leaving himself in chaos.
There's one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I liked it very much when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotor's feathers hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for a physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially because "serious" film brands like 007 and Impossible Mission and themselves contain comedy elements.
The humor seems to be intended for children, rather than for adults, and for me, Johnny English's messy accidents aren't as inventive and focused as the neems of Bin's Atkinson's character.
The theme that has been going on all the time is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker infiltrated the super secret network of spies in Britain, discovering the identities of all British field agents, to disappoint the agent who is in office - a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance of a prime minister who is a brave and fighting figure and already suffers from a full melt of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives himself in this figure of Quazi-Teresa-May, but there is nothing special in the scenario that would work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling himself Johnny English, who now works as a private school teacher, but "black" gives classes for secret agents: there are a few good boys here, when English offers a school of spying that looks like a rock academy.
English is soon invited to the Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former co-worker Bow, who plays Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, about a commandant of a submarine, a comical role that Vicky Pepperdin has not been well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for messing up all the things in the Royal Secret Service, they go back to action and meet the beautiful Ofelia Bouletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Walta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their assessment of absurd actions: processed as waiters they light up a French restaurant; make a desert after they cross the luxury yacht of Volta; and English starts right anarchy when trying to use the helmet for virtual reality to familiarize themselves with the interior of the Volta house.
All the brakes are removed for the last sequence, but as kind and loud as it is, there's a lot of children's TV in the entire movie.
Nice moderate stuff.
And as with the other movies with Johnny English, I can't but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that will use his talent?
Laburists refuse to plan for British work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party will consider a radical plan that British will work four days a week - but will be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company's bosses to use the safeguards they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would take the same salary.
According to sources, the idea "records" with the party's economic agenda and with the country's plans to be more inclined to workers.
The four-day shift is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to have gains from economic changes.
A high - ranking member of the party said of Sandy Times: “The revision of the strategy should be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a work week of four days is a pursuit that is consistent with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party was betting for a four-day work week during the 2017 parliamentary elections campaign.
However, the aspiration is not accepted by the whole Laburist party.
Labourist Party Portal said: "The four-day work week is not a party strategy and the party does not consider such an idea."
The shadow Chancellor John McDonald used the Laburists' conference last week to present his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to seize the power of "personless directors" and "professors" in municipal companies.
The plans of the shadow office also mean that current water supply companies shareholders may not get the whole part back because the Laburist government could make "deductions" for non-ethical behaviour.
He also confirmed the plans for workers to become part of the company's boards and to create an inclusive property fund with which 10 percent of private companies' capital will belong to employees, which could take an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy is making a statement about "60 minuti" whether the FBI's investigation into Cavano can change them.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavano postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and updated the question of whether the discovery of the bureau could rethink some republican senators to withdraw the support.
In an interview published on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minit" Scott Pelly asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them think.
Kennedy was more open than his college in South Carolina.
"I think so," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, determined, unquestionable."
The voice of Graham, however, seems to be carved into stone.
"My decision was made for Bret Cavano and a shocking indictment is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett was energetically denying it," Graham added, thinking of Christine Blake Ford.
"Everyone she calls could not confirm.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held at the Global Citizens' Festival, an annual music event with famous stars and an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizens festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will come to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (except if they do not want to pay for the VIP ticket), participants need to fulfill several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, phone call or other useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the Golbalian citizen because it's 12 years left to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to ask for something or just another case of "click-activism" -- people who feel they make a real difference by signing a petition on the Internet or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have claimed to have registered more than 19 million "activities" of supporters, which have acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitment and strategies that have gathered more than $37 billion and that will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and announcements resulting from their activities, of which 10 billion dollars have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Food, an investor-implementation partnership, with a seat in Britain dedicated to "helping children take advantage of their potential", which promises to provide $35 million for Rwanda to help with food shortages in the country after receiving 4,700 messages from Twitter from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and the Global Citizens as well as you, we can do the social injustice of insecurity, a note in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Power of Food said, in front of the assembled people at the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities were undertaken in connection with calls to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, the Power of Iskranta, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
As an answer to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, "Why do you think you can put an end to extreme poverty?"
From Global Citizens, they replied: “It will be a long and difficult path — we will never succeed.
But like the big citizens and anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we'll succeed, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardy B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists that will take place at this year's New York event, whose host will be Deborah-Li Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russian exports of energy - Ministry of Interior
Washington can "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, has discovered US Interior Minister Ryan Zinky, as Washington Exeminer quoted.
According to Zinky, Russia's involvement in Syria -- in particular, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government -- is being set aside to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of the energy market, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the government representative, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea routes remain open and if blocks are needed to prevent their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki is addressing the events organised by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit group that represents itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it is effective.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the stake and replacing the fuel," he said, while speaking of Russia as "one unpleasant pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement followed after Trump's administration launched a mission to encourage exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" North Tek 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made from Berlin a "prison" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Tek 2 pipeline, which is worth 11 billion dollars, should double the current capacity of the 110 billion cubic metres pipeline, is just an economic project.
Kremlin claims that the strong opposition of Washington to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that customers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position found opposition from Germany, confirming its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation in Germany, the German Industry Federation (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere with European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kemf, the first man of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin said.
Elizabeth Warren "will consider carefully" whether to run for president in 2020, Senator of Massachusetts said
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she "will carefully consider" whether to run for president after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting in the city congregation in Holioc, Massacusec, Warren confirmed that he was thinking about running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our non-functional government, which means a woman on the forehead," she said, according to Hill.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider whether to run for president."
Warren assessed President Donald Trump's work during the meeting in the city hall and said he "guided the country in the wrong direction.
"I am too concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is open in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominated as a judge at the Supreme Court, Bret Cavano.
In a message to Twitter Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her election unit think it should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" Massac voters said the senator should not be running, according to a study by the Center for Political Research at the University of Safolk/Bostonski Globus.
Thirty-two percent support such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting potential nominations, and 48 percent opposed.
Other well-known names from the democratic party about the nomination in 2020 are former vice president Joe Byden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he would officially decide by January, according to Associated Press.
Sara Peylin talks about Trek Peylin's post-traumatic syndrome at Donald Trump's meeting.
Trek Peylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after reporting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"As my son passes through, as he passes through after he has returned, I know how the other families are feeling torn apart because of the post-straumatic syndrome and the wounds our soldiers are returning with," she said before the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pielin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other military veterans "are returning a little different, they return firmly, they return and wonder if there is respect for what they and their friends of the air force have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska and accused of domestic violence with a female attack, along with a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennet, a police spokesman in Vasil.
18 United States and Washington City Supports the Controversy of New Asylum Policy
Eighteen allied states and Washington are supporting the opposition to the new US policy that prevents the granting of asylum to victims who flee from domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 EU states and the city of Washington filed a petition to the court (amicus curiae) on Friday in Washington as support to an asylum-seeker who contests politics, En-Bi-Ci News said.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace case against Parliament, which the American Union for Civil Liberties filed in August against federal policy, has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang," abused her, but the US authorities rejected her request for asylum on July 20th.
She was locked up in Texas.
The state defender, whom Grace represents, described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which many of the demands for asylum in the United States have been raised as nations with persistent gang and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annuls the 2014 Board's decision on immigration complaints, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The city's public defender of Washington Carl Rasin said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of bringing laws at the level of the states, federal and international levels".
"The federal law requires all asylum requirements to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such a provision violates that principle," according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, the defenders in the letter claim that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering is harmful to the US economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary labour force".
Public defender Jeff Sessens ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is asylum for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion," Seshns said in presenting policy on 11 June.
Asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
A desperate rescue effort is being made in Palou because the number of victims doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while comforting her male baby in an evacuation centre in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
The residents return to their ruined homes and choose from their cited items in order to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has broken back and shoulder, rest in front of the War Hospital in Palou, where patients were treated outside because of frequent minor earthquakes.
Salsy found it in his eyes when he described the severe earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I was pressed in the urinates of the wall, so I think," Harris said about Assisied Press, adding that his family was in town for wedding.
"I heard the wife ask for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "distorting" with "propaganda"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-party advertisement in a US daily newspaper counting the mutual benefit of trade between the US and China, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using US media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about China Daily's pay addendum in De Moin Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of getting involved in the US elections on 6 November, China rejected the indictment.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked next to US services for Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish marketing promotion ads, Beijing and Washington, they are currently in a trade war that balances import tariffs with each other.
China's revenge rates at the beginning of the trade war were directed towards exporters from allied countries such as Iowa, which support Trump's republican party, Chinese and US experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former, long-standing governor of Iowa, key exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing is hurting US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Brandad wrote in a column in De Moin Register's Sunday edition, "now doubles the abuse of propaganda advertising in our free press".
"After the decade of the propaganda, the Chinese government abuses the unscrupulous American tradition of free speech and free media by placing advertisements in De Moin Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the near newspaper stand, here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not see the true reflection of the desperate views that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic trajectory, because the media are controlled by the strong hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most widely read newspapers in China rejected his offer to publish" on the column, although he did not say which newspaper it is.
Republicans withdraw from women's voices before the mid-term elections, due to the debacle with Cavano, analysts warn
Since many Republicans do not observe or defend Brett Cavano's nomination in the Supreme Court despite several charges of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already stated that they want to continue to vote.
From such things there is no return," wrote Grant Richer, professor of political sciences at Maxwell University in Siracusa, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Richer said he suspected that the pressure on the FBI's investigation of Senator Jeff Flake (Republican of Arizona) would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," said Karin Jean-Pier, a senior adviser and national spokesperson of the Progressive Group MoveOn, on Friday, in front of Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called "Noemvri is coming!" in a protest in the Senate hall, when Republicans, who have control in the Legal Affairs Committee, decided to continue the nomination of Cavano, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blake Ford, Mick said.
"Enthusiasm and the motivation of the democracies will be high," said Stu Rotenberg, a non-party political analyst for the news site.
"People are already saying they're tall; that's right.
But they may be higher, especially among independent women's voters in the suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate were detailed, analysts suggest that there may be negative consequences if the Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a major mess for the Republican Party," said former President Michael Steel of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to En-Bi-Ci news.
"It's not just about voting in the commission or the last vote or whether Kavano will go to hearing, it's about how the Republicans dealt with this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps in the election of democracies, for the news channel.
Yet, the Americans are divided about whom to trust after the testimony of Ford and Cavano, although a larger number accept the first-mentioned side.
A new survey by Yu-Gov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe in Cavano.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Cavano probably or definitely lied when witnessing, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one more, on Debor Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senate's Legal Affairs Commission, under oath last week that Cavano attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez charges that the judge in the Supreme Court showed her genitals at a party, as they studied at Jeil in the 1980 ’ s.
World Network Designer plans to start a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Li, the inventor of the World Network starts with a start-up business that claims to be a rival of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in technology, Inrapt, is a company that is built on the open-source platform of Solid, Berners-Li.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Companies, Berners-Li joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up business.
"Now is the historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own internet data storage or a reduced POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, mailing lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outluck, Sleak and Spotifay all available to a browser at the same time.
What's unique about the personal internet data storage is that only the user depends on who has access to certain types of information.
The company calls it "personal backup through data".
The idea of Inrapt, according to the executive director of John Bruce, is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Li, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several development programmers with a project work agreement and a volunteer community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrapt website.
Berners-Li said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely turned upside down over the night.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a media release, published on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that "Inrapt's mission is to enable commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the internet by establishing the Consortium of the World Network of the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
Recently, Berners-Li is an influential speaker in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even at the start of Inrapt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the Consortium of the World Network, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am a great optimist for the new era of the internet," Berners-Li added.
Bernard Van: A well - known carrier of the Victorian cross of the first world war
The only Anglican priest who received the Victorian cross during the first world war as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel Bernard Van received recognition on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Bellengiz and Lehaukur.
However, he was killed four days later by sniper and never found out that he had won the highest British military medal.
A monumental stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rassden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received his distinction.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin "Niz very thick fog and under a strong fire of guns and machine guns".
He later ran to the sites where he was shooting, and with “the greatest courage, ” he went ahead, before attacking the gun’s nest and decapitating three of his servants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I'll never be able to fulfill, but it's something that doesn't make him humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Van also put a wedding after the parade led by the Young Imperial Band of Brentwood.
Michael Van said that "it is a great honor to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given by many people".
The fans of the combined martial arts remained awake all night to watch Belator 206, instead of getting Pepa Prase
Imagine, you're awake all night to watch Belator 206, and you don't have a chance to watch the main event.
San Jose's list contained 13 matches, including six with the main card shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
On the 6th of the morning, only Gerard Mosasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face, British viewers remained exhausted when the channel was transferred to Pepa Prase.
Some were not impressed after staying awake until early hours because of the struggle.
One of Twitter fans described the transfer of a child's cartoon film as "a painful joke".
"The law is such that at 6 a.m., that content was inappropriate, so they had to be transferred to a children's programme," said Dave Schwarz, Vice-President of Belator for marketing and communication, when asked about the transfer.
"Pepa pig", yes"
Belator Scott Cooker's president said they would work on a schedule that would include Britain's visitors in the future.
"I think that when I think about re-launching, I think we can probably find a solution," Kuker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to find a solution on Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we received a lot of messages during the transfer, and none of them were kind.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to deliver more because of fans and we overrun.
That's an unfortunate situation.
Disks on the empty island: Tom Dale felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic Jumper Tom Dale says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that motivated him to succeed.
24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to high school that "all aren't like me"
Speaking on the first radio 4 empty island disco show, presented by Lauren Lavern, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular representative of the long - term Kirsty Young show took a month's rest because of the disease.
Appearing as a parallel figure in Lavern's first program, Dale said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity were the things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-brown medalist became a known supporter of LGBT companies and used his performance of this year's Commonwealth in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly and wanted to give “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said about a man's love - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Blake, who met him in 2013 - "suddenly".
Daley made a marriage to the constable, who was 20 years old last year, but said the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much early age" -- he went to the first Olympics at 14 years of age, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it's hard to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar heights and depths.
Both became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Dale said "all his views" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was related to "I should win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the gold medal of the Olympics.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dale said his father did not accept death and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I held my hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - jumping in front of the home audience in the Olympic Games, no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Pride by Heather Small - that turned his head in preparations for the Olympics and from which he was still enthralled.
Discs on the empty island of Bi-Bi-Ci Radio 4 are Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Mikelson, the horse is not in shape, was on the bench during Cupot Ryder on Saturday.
American Phil Mikelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays the 47th Cup Ryder game, but will have to change the format to avoid an unfortunate turnout.
Mikelson, who played the biennal event, recorded 12th time, was sent to Captain Jim Furick's bench during Saturday's double pairs and fours.
Instead of being in the center of attention, as often represents the United States, the fifth winner, he divided the time to master and practice his game, the scope, with the hope that he will correct what he is doing.
He was never the best leader, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf Nazional playground, where the far-reaching rough hits regular punishment in neglect.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mikelson, at the ninth competition on Sunday, faces the British Open French Molinari precision champion, who plays in a pair with beginner Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans, who lack four points before 12 individual matches, start hard, Mikelson's game can be decisive.
Furick expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see another.
"He fully understood the role he had today, touched me on my back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a part of the celebrities, and he's been given a lot for these teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two matches.
I was thinking more, but that's how it went, and we thought we had to do it.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
Mikelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Cup Ryder matches on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in Cupot Ryder where he never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 lost matches and seven and a half, although Furik said his presence carries something immaterial to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, sensitive, he wants to joke with people and he's a great man at team meetings," he explained.
"I think younger players had fun playing with him, as well as this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead to individual competitions in the last day of Cupot Ryder can easily be turned into a non-combustible position.
The Danes debited a game in Valderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Balesteros had a five-point lead in front of the Americans, but "they crossed the target line only with the noses", with a minimum of 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"I remind myself that we had a lot of leadership in Valderama; we had a lot of leadership in Bruklein, when we lost in Valderama, when we won for a while," said Byorn, a painter, after watching the 2018 class win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead on Le Golf Nazional.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You're going ready for tomorrow.
Get out and play properly.
This is not over until the game is over.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win the trophy and focus on it.
I say all the time, I focus on 12 players in our team, but we are fully aware of the opponent -- the best players in the world."
He added: “I don’t want to make premature assessments on that question.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
Individual games are expected tomorrow, and that is a different thing.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then all the skills are tested as a golfer.
That's the message to be sent to the players, to give themselves up tomorrow.
Now, you leave the partner and he should give everything to himself."
Unlike Byorn, opponent Jim Furik will ask players to play better individually than they used to play in twos, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points of four.
Furik himself was at both ends of the last day's changes, because he was part of the winning team in Brukline before he ended up as a loser when Europe took out the "Miracle in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when he was asked about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, united players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start as early as the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment moves in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle competitions.
We set the line properly and the team's order is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of resisting first and facing Rory McClore's most important competition, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Polter with other Europeans in the most important half of the sequence.
"I decided to do this with the guys because I think that's how we'll cover it all," Bjorn said about the choice in individual games.
The new German military ship has been postponed again
The German Navy's latest cargo was to be delivered in 2014 to replace the old warships since the Cold War, but it will not happen until at least next year due to the wrong systems and growing prices, local media reported.
The delivery of Rainland-Faltz, the leading new class ship Baden-Wittemberg, is now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the DiCate newspaper, calling on the military's spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014 but the problematic questions after delivery prevented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Whiteberg class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be replaced by the obsolete Bremen class frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful top, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and marine missiles, as well as some steel technology, as a low radar, infrared and acoustic trail.
Among other important features is porous maintenance - it should be possible, the latest fracturings, to be absent for up to two years from home ports.
However, constant delays mean that modern warships -- which should enable Germany to have power over the oceans -- will be already obsolete until they enter the service, notes DeCate.
The F125 crash hit the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and return it to the Blom and Vos shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after the shipment.
A little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cites a number of key "software and hardware defects" for which the warship was useless if sent to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because Baden-Whiteberg's ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors -- only half the crew of the older Bremens.
It has also shown that the ship is dramatically above the planned weight that reduces its performance and limits the ability of the sailor to add upgrades to the future.
Rainland-Faltz weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be a double burden on similar class ships that Germany used in World War II.
In addition to the problematic hardware, the cost of the whole project - including crew training - has also become a problem.
It is said that it has reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) - an increase of the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems faced by the latest fractals are particularly important because of warnings about Germany's reduced maritime power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartelles, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, confirmed that the Navy "has lost ships that could be deployed".
The representative said that the problem had worsened over time, because the old ships were withdrawn from service, but not secure ships for replacement.
He complained that none of the Baden-Whiteberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Lions
A new research is being carried out on property in the Scottish mountain ranges to find out how the lilys use the food range.
There is hope that the discovery will provide answers to the behavior of unique flying boars and help in conducting future protection activities.
Studying the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow the ordinary and soprano lilacs, as well as the coffee lilacs with long ears and doubenton lillages in Inverow Garden in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track the lilac activities during the season.
En-Aich-Es personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds from all the photos will determine the frequency depending on the species of lilies.
Then a map will be developed with habitats to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the border.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser in En-Ti-Es, hopes that the results will reveal what areas of life are most important to the lilacs and how they are used by each species.
Such information will help to determine the benefits of management of habitats, such as the creation of meadows and the best use of forest management for lilacs and other related species.
The population of lilacs in Scotland and Britain has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects the beds and the loss of habitats.
Veterans and lights also pose risks, as well as stickers for flies and some chemical treatments on building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
The lilys don't actually get blind.
Yet, because of their nightly fishing habits, their ears are more likely to be used than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to find the insects and obstacles in the flight path.
En-Ti-Es, who takes care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the lilys very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who carry out regular investigations, bedside inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even founded the first and only lily reserve in Scotland at the property of Triv in Damfris and Galoy, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
The property manager David Thompson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Triv we have a great area for lilacs," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good dwellings.
But there are many unknown things about the lily, so the work we do here and other properties will help us learn more about what they need to make progress."
He stresses the importance of checking whether there are lilacs before property renovations are carried out because unconscious destruction of the bed can destroy up to 400 females and infants, and destroy the entire local population.
The lioness are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, or disturb themselves or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official in Trust for the Protection of Lillians, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still need to learn a lot about lions and other species, we just don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo rejected the charges of rape, and lawyers will sue the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo called allegations of rape "false news", and added that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spigel, who announced the charges.
Portugal's attacker and Juventus is accused of rapeing the American, named Catherine Majorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375,000 in order not to talk about the incident, said Der Spigel on Friday.
Speaking on a live video of Instagram to its 142 million followers, a few hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, rejected the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," the gold ball winner said in front of his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for mentioning my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and it's all right." The player added laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spigel for the charges, which they called "an unacceptable transfer of suspicions from private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherc said the player would seek damages for "moral damage according to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the incident that was the subject of the charges took place in June 2009 in the shadow of a hotel and the Palms Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her annal, according to documents submitted to the court in Clarke's Nevada area.
Majorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "good boy", but dropped under that "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and was taken pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to a deal without judicial involvement because she was afraid of revenge" and was concerned "that she would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says he is now demanding a change in the deal because there are traumas from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juventus with an agreement worth 100m euros.
Breggsit: Britain "will always regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain will "always regret" if it loses the status of world leader in car production after Bregzit, business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "disquieting" that Toyota-British reported about the Bi-Bi-Ci, that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We don't need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the impact of border stops in the case of Bregzit without an agreement would cost jobs.
The factory in Brunston - produced by Toyota Auris and Avencis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be a stop to production in our factory," said Marvin Cook, the managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concern about the functioning of cross-border trade when leaving the EU without an agreement, including Honda, Be-M-Ve and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, Be-M-Ve says he's going to close his mini factory in Oxford a month after Bregsit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call the risks of the logistics chain in the case of Bregsit without agreement.
Toyota's production line works according to the system "exactly on time", where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a break in the border which, according to the industry, could cause delays and gaps in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock of inventory in the factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Teresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely made to avoid such border checks".
"We need to have an agreement. We need to have the best agreement that will allow us not only the success we will enjoy in the present time, but to seize this opportunity," he said about the current Bi-Bi-Ci Radio 4 programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other producers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains."
He could not say how long the production would have been stopped, but he warned for a long time that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and cost jobs.
Peter Cualaris, who has been working in Burundi for 24 years and is a representative of the union in the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "As far as my experience is concerned, once these jobs are lost, they will never return.
According to a government spokesman, "We have put together a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, the White House announces
Donald Trump's important meeting with deputy public defender Rod Rosenstein can be "delayed for another week" because he continues to fight about Bret Cavano's nomination for a judge in the Supreme Court," the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia and the potential violation of the laws by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy public defender and thereby threaten Miller's independence, he's been encouraging talks in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was thinking about carrying a camera to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with the announcement of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of giving up.
Instead, the Trump meeting was scheduled for Thursday because he was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid clashing with the Senate Justice Committee's hearing in which he witnessed and Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blake Ford.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kawano, which will further postpone the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sara Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting is not yet fixed, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week, given all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things are going, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters argue: Sanders hasn't given a briefing to reporters in the White House since 10 September.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings is not due to the "great influence" of TV journalists, although he added: "I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media be increased.
"The president organizes multiple sessions of questions and answers from any president before him," she said, adding without giving any evidence: "We have considered those figures."
There will still be briefings, said Sanders, but "if the press has a direct chance to ask questions to the president of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often and you're witnesses that we've been doing it all the time over the past few weeks, and talks with the president of the United States will replace the briefings for reporters."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting high officials.
She rarely participates in solo press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why it is so with his uncontrolled and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
Health Secretary with a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system regarding Bregzit's fears
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and their desire to remain after Bregzit.
Jean Freeman, a deputy in the Scottish Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the costs of the status-resolved applications for EU citizens working in lower-level public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU for withdrawal continued during the summer, with the aim of making the expected decisions this autumn.
But the United Kingdom government has also intensified preparations for the possibility of reaching an agreement.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to stress how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the workforce, regardless of his nationality.
EU-wide colleagues share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are useful to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Cristion Abercromby subjected to an emergency operation after having suffered head injury
Cristion Abercrombi, the tennis State Tigers' linebacker, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 of the Vanderbilt Commodores team, Mike Organ of Tennessee said.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred immediately before half-time.
"He came to the side line of the playground and was only strung to the ground," Reid said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercromby oxygen outside the playground, and then put it in the gym and carried it to a further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of "WSMV" in Nesville, Tennessee, that Abercromby had left surgery at the medical centre "Vanderbilt Medical Center".
Harris added that "there is still no information on the nature/level of the injury" and "Tennessee State" trying to find out when the injury actually happened.
Abecrombi is a second-year student and plays her first season in red dress in "Tennessee State" after the transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five fights on Saturday before he left the game, resulting in a total of 18 fights made this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
According to Thori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
This move will neutralize Corbin's attempt to attract young voters
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The ministry expects this move to raise up to 120 million pounds a year, which will be used to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbin's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and to focus on high-income people.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional funds supporting the government's efforts to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional amount that, in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property with a view to renting it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects this move to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by individuals who are not citizens of the United Kingdom, which has led to price increases and has caused difficulties for people who buy property for the first time to engage in this domestic property purchase process.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "the cities of spirits" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
This new policy was published only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of offering high prices of the property with which they keep the land, but did not use it and asked Mrs. May to change the quotas for accessible homes in order to correct the "hungry situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive domestic reforms, including housing controls and ending exiles without a valid reason.
He also wants to give councils more authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime minister to the return of the British dream, that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our damaged domestic market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies to be able to buy homes as easily as the valuable British residents.
The dream of owning their own home for many people has become too remote, and the humiliation of homeless people is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to run with Scotland"
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland said his "final ambition" was in the future to become the manager of the Scottish national club.
The Scottish, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the North East Club, which is currently in third place in the first league with only three points less than the club at the top.
This summer he moved to the "Station of Light" after returning St. Mirren back to the Scottish Prime Minister League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross said about the Scottish Sports Sound of BBC.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father and something always dragged me back.
However, I could only get that opportunity if I'm successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager are Dick Advokaat, David Moes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kein, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former head of Alloa Athletic says he felt no anxiety knowing that such names should be followed in such a large club after he previously rejected the offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is assessed by "can I return this club to the Premier League?"
In view of the structure and objects in this club, he certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task for this club to get there, but I'll probably think I've achieved success here only if I get the club back there."
Ross works as a manager for only three years, in which he has been in the career since he worked as chief's assistant in Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped Alloa secure from the third league and returned St. Mirren from his job of losing his title in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than when he played "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St. Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"That was probably a real crossroads to me," he recalls taking over "Alloa."
"I sincerely believed that career as manager is the right choice for me, better choice than career as a player.
It sounds strange because it was going well, I earned enough of it, and I enjoyed certain high titles.
But building a career as a player can be very difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a Sunday basis.
I’m still going through certain things in terms of stress and work pressure, but I just feel good about the manager’s role.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I'm doing this, and I feel more comfortable in this role than ever in my adult life."

According to one study, the perfect time for beer is 17:30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profit of British pubs, which are currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw an increase in sales of 2.7 percent in July, but the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA company for business consulting services in determining these numbers said: "The sun's time and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when the profits of the pubs increased by 2.8 percent and the restaurants decreased significantly.
The fall in sales of 1.8 percent of restaurants in June has worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which drinks are sold mainly have seen much more growth compared to the previous years in contrast with the restaurants where the decline was observed.
The pubs in which food is sold mostly were also badly hit by the sun, although not as dramatic as the owners of restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and the sale of food by only three percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for vacation and hospitality from the "RSM" said: "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to the sale of the market outside the home.
It is no surprise at all that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent over a year will be particularly devastating as a complement to current pressures that create costs.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for local owners in which food is sold predominantly, and time would show if the moderate temperatures we had in August would provide the much needed respiration."
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the stop in publishing new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker tracking device for sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes data on the effectiveness of the same 47 operational groups with a combined revenue of over 9 billion pounds and represents a determined reper for the industry.
One of the five children has a secret profile on social media that they hide from their parents
A survey showed that one of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret profile on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers
Research in which 20,000 secondary schools were involved has shown an increase in the number of fake Instagram profiles
The news increases the fear that sexual content appears in such profiles
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" profile that they show their parents
One of five children, some of whom are only 11 years of age, creates a social media profile that they hide from adults.
The research in which 20,000 secondary schools were involved showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" profiles, a shortcut to the Instagram website where photographs are shared.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being displayed on such profiles.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main" profile that they showed their parents, and then they had other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret profile found a teenager who asks others to "violate him."
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them is a secret.
HMC chief Mike Bukenan said: "It's really disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" of the Scottish Athletics committee
Elid Doyle was elected a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Committee at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most famous athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Biti described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in this sport to take advantage of her wide international experience over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and World Athletic Community has great respect for Elid and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a member of the committee," Biti said.
Doyle said: “I am prepared to be the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can really make my contribution and help in the proper direction of sport in Scotland."
The American who won the titles of 200 and 400 metres in the Atlanta Games in 1996, despite the total of four gold medals in the Olympic Games and which now appears regularly as a BBC commentary, could not go after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago, I received a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would tell me if I could hold on to it or to what extent.
The whole process was mutilated, but I was able to fully confirm, I can go back and practice agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
A breast pump advertisement where mothers compared cows caused a division of internet opinions
The chest pump production company caused a division of internet opinions when it published an ad in which mothers coming are compared to cow milling.
To mark the launch of the product, which is said to be "the world's largest heart pump", the user-oriented technology company Elvie announced a funny commercial inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump provides to the mothers that come from.
Four mothers dance in a cow barn full of a song-sun whose text sounds like this: "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed this doesn't come true, these are my breasts."
The refraction continues: "Fump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, stir my heart."
However, the advertisement published on Facebook the company's party caused Internet controversy.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, with many saying it highlights the "fears" of the dairy industry.
"It is really a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like we need to get pregnant and give birth so they can produce milk, except for the fact that their children are stealing from them only a few days after they are born," one of the commentators said.
The "Elvie" breast pump is discreetly integrated into the breast garden ("Elvie"/"Mother")
Another comment states: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But, yes, why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Indeed inappropriate advertising."
Others, on the other hand, defended the commercial, and one woman admitted that she felt that the song was really "Laughter."
"I think this idea is brilliant.
I'd buy a pump like this if I was still coming.
I felt just like a cow because of the mutilation.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's a brilliant product," one of the commentators voted.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement intended for mothers who make milk (often at their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like "blood."
This doesn't say what's missing or condemning the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced while discreet pumps were pumped into their gardens.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women using milking pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the "Elvie" pump is completely quiet, no wires, no pipes and discreetly fit into the breast-feeding garden, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even get out of the house while milking the milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and RDR in "Mother" commented: "The Elvie pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves brave and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between women who are milking and milk cows, we wanted milking with the help of a pump and the challenges that it brings to the center of attention, showing the incredible sense of freedom that brings the new pump in a fun and close way.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump to be present in all titles.
During the modern week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Jacobovski carrying the product.
Hundreds of children migrants quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children migrants in detention has increased significantly although the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to accommodate children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were unreported immigrants and were afraid of threatening their country’s own stay if they asked to be a child’s sponsor.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a high immigration and customs official last week, testified before the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsorship of minors without joining.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested have no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors illegally reside in the country and many of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That's why we keep chasing those individuals," Mr. Albens said.
In order to speed up the handling of children, authorities have introduced new rules according to which some of them will be required to appear in court within one month after they are detained, not within 60 days, as security workers say they voted the previous standard.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not personally, in order to issue their case for legal status before the immigration judge.
Those who are considered unfit for relief will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they will become upset and depressed, which may lead to violent incidents or attempts to escape, the workers in shelters and reports that have appeared from the system in the last few months.
Lawyers say that such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornilo, where because of its size there is a greater likelihood of neglecting the signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving the children to the tent city without providing them with enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could increase the trauma most of them are already facing.
Syria told US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem has called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has lasted for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces illegally resided in the territory of Syria under oath to participate in the fight against terrorism and that "they will be treated appropriately."
"They must withdraw immediately and without setting conditions," he told the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to lead this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of the two terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom are trained and advised by the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of this country destroyed by the war.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions are good for them to return and accused "some of the Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" which encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing the question which should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would not be provided reconstruction aid until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war was reached.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on setting up a buffer zone in the last major rebellion in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia against the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed towards the jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
UN representative Stefan de Mistura hopes that he will soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of government members and opposition in order to prepare a constitutional constitution for Syria and open the way to the elections.
Mualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying the work of the panel should be limited to "viewing members of the current constitution," and warned about the consequences of further mixing in the same.
Why Trump will take second mandate
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again unless his presidential mandate is temporarily interrupted with an impression and scandal, most of which are probably hoped for by the Liberals.
What will no doubt be "the most dramatic finale in the presidency that has ever been seen!"
From now on, there's no sign of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the impact-time rating has increased more than double and reached 1.05 million in "CNN" and has almost tripled and reached 1.6 million in "MSNBC".
Nielsen says that "Fox News" on average has 2.4 million visitors in the hit-time, which is 1.7 million more compared to the period four years ago, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" of "MSNBC" reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million visitors in the evenings when important news is announced.
"This is like a fire that people feel attracted to because it's not something we understand," says Neil Bayer, the chief television producer of the "Designed Survivors" drama of "ABC" for a cabinet secretary who has become president since Capitol was destroyed by the attack.
Nell Skovell, a veteran in the writing comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He answered, "Because I think he's really funny," Mrs. Skowel told me.
There's a certain amount of fun in all of the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, as well as the welfare of the global economy.
Disfellowshipping is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you've been watching a six-hour panel of experts discussing the use of the source of "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", a bomber jacketed by the skin of Paul Manafort of $15,000 ( "Deal with fat arrogance," as he called "The Washington Post") and the implications of Mr. Trump's shocking anatomy by Stormi Daniels.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what he does and what makes you feel like watching a real show is that every night he brings you something new," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the Pay Stars for the tramp show's rotating team and daily shifts (carriage with NFL, thanks to Kim Young-un).
You can't let yourself miss an episode because then you won't be able to compensate.
When I visited Mr. Flaice this week, it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked in and watched "MSNBC" while shooting "CNN".
He could not stop watching, at least not when Brett Cavano was supposed to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was critical.
"I remember making all those crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Influx of foreign funds in the most difficult mid-year elections in the Upper House race
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional Area in Pennsylvania receives a large amount of funds thanks to the reorganisation of congress areas from where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
For this recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh, a representative of Democrats Connor Lamb, who took place in another area of the extraordinary elections last spring, is being run.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Kit Rotfus, who currently represents the old 12th congressional area, and which largely overlaps with the new 17th congressional area.
The maps were changed after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old areas were manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th Congressional Area is a difficult competition for funding campaigns among key sponsors of the parties, the Congressional Campaign Committee of the Democratic Party (‘DCCC’) and the National Campaign Committee of the Republican Party (‘NRCC’).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the extraordinary elections for the 18th convention area in Pennsylvania held in March, characterized by a wide media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place has been occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump has conquered the area with 20 points.
Political experts give little advantage to the Democrats.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then he quit.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under low pressure by Washington.
Mr. Trump in June 2017 had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," said Heather Naweert, State Department spokesman in his statement at the beginning of this month.
But only with respect to El Salvador were punishments taken into account, which received US aid of around $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have a harmful impact on the country in Central America and high unemployment and killing rates in the country.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central America representatives postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar gathering last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administrative officials stressed that they wanted the conference to progress and effectively put an end to every thought about the punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pens should address the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance that the board attaches to the gathering, diplomats say.
And the three US officials returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of difficult messages or sentences from Washington.
The White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American representatives, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal reflections on the state of anonymity.
Their positions were supported by an external analyst who was close to the administration and who was also talking about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that might happen is to publish a report by Special Adviser Robert Miller on a possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's justice, which is currently very strong evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller reportedly also directs his investigation into the fact that Mr. Trump's campaign is linked to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of the Congress has changed, Mr. Trump will have to bear responsibility in that body while preparing to appear again before the voters, and perhaps also before the jury of his colleagues.
There are many uncertainties here, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, not even to his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic need to make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to launch a state attack on Hitler if the West opposed and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed to do so and missed the opportunity to avoid the following massacre years.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the unquestionable march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are now facing a number of such changes.
What if Mr. Trump resigned from Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Miller's fate?
Rosenstein is on the hot table after this newspaper announced that last year he proposed to secretly record the president and speculated that he was unfit for the job he was doing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if Brett Cavano's new investigation requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or incorrect, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of the year for the Congress to accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fall on all these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I believe that will not happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to burn candles for Sabat at a table with a swastika logo.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans of Rankers with an optimistic attitude in front of the Rapid Vienna conflict
"Rangers" are host to the Rapid Vienna match Thursday, and then they are aware of the fact that after the game's unresolved game against "Villareal" in Spain at the beginning of this month, the victory over Austrians will strengthen their position to qualify in Group G in the League of Europe.
Graham Dorens, a middle-class player due to knee injury, was prevented from appearing in the season until the unresolved 2-2 game with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use that result as a leapboard towards larger achievements.
"That was a good point for us because "Villarreal" is a good opponent," the 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and returned with a winning point.
We might have been able to give a little more at the end, but the unresolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half, and we were better.
Another great European night awaits us Thursday.
I hope we win three points, but it'll be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but I'm sure with the fan support we'll return and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a difficult year in view of everything that happened — my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor in the place.
The team is good, and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Women cannot sleep at night because of this fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear view of the way they wanted to be cared for, few spoke with family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by the Nationwide said they talked to their marriage friends about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't take steps to discuss the same," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Animal Insurance Company.
Here's where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide for you if you do not share your wishes with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how such choices can be a factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your choice to finance long-term care can include a traditional policy for long-term care, a hybrid policy for animal welfare in cash, which can help you cover your expenses or provide yourself with your own funds, if you have them.
Manage your legal documents: Avoid legal battles even at the beginning.
Take full care of health care so that you can empower a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that health professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Think, too, about your financial resources.
In this way, they would choose a person of confidence to bear the financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do so on your own.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about the medications he drinks and his allergies?
Note these details in a written form to be prepared.

A man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he returned home from his departure.
The victim of about 40 years of age was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb when he was shot in his chest, stomach, and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST (British summer time) as "a random act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police appeal to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of severe earthquakes and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials reported, expecting to increase the number of victims.
As a result of the interruption of the communications, the aid could not receive information from Dongala County, a region north of Pala, which is closer to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people from Palu were evacuated after the disaster.
Several key facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulavesi:
Palou is the capital of the province of Central Sulavesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunami.
Dongala is a county that stretches over 300 kilometers (180 miles) on the coast in the northwestern part of the island of Sulavesi.
The district, which represents an administrative region within the province, in 2017 had an estimated population of 299,200.
Fishing and agriculture are major sources of income for the economy of the province of Central Sulavesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Indonesia's disaster relief agency says that Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Also, tsunamis struck West Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismic Pacific ring of fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them were residents of Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra by the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Earthquake of 6.8 degrees hit the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, causing tsunamis to destroy the southern coast and killing almost 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake hit the area near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 - degree earthquake struck one of the Mentawaj islands near Sumatra, causing tsunamis that reached up to ten feet [10 m] and destroyed tens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: Earthquake focused hit the Pidy Jaya District in Aceh, causing desolation and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time the earthquake did not cause tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by fallen buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the tourist island Lombok in Indonesia, with more than 500 people killed, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily detained.
Sara Palin's oldest son arrested for charges of family violence
Trek Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sara Palin was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vasil, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of family violence, mixed in a report on family violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by police officials in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Palin is in the Mat-su detention facility with an option to exit if he pays a sum of $500, KTUU said.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "finally innocent" when asked how he explained himself before the court, they said from the network.
Palin faces three A-class violations, which means he can be sentenced to imprisonment for up to a year and a 250,000-dollar fine.
He is also charged with a B-class violation, a one-day prison sentence and a 2,000-dollar fine.
This is not the first time they've been charged with crimes against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the vet court in Alaska is under way.
In January 2016, he was charged with a domestic attack, a mix in the crime report on family violence and possession of arms under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her face.
Sara Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016, after saying that her son's violent behavior is derived from the PTSN, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake struck the area near Central Sulavesi, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Social media are circling video showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for the terrorist attack suspect in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death sentence for Syfolo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York where eight people died, a rare sentence that has not been committed in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a home depot rental truck in October to attack the West Side motorway in lower Manhattan and drive the pedestrians and the bikers on their way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intended" killed the eight victims and "intended" caused serious bodily injuries, according to a report on the intention to seek a death penalty delivered to the South District of New York.
According to the court documents, there is an opportunity to express a death sentence on both of these grounds by the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury filed an accusation against Saipov on 22 grounds, including eight charges of murder for the purposes of recruitment, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
"Detailed planning and thinking was needed to carry out the attack," the prosecutors said, in which the way Saipov did it was described as "grosssome, harsh and insidious."
"Syfolo Habibulaevic Saipov caused, injured, damage and loss of families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Lore Decat, Daren Drake, Ariel Erley, Hernán Ferci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho," the state announced the intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since there was a fatal case in the South District of New York.
The defendant, Calid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for July and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been sentenced to two years earlier for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both were sentenced to death by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
The police said that he told the investigators he felt good about what he was doing.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching the video of ISIS on his phone.
The police also announced that he had asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He explained that he was innocent on all 22 grounds of the charge.
David Patton, one of the allied public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "evidently disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt and expressing a life sentence without the possibility of release will only continue the trauma of these events for all those involved," Paton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
MP from the Tori Party says NIJJEL FARAZ should be responsible for the Breggsit negotiations
Nigel Faraz today during a protest at the Tori party conference, he promised to "mobilize the people's army".
Former leader of the Ukip party said politicians must "respect the heat" of the Eurosceptics, with one of Teresa May's MPs proposing that he be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bon on the march in Birmingham said the United Kingdom would so far "be outside the EU" if Mr. Faraz was secretary for Bregzit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in terms of joining her deeply divided members was highlighted by the members of the Tori Party who joined a special protest against Bregzit held in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the Checkers plan despite the attacks by pro-Brecit people, counter-Brecit people and the EU.
The allies insisted that it will continue its efforts to reach agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that it will force the Eurosceptics and the Labourist party members to choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bon said to Pro-Bregzit the "Leave Means Leave" assembly in Solihal that he wanted "to reject the Plan of Checkers".
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for the negotiations, we would have been out of the EU so far," he said.
The Ambassador of Wellingboro added: "I will support Bregzit, but we must reject the Plan of Checkers."
Expressing his attitude against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars so that we could now be subdued.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected the suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and wants to remain in the EU is completely incorrect."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tori and pro-Brügzit party, was also present on the march and told reporters: "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Checkers plan is not well accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually those who go out on the streets and who owe our victory to the elections.
Please give up the Checkers plan and start listening to us."
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraz of the assembly said politicians must "sympathize with heat" if they intend to pass on the decision that was made at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to hand over Bregzit, and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let you get away with it."
In a message to the awe - inspiring crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is to hand over to Bregzit, feel the heat.
"We mobilize the people's army of this country which has enabled us to win in Bregzit and which will not stop until we become independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, counter-Bregzit people marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour assembly in the city centre.
After the group's gathering, a few activists who wore banners with the title "Torivs v. Bregzit" appeared this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Laburist Party, laughed at the conservatives about the security issues facing the opening of the conference on the party's application.
"These are people who tell us they can set up IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus, for border without control, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing called good Bregzit," he added.
Warren plans to think well about candidateing for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he "will think better about candidateing as president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe said the Democratic Party representative of Massachusetts was talking about his future during the city assembly in Western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, an honorary critic of President Donald Trump, will run again in November against the Republican Party's national representative Jeff Dill, who was co-chaired by Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was in the centre of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holiok was her 36th meeting with voters after Trump came to the presidential office, using the format of a city council.
One of the present asked her if she was planning to run for the president.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our corrupt government, including putting women on top."
Arrested suspect for the shooting and death of basketball player Sims from the LSU team
The police in Baton Rož, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect for shooting and the death of basketball player Wade Sims from the LSU team that happened on Friday was arrested.
The police department in Baton Rož announced Deiton Simpson's arrest, 20, at a press conference at 11 o'clock in the east.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man of the shooting.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Vade Sims had a gunshot wound in his head and as a result of the same death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, "247sports."
Wade was involved in defending his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene of the crime, owned weapons, and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested in the Paris Police Department of the East Baton Rouge.
As a 192 - foot - tall junior who grew up in Baton Rose, Sims played 32 matches with 10 performances last season, on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 hits after the match.
Gran Pri to Russia: Luis Hamilton closer to the world title after the team with its orders secured the victory over Sebastian Vetel
Since Walter Botas qualified in front of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the orders of the Mercedes team will play a major role in the race.
From the semi-position Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on a cedilo while defending his position in the first two circles and invited Vetel to attack his partner.
He went into the box first and let Hamilton fight the mutiny at the end of the group, something that should have played a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and came behind the Vetel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of one who forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior of his free risk to remain side by side after the double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Verstapen started from the back row of the network and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended in seventh place.
Then he led most of the race and directed the tires of his car to reach the finish line and to reach Kimmy Raikonen, taking fourth place.
He finally entered the 44th round box, but couldn't increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikonen came fourth.
It's a tough day today because Walter's done a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me go.
The team made a truly exclusive decision to have its two in the race," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad speech on the body.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Finestein at a meeting Saturday about her insistence that she did not publish Christine Blassi Ford's letter accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavano of sexual assault.
In his speech at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not address Ford's testimony directly to the Senate's Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are "serious and unscrupulous and dishonest."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's happening in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and angry and reckless and unrelenting," he said.
"When you see releases and flow of information and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do You Remember?
Diana Finestein, did you publish this information?
You remember her answer... did you publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute, then.
Did we publish it... no, we didn't publish it," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter was sent to Finnstein with information on the allegations against Cavano by Ford in July, and they were published in early September, but Finnstein denied that the flow of information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't publish her story," Finnstein told the committee, "The Hill."
"She asked me to keep them in confidence, and I did what she asked."
But it seems that the president does not believe her denial, so he commented on the same meeting on Saturday: “I will tell you one thing, it was really a bad speech on the body.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst speech I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use instructions to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to restore power in any way.
You can see their evil, shame, they don't care who they're gonna hurt, who they're gonna have to bend to get their power and control back," the president said as Mediaite says.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants in the match against Dundee
Dundee Stars rewarded for losing the elite league match on Friday against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 prize in Dandi on Saturday.
"Giants" have gained the advantage of two goals that Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovilier achieved.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Couni have gained the advantage of the host in front of Dwyer to return the leadership of Giants.
Francoa Bushar equally for Dundee in front of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen to ensure their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat in the season under the elite league for Adam Kifi's boys, who returned with victory over Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with Giants winning in the previous three matches.
Chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, namely at 3:35 with Kendall McFol's addition, which was secured by David Rutherford while Bovilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the competition, Sullivan provided host leadership at 13:10, before Matt Mercart assisted Kauni to achieve the result at 15:16.
Two take care of Giants taking the lead until the first break, when he reached the second goal for the night at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard returned them with a powerful game and goal, with the result at 27:37.
Couni and Charles Corkran were combined to help Nielsen for the first time to provide the leadership of Dundee in the game late in the second period and he secured the victory of his team half of the last period of the fifth match.
Giants, who lost four of their last five matches, will play their next match on Friday at the Milton Kanes home field.
Flight controller killed helping hundreds of people on a plane escape the earthquake
A flight controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after he died helping a plane with hundreds of people to fly safely.
More than 800 people died, and many disappeared after the great earthquake hit the island of Sulavesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong consequential earthquakes continue to ravage the area, and many are trapped in urinates in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues avoided saving their own lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung refused to leave his position at Mutiara Sis Al Juffrey Airport in Palou, which was constantly falling apart.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air plane with flight number 6321 which was then on the runway would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower at the moment he thought the tower was breaking.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirairt, spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that its decision probably saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News said.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palo.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Bhutan is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the urine, until many can't even access," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The dams that reached six feet [6 m] have devastated Pala, where a mass funeral will be held Sunday.
Military and commercial planes carry supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother said about Sky News: "The quick help carries bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The minimarkets are robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said of CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is fast helping survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesia’s president, Yoko Vidodo, arrived in Palo on Sunday and ordered the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombardy, with more than 550 people killed.
A plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says that a man disappeared after the plane crashed into the lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that a man has disappeared, after previously stating that the 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the plane that was ton.
The announcement "Air Niugini" said that from Saturday afternoon they could not find the male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuck Island Airport.
Officials announced on Friday that seven persons were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the precise order of events, remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane hit the lagoon near the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was missing the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's an extremely good job," Janes said.
Janes said that he and others were able to cross the water that reached them by half and point to the exits for emergency cases on the plane that landed.
He said that the stewardess were panicking and shouting, as well as that he suffered a little head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working near the port reconstruction also helped rescue by using a boat to take people to the shore before the plane to sink about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents of aircraft registered in the PNG in the last two decades, but none of the airlines "Air Niugini" were included.
Analyst sets the time frame at night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended by presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of the man who was accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rovlet, an analyst from the U.S. Ministry of Justice, witnessed for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He pointed out to the jury that he used phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlet said he received information about the location of several mobile phones showing that Telesis was with Chambers the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, said "The Clarion Ledger".
When on the basis of the data it was shown that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was interrogated on Saturday and testified that that day was not in the city.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth by saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Phone records show that they only knew one week.
Rowlet said some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense should present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide on the case later that day.
"The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to defeat the negative attitude of this genre by including positive messages in his music.
Bristol's "The High Breed" claims that the hip-hopot is far from its origin as a music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to go back to his roots and repopulate the conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" recently experienced their life through artists such as "Akala" and "Lowkey".
Another black girl?
New York's granddaughter sues a married couple for being fired after sending a "racist" message
New York's granddaughter sues a married couple because she was fired on the basis of discrimination after she was mistakenly received a message from the mother who complained about the fact that she was "another black woman."
The couple denied that they were racist, saying the prosecution was in fact "enforcement."
Lucy Plasco-Flixman, the mother of two children, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first working day of the new nurse Giselle Morris learned that she was black.
"Don't worry about any of these black people," wrote Mrs. Plasko-Flackman in a message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing what she actually did, Plasco-Flacksman, feeling "uneasy" fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly, afro-American, gift was bad doing the job and that she expected the gift to be from the Philippines instead, says "New York Post".
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first working day and was then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris sues the marriage couple and seeks compensation for the $350-dollar release per day for a period of six months, a commitment that will involve her living with the family, what she was originally committed to, but without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things should not be done," she said on "Post" Friday, while adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple returned to the charges that they were racist, saying that Mrs. Morris' dismissal was a reasonable act because they feared that they could no longer trust her after being offended.
"My wife sent her something she didn't think of.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband for Post.
"But would you trust your children on the face of what you were rude, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Said the prosecution was a "offensive", Plasko said his wife gave birth to the baby only two months ago and that she was in "very difficult situation."
"Will you attack someone who is in such a situation?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public immediately condemns the couple’s social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Padington's publishers fear that readers will not be able to connect to a sword that speaks, is revealed in the new letter.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said regarding the letter: “It is really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very interesting that we now know all this about the huge success of Padington.
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC before getting inspiration to write the little toy book in the form of a sword, would still be optimistic if his work was not well accepted, she added that the 60-year-old of publishing the book was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt silent pride about his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't want to be missed at all," she said.
"But, because you felt that Padington was so real, it was almost like having a child who has achieved something in life: and you are proud of him even though the success is not due to you alone.
I think the success of Padington was taken up in this way.
Although it was a matter of creation and the fruit of his fantasy, he always attributed his credit to the Padington himself."
My daughter was on a deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were foolishly trying to save her life.
"Now he called me regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and that it is expected that he will not survive," Eddon-Laperuz said.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
And I said, “Tash, I really love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly and they came out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all of her systems were giving up.
I just had to sit down and wait, aware of the fact that all this is happening.
I could not scream, cry, or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to stay on guard."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz, mourning the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head on, and the tears didn't stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immense compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Grieving women set up bridge maps to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide make efforts to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfris put cards on the Wells Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says her son had great potential to become a cook, as well as a contagious smile.
"Everyone remembered him after his smile.
People always said that his smile could light up every room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was "a really dark place."
His brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after taking his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I constantly fear that this will have a consequential effect."
Ms. Davis makes the cards "to let others know that there are people out there who can talk to and talk to, even if it's about a friend.
Don't sit still, you need to start talking."
Mrs. Hamfris, who is Mrs. Davis' long friend, lost her partner Mark with whom she was married 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, or he didn't say anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas when the children opened their presents, and he did not look at them at all and establish no contact with them."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to all of them, but they had to find a way to get through it: “That’s what upsets the family.
It leaves us vulnerable.
But we must continue to fight."

Brett Cavano's future is uncertain after the FBI has launched the investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something similar to what he was looking for, namely researching with limited time, with limited scope, we might be able to achieve a small unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee "disappears" in terms of the ingrained partisan wireless state.
Why didn't the FBI and its supporters of the Republican Party want to conduct an investigation?
Their flexibility depends only on the timing.
The mid-term elections should be held only for a few weeks, i.e. on 6 November, and if, as the Republicans are expected to face failure, they will then be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their person as a member of the highest court in the country.
George V. Bush calls the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Cavano who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavano can have at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, enabling Vice-President Mike Pens to change the unresolved outcome and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea has "reduced" under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Young-un came into power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Park Beeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Uniting Ministry, said last year there were 1,127 crossings on the border compared to 2011, when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said the tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs on human smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang was not commenting publicly.
Most North Korean refugees are currently receiving citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run across China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and which can be easily crossed in comparison with the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still at war, has improved significantly in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, leaders from the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on the halt of the denuclearisation negotiations.
This was followed by a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Young-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal - the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused on Saturday of sanctions imposed by the United States of stagnation in progress since then.
"If there is no confidence in the United States; there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions we cannot unarm ourselves unilaterally first," Mr. Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Cavano "historic" and said he was not fit to serve at the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House called the candidate for the Bret Cavano Supreme Court "historic" and said that if his temper is taken into account, he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not but think that if a woman acted that way, they would say it is "historic," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kawano's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blassi Ford when they were teenagers.
Cavano was very emotional at his opening presentation, sometimes even shouting and waving while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "grossy and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organised by the liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said she believed that Cavano's testimony was proof that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it proved that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualificating himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to lower Cavano from office if the allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth before the Congress or the FBI, then he not only is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not fit to serve in the court where he is currently in office," Pelosi said.
Kavano is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democracy, she is concerned about the possible convictions that Kavano will bring against the Act on Access to Health Care or Roe versus Wade, because he is considered to be the subject of conservative justice.
In hearings to confirm his candidacy, Kavano did not answer the questions about whether to annul some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to enter the court and expect us to say, "it's really wonderful, isn't it," said Pelosi.
Women should use it, too.
It's a really sharp criticism, months and years of gathering anger, which she can't get rid of without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She went on, “A woman who had performed an executive job somewhere and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she was able to develop her technique, so when she gets angry and starts to cry, she tells the person what she is talking about, ” she says,“ Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
I think that's genius."
The tears are allowed as an exhaled vent for anger partly because they are essentially misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of one of my first jobs in the office where the men dominated is when I once started crying with unremarkable anger and an older woman, a cold manager of whom I always had a certain fear, caught me by the neck and took me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will enjoy the fact that they've managed to reach you."
Patricia Schroeder was a Democratic Congressman from Colorado during that period and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a foreign affair on a ship called "Monkey Business" and withdrawn from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason for her not to consider the idea of running for the president.
"That was not a well-considered decision," he told me 30 years later in laughter.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow and the Seven Dwarves."
Given the fact that the campaign had been launched a long time ago, it did not have enough financial resources, so it promised it would not enter the race if it did not collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would give her just $250.
"Do they think I should have a discount?" she wondered.
During the speech he announced that she would not start a formal campaign she was so overwhelmed by emotions, or thanks to the people who supported her, frustration from the system that made it so difficult to collect funds and target voters, not delegates and anger towards sexism, she began to cry.
"If you saw me you'd probably thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder of how the media reacted to the case.
"You'd think "Klinex" was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"She cried?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can be a good job for Beijing
The opening of the fire at the beginning of the US-China trade war was overwhelming, and although the battle is far from over, the conflict between countries can be useful for long-term Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, gave the first warning at the beginning of this year by exposing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The situation was significantly escalating during this week with the introduction of new tariffs for goods worth $200 billion (150 billion), making half of the goods coming from China effective.
Beijing returned in kind each time, or recently imposed tariffs from five to ten percent of American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to return to the United States with the same measure, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will give up the same in the near future.
To make Washington withdraw means to accept his demands, but public worship before the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, pressure from the US trade war can result in positive support for China on a long-term basis because the interdependence of the two economies will be reduced.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions to start a sudden economic downturn in any of the countries is much more dangerous than previously identified by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, which represents a tank tank.
Syria is "prepared" for returning refugees, foreign minister said
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild the country that has been devastated by the long war that lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, which is due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
Now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave due to terrorism and unilaterally introduced economic measures that reflected their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomes aid in the reconstruction of the desolate country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe has achieved a significant victory of the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's team beat the US team in Ryder's 2018 Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row of European courts and has not won the title of Ryder's European Cup since 1993.
Europe has regained its grip since Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points that were needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mikelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, at his first hole hit the ball in the water in pairs-3 of the 16th hole, losing Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari pointed out in all circles, with one of the four players that achieved the result 5-0-0 after the tournament started to be organized in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost 5-4 of the lowest ranking European team player, Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest ranking player lost 2 and 1 of Ian Paulter from England, which may have been the last time he played the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant in eight Ryder Cups, became the European who won the most titled tournament with 25.5 points during his career.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't stop.
This year was really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so glad we got our title back.
Team game is the most important and I am happy to be able to help," emotional Garcia said after the victory of Europe.
He now resigns his son-in-law John Ram, who won Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, on Sunday, with the result of 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud of winning Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at him as a game," 23-year-old Ram said.
Woods lost in all four competitions in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's about amazing statistics of one of the best players of all time, which won 14 great titles, ranking by Jack Niklaus.
The US team all weekend was trying to focus the game on low grass fields, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high quality golf throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furik after his disappointing game said "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
At one point in the morning, we put the team in trouble for Europe.
We were fighting.
He's digging down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Association of Professional Golfers and our Committee on the Ryder Cup and we'll continue.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it.
They beat us.
