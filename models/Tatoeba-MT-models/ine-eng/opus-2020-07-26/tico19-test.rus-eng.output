The rapidly increasing rate of cumulative coronary infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and in the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The cumulative coronary infection disease (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, thus confirming that despite the various stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly growing in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive therapy offices, it is necessary to increase the level of readiness for patients with COPID-19 who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive therapy.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of pneumonia disease of unknown etiology were recorded in Uhan Hubay Province of China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of coronal virus, currently known as a type 2 severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2), was the source of the infection.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called a coronary infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, about 80 per cent of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e., respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, and most of the patients are cured.
Approximately 14 per cent of the COVID-19 cases are developing a more severe form of hospitalization, while the remaining 6 per cent are taking a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
The study analyzes and compares the trends in COVID-19 cumulative disease in each country of the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in the United Kingdom.
We are also comparing the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom with data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom
Since the outbreak in China, the COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing in the same way as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiterie (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease in Europe that met the WHO criteria for disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on 24 January 2020 and all three were returned from the Hubay Province of China.
As at 15 March 2020, the cases of infection with COVID-19 were identified in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, with 39 768 cases of infection and 1,727 deaths, of which 17,750, including 1,441 fatalities, were recorded for the period from 31 December 2019 to that date.
Determination of cumulative amount and cumulative disease COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) daily updates data on the number of recorded cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
This data is used to analyse trends in the prevalence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom and for comparison with data on Italy.
The COVID-19 cumulative disease was estimated to be a 14-day COVID-19 prevalence rate in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 p.m. on 15 March 2020 compared with data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in the development of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Trends in COVID-19 in the 14-day period in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom generally corresponded to trends observed in the Province of Hubey in China (Figure 1).
The cumulative disease of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom generally began to grow about 21 February, and a sharp leap of this rate occurred on 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to a rapid increase in the number of registered disease cases in Italy, but similar trends were observed in all other EU/EEA countries and in Britain to increase the cumulative disease of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows a cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 diseases in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom as compared to a similar figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already registered as at 8:00 p.m. in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom is comparable to the number recorded in Italy about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 recorded cases in the EU/EEA and in Britain.
The observed trends in COVID-19 cumulative disease suggest that pandemics are developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite different stages in different countries, differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of disease cases and different rules for the selection of patients for the analysis of the availability of COVID-19, including “declaring” testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 require intensive therapy, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care offices in these regions have already been fully filled.
Currently, data on the incidence of COPID-19 patients in the hospital and/or intensification therapy offices in the EU/EEA are available only for 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (the data are not available).
However, a systematic collection of such data should be carried out to supplement current monitoring data, the number of recorded cases and the number of deaths.
According to a study conducted in 2010-2011, Europe has a significant spread in the number of cats in intensive therapy and in intensive care offices: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive therapy and intensive care offices for 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
The 6th updated ECDC report on the outcome of the COVID-19 risk assessment presents scenarios for the loading of health systems with estimated hospitalization data for COVID-19 infected in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, where the risk of lack of available coke in intensive therapy offices exceeds 90 per cent.
As the cases are currently grouped into certain EU/EEA regions and the United Kingdom, hospitals and intensive care offices are usually serviced by the population of a particular territorial group, information on cases of infection and the number of cats in intensive care offices is recommended to provide data on the 2nd level of territorial unit nomenclature for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and Britain.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2, a long-term non-satisfaction, and for an increase in the number of patients with COPID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive treatment, which can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on the results of the risk assessment, the importance of preventing the spread of SARS-COV-2 is an operational, preventive and integrated approach with a subsequent shift from mitigation to minimization, since, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases for decision-makers and hospitals, it may not be enough time to consider, adopt and adjust their response accordingly, unless such measures are taken in advance.
The report on the results of the risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a small period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If not, in the next few days or weeks of the health system in other EU/EEA countries, patients who will need intensive therapy will be confronted with flood.
The outbreak of the 2019 coronary infection (COVID-19) caused by severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) of type 2 (SARS-COV-2) has become a tragedy for mankind: more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries of the world, and 80,000 have been infected.
Like the homologous SARS-CoV virus, which caused the development of a severe severe respiratory syndrome in thousands in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from flying mice and caused similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is a lower severity and lower mortality than SARS, but it is much more infected and affects older people more often than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of new disease publications, this article proposes an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing subject of the study.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virological, diagnostics, treatment, forecasting further flow and prevention of this disease.
While the answers to many questions still need to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the dangerous disease.
The spring holiday (China's New Year), which fell on 25 January 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese who were urged to stay home for the whole holiday and many weeks after the outbreak of the new virus.
In view of the high level of coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) called this virus SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease of coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Uhan and spread rapidly throughout the country and then in almost 50 other countries of the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases were detected, more than 40,000 patients recovered, and more than 3,000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “an enemy number one for society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), less than two months later, more than 200 COVID-19 publications, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, were published, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly developing material area.
As far as possible, we are trying to compare the COVID-19 with SARS and the other coronavirus disease, the coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss known facts about the prevention and forecasting of the flow of the disease, as well as some other issues that are not least pressing.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been among pathogens that are not fatal to humans and are mainly responsible for about 15 per cent of general respiratory diseases 4.
However, in this century, we have faced two times with highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, i.e. severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2) and close-east respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV), which caused the outbreak of diseases in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other States with a horrifying severity of disease and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of a coronary infection in the history of mankind.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the report on the clusteres of cases of unknown pneumonia was first submitted to the National Health Commission of the PRC from Uhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
The first death case was registered on 15 January 2020 in Uhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly in neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the infection of medicated workers became known, thus suggesting the possibility of transmission of a human virus.
On 23 January, a quarantine was introduced in Uhan, ending urban public transport.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of this disease, 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed coronary infection had direct contact with the market for marine products in Uhanan, which was considered to be the starting point for the spread of infection from unknown animals.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of coronavirus was a global emergency in the field of public health.
At the time of the preparation of the report, the disease spread throughout China and had already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
In view of the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and the degree of danger of the outbreak still need to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COPID-19, presented the following updated epidemic development picture (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bdA).
All age groups were infected with SARS-CoV-2, but were mainly sick at the age of 30 to 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years old, quite few were under 20, and only 14 had not yet reached 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infection in men above (0.31/100 000) than in women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was distributed by clusteres mainly in the province of Hubei and in the neighbouring regions.
On average, 5 (2-9) days were observed from the time of occurrence of COPID-19 symptoms to diagnosis.
The incubation period was on average 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
From the time of onset of symptoms until death, on average, 9.5 (4.8–13) days were observed.
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
As of 23 January 2020, an exponential increase was made in the number of people infected with large-scale transport operations prior to the Chinese New Year.
The mortality rate among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44 per cent (95% CI: 1.10–1.86 per cent), and the patient mortality rate was 3.06 per cent (95% CI: 2.02–4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large shell viruses containing one network of meaningful RNAs.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and deltas, of which alpha- and beta-conaviruses are known to attack people.
In the event of a stroke of type SARS and MERS glycoprotein invertebrates (S) is associated with cell receptors of type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptideylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
In cytoplasm, the virus RNA is released; after replication of the virus genome, the gene RNA, together with shelled glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins, generates virion-containing compounds that then merge with the membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the genomic sequence of SARS-COV-2 appeared on 10 January 2020.
It was established that SARS-CoV-2 was a new type of betachoronavirus, with a gene of 99.98 per cent corresponding to 10 sequence samples collected in the first outbreak of the disease in the Juanan marine product market in Huhanan.
Genetically SARS-COV-2 is closer to SARS-COV than to MERS-COV.
With the help of an e-micro-microcopy of the SARS-CoV-2 particles, a human respiratory hospital was found in ultrasonic circuits.
It has been established that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-COV-2 is associated with ACE2 human enzyme less than in SARS-COV, which explains the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes patients to have a less severe disease than SARS-COV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate previously unknown short-lived orf3b and secretified orf8.
The lock of the SARS-CoV-2 virus orf3b can play some role in the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a collection of authors in the head of Zjou (Zhou) presented reports on the cryo-electronic tomography of the structure of the full scale human ACE2 farm with 2.9 Å in a complex with a B0AT1 tank carrier.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed formations, was collected as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S proteins, which was evidenced by the identification and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target when carrying out a medication box to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate owner
It is known that the source and SARS-COV, and MERS-COV were flying mice, from which the virus was transmitted to the human through the cubs and vertebrates respectively.
Through the phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was found that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 are flying mice, since the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what kind of temporary owner it has become, which has enabled the virus to overcome the type barrier and to infect the human; the route of transmission is also still to be identified.
Mr. Czy (Ji) and colleagues suggested that the virus carriers from flying mice to humans had become snakes, during which homologous recombination took place in S-protein.
As a result of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that the pangolines, long-term dairy, which are fed by ants and which are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99-percent genetic relationship between the pangoline coronary virus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference in 1 per cent between the two genomes is very large, so it is considered that the final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-COV-2 are largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions SARS-COV and MERS-COV may survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and for up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40 to 50 % of moisture.
SARS-COV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heating up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; effective blocking of the virus activity may be air, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlorinated disinfectants, percussion acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorohexidine.
The human population in general does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There are currently no data on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-COV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, particularly SARS-COV and MERS-COV (Figure 4).
As a rule, the virus entering the host's body will first recognize the implanted immune system through the imaging receptors (ORRs), including the S-type receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus induces the expression of the ignition factors, the formation of dendrite cells and the synthesis of Type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages with regard to viral antigens.
However, the N-label SARS-COV can avoid immune reactions.
Adaptive immune response is soon involved in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-affected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help defense cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by causing their programmable death.
Humorative immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies separated from the healthy patient neutralized the Mers-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperresponse of the immune system involves local education of a large number of free radicals, which may cause serious damage to the light and other organs, and in the worst scenario, to polyorganic deficiency and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestations, is more likely to affect elderly people with concomitant pathologies and pregnant women.
The possibility of infection is higher for people who are affected by a large number of viruses or who have immunodeficiency.
According to an analysis of the first 425 cases of infection in Uhanan, the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was averaged for 3 days, with a distribution of between 0 and 24 days.
The study described above, based on population data in 8 866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the time limit for quarantine measures, taking into account the most accurate estimates of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected with the disease that is inescapably occurring.
In general, 14-day quarantine has become available for people who have contacts with the virus or who are infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptoms of COVID-19 are often high temperatures, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty in breathing, muscle pain, headache, throat pain, dizziness, chest pain, diarrhoea, coughing and redness.
In some patients, search and/or hypoxia were observed a week after the onset of the disease.
Severe cases of disease have rapidly progressed, and patients have developed severe respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acid and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperature and/or respiratory disease symptoms and acute disease should be tested for virus to detect early diagnosis even in the absence of pathologies in the pictures of the chest.
The demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following symptoms: 98% high temperature, 76% dry cough, 55% fever and 3% diarrhoea; 8% patients required light artificial ventilation.
Similar results were obtained as a result of the last two studies in cases of infection in the family and the transmission of the virus from unsymptomatic infected individuals.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high (98 per cent), dry cough (47 per cent) and search (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent of them were required for light artificial ventilation, which was much higher than in COPID-19 patients, and was higher in mortality than in COPID-19.
Diarrhoea (26 per cent) and throat pain (21 per cent) were also observed in patients with MERS.
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperatures (99 to 100 %), dry cough (29 to 75 %), swelling (40 to 42 %), diarrhoea (20 to 25 %) and throat pain (13 to 25 %), and light artificial ventilation is required 14 to 20 % of patients.
As of 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2 per cent and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Compared to this, the death rate from SARS to November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a population study conducted in June 2012 showed mortality at 37 per cent of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
As a result of an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was defined at 6.47 at 95% confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, whereas R0 for SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERCS-COV and SARA-COV on symptoms, mortality levels and R0 are shown in Table 1.1.
The above indicators show that SARS-COV-2 is higher than the MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but the level of mortality in the case of a new virus is below the last two.
Thus, maintaining the SARS-COV-2 epidemic would be much more difficult than the MERS-COV and SARS-COV epidemics.
The classical manifestation is often caused by an infection within one family or group of people who have gathered together for some reason or who have come together in some transport, such as a cruise liner.
Patients often traveled to Mr. Uhan or other affected regions, lived there or contacted the infected or sick for the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people may be virus carriers without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who have been removed from the hospital may again become virus carriers, and this is a alarming signal for the length of quarantine.
At an early stage, patients had normal or reduced number of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COPID-19 had leukocyte lymphopaenia < 4×109/L, including leukocytes < 1×109/L, as well as elevated asparagin aminotransferase and virusaemia.
In some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were found in the blood, and in most patients, elevated levels of C-reactive protein were observed and erythrocytes were found in the blood.
In patients with severe disease D-dimmer, the fibrin-depleting product in the blood was increased and the number of lymphocytes continued to decrease.
Most COPID-19 patients in the X-ray study of the breast cell were diagnosed with pathologies characterized by uneven darkness from both sides or light “mother glass” darkness.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe mild injury, and severe respiratory disease.
In developing POPs, uncontrollable combustion, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant gas exchange breach.
The disfunction of Type I and Type II tyres lowers the level of surface-active compounds and increases the surface pressure, thereby reducing the ability of light to expand and increase the risk of light drop.
Thus, the worst results of X-ray studies often coincide with the most serious cases of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the detection of pneumonia, the formation of gyline membranes and intersonic lymphocyte infiltrating, and the multi-nuclear synthetic cells in light patients who died of disease correspond to viral infections and ORAs and similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the method of detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA was used through a polymeric chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase).
However, given the high level of false negative results that may accelerate the epidemic development, China has started to diagnose on the basis of clinical manifestations since 13 February 2020 (no longer relying solely on the reverse transcriptase PCR).
It was a similar situation with SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, effective diagnosis is critical and data on the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray results need to be compiled.
On 14 February 2020, a group of experts led by Mr. Feng Zhang described the SHERLOCK-based methodology protocol for the detection of SARS-COV-2; this method allows the identification of synthetic RNAs SARS-COV-2 with a density of 20 × 10–18 mol/l to 200 × 10–18 mol/l (10–100 copies per microlitre of the baseline) with indicators less than once without the use of complex equipment.
This new method, if tested successfully on clinical medicinal products, can significantly improve the sensitivity and ease of testing.
Due to the lack of experience in the treatment of previously unknown coronary viruses, physicians may, in general, provide only supportive treatment to patients with COVID-19 while trying to apply any therapeutic methods used or proposed for the treatment of other coronary viruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antivirals, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasmas of cured patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even plasma should be used in cured patients.
Pharmaceutical companies are about to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly light, and may at least affect other organs expressing ACE2, such as pelvic tract and pouch.
However, the violation of work and the refusal of the breathing organs are the main threat and cause of patient death.
Therefore, support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation of light persons, is critical.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified method of extrapulmonary circulation used to treat a life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining the water balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as protecting the functions of vital organs, is essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
The cytokine storm is known to be the result of the hyperreaction of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
The cytokine storm is a form of a systemic combustion process that develops in response to a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate the immunosuppression of a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of POPs and polyorganic insufficiency.
In the treatment of cytokine fever, especially in patients in severe conditions, immunosuppression is essential.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies serving as an interlequinase-6 inhibitor were used to treat cytokine fever.
Other methods of treating cytokine storms based on immunosuppression include modulation of the immune response to T-cell control; blocking the production of cytokines IFN-g, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of yanus-kinase; the use of blinatumumab, cytokine-signal suppressors 4 and hytondeacetase-asease inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of inflammatory processes when treating SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immunosuppressors.
However, high-dose steroids do not benefit from the treatment of severe mild injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially auscullar osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the forecast.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended to be used with caution when treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
There is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy at the time of the preparation of this document.
However, the internal introduction of remedesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was effective in treating the American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a recently developed antiviral drug, originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of Ebola- and Marburg-based diseases.
Later, remedesivir also demonstrated the possibility of suppression of other viruses with a one-off RNA, including the Mers and SARS viruses.
Based on these data, Gilead has provided this medicine to China for peer studies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are awaiting impatience.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were proposed as possible options for the treatment of patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, dizziness, redness, hepatic impairment and other side effects.
The interaction of these medicinal products with other medicinal products designated for patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and anti-inflammatory products
Blood collection in infected patients has long been used to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect the health of the population.
In fact, the blood of healthy patients often contains relatively high levels of antibodies to fight pathogens.
The antibodies are in immunoglobulin, produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and neutralize them.
Based on this requirement, plasma was derived from blood samples of the group of patients treated with COVID-19, which was then introduced by 10 severely ill patients.
During 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the severity of inflammation and viral load decreased, and the blood saturation of oxygen increased.
However, in order to suggest that the method be applied to the mass before a specific therapy is conducted, an untested and unexplained review is still required.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effect, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully investigated.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune system and cause cytokine emission syndrome, which, given its toxicity, poses a potential risk to life.
Blood antibodies are usually low, and plasmas for treatment in critical condition are very much required.
It is not easy to develop and manufacture specific antibodies quickly enough to address the global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and more practical to assign B cells to healthy patients and to identify the genetic code of effective antibodies or to carry out a screening to find effective antibodies against critically important proteins of the virus.
So we can go straight to the mass production of antibodies.
The Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on the combination of many components of the formula, which is different from the diagnosis of the disease based on Chinese traditional medicine theories.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have unspecified effects, as the design and verification of these components or their optimal combination seems difficult.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific treatment of COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatment methods for patients with mild and moderate severity of symptoms or for patients who recover from a severe disease.
For example, Shu Feng Cze Du capsules (Shu Feng Je Du) and Lian Hua Cin Wen capsules (Lian Hua Qing Wen) have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest proportion of healthy patients with COVID-19 was observed in a number of Chinese provinces, where Chinese traditional medicine was used in 87 per cent of patients treated, including in Ghana (63.7%), Ninze (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in the province of Hubei, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for treatment only in approximately 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19, the lowest percentage of healthy (13 per cent) was recorded.
However, this is a rather rough comparison, as the assessment should take into account the number of other factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published the study materials, which compared treatment only with Western medicine and combined treatment with Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the time-limits for normalization of body temperature, symptoms and hospital medical care were significantly lower in patients treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in patients treated with Western methods alone.
The most surprising fact is that the proportion of patients who started to develop symptoms (from mild to severe) was seen below in a group treated by combining Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods than in a group treated only by Western methods (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent), and mortality in the first group was lower than in the second group (8.8 per cent compared to 39 per cent).
However, the effectiveness and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still require more closely controlled research carried out in more and more regions.
It is also of interest to obtain, as soon as possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the aspects of the effectiveness of the components used in or in combination with Chinese traditional medicine.
Patients who suspect or confirmed the existence of COVID-19 are mainly in a strong fear of acute and even fatal disease, while quarantined people are also in a state of shock, loneliness and extreme anger.
In addition, infections such as nausea, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as lack of corticosteroids, may cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
Early outbreaks of the SARS virus reported a number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor onset, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicide.
Compulsory monitoring of contacts and quarantines, including measures taken by health authorities to prevent the COVID-19 epidemic, may increase people's concern and guilt over the spread of infection, quarantine and social glue on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COPID-19, suspected and contacted, as well as to all others required.
In the context of psychological support, multidisciplinary psychiatric assistance teams should be formed, providing clear information with regular and accurate updating of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans and using professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in stopping the transmission chain from vectors of infection and infected people to susceptible owners and are often used in addition to anti-virus therapy used to prevent new viruses.
Work on the establishment of S-protein-based vaccines was carried out to produce long-term and high-acting neutralising antibodies and/or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal studies have developed live weakened SARS vaccines.
However, prior to clinical trials, the effectiveness of these possible vaccines should be further determined in the natural environment when used in elderly patients, the pattern of deadly dose infection and the level of protection against infection with zoonose viruses.
Perhaps the reason is that SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and since then no new case has been reported.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusteres of disease caused by the Mers virus in the Middle East and spread to other regions continue to occur through the preservation of zoonotic sources in the endemic habitat areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed to combat mers, using inactivated virus, plasma DNA, virus vectors, nanoparticles, viral particles and components of recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for individuals with no immunity is an urgent and critical challenge that requires a solution to prevent the epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long-term (mean 18 months) required for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic development of coronary viruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a full picture of the clinical flow of the disease from thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without difficulty.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
Therefore, it is critical for health authorities to establish a forecasting disease model to identify the priority of their action, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on current clinical studies, the following factors may affect or be associated with the forecasting of disease in patients with COPID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the flow of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between 30 and 65 years of age, 47.7 per cent of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the study mentioned above, 8 866 cases.
Patients who were required for intensive therapy were more likely to have baseline diseases and complications and were significantly older than those who were not required for such therapy (mean 66 years versus 51 years), which showed that age was a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection in men above (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Sickness and difficulty: patients with COPID-19 who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop severe myocardial infarction and arrhythmia.
Cardiological events were also the main cause of the death of patients with SARS.
It was also reported that SARS-COV-2 could also be associated with positive ACE2 holangiocytes, which could cause liver failure in patients with COPID-19.
It should be noted that age and baseline diseases are closely interlinked and may distort results.
The abnormalities identified in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage and is proposed to be considered as a potential predictive factor for the flow of the disease, the response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the level of C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease and the predictiveness of COVID-19.
In addition, an increase in lactate dehydrogenase, asparagin-aminotransferase, alanine-aminotransferase and creatine kinase may be predicted.
These enzymes are distributed in large quantities by various organs, especially heart and liver, and their emissions occur when the tissues are damaged.
They are therefore traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: X-ray data on the chest cell and development of clinical symptoms over time should be considered in order to predict the results and complications of treatment with COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants widely used in infectious diseases as additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
As corticosteroids have been widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the diseases have developed osteonecrosis that causes life-threatening disabilities and low quality of life.
Therefore, if steroids are to be used to treat COPID-19 patients, these medicinal products should be administered at small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, many patients suffer from unexpected severe stress in the background of the COVID-19 epidemic, as they often have to endure long quarantine periods, cope with high uncertainty and monitor the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
To relieve stress in such patients and help them return to normal life, psychological consultation and long-term support must be conducted.
According to demographic studies, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to exposure to low respiratory pathways, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as other coronary viruses that cause common cold diseases, can be successfully propagated in upper respiratory pathways and cause mild symptoms or not at all symptoms at the early stages of infection.
Therefore, patients with an early disease stage or who have not yet completed the incubation period may, through their normal life, spread the virus to a significant extent, which significantly hampers epidemiological control.
However, the transmission of SARS-COV virus was considered to occur when patients were severely ill, most of which did not occur at the early stages of the infection.
Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control.
China is currently doing a major work, which has announced a global quarantine in Uhan and neighbouring cities, as well as an extended quarantine regime for almost the entire population in order to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
While these measures have a significant economic and other areas of life in the country, the number of new patients identified has decreased, thus slowing the spread of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak of the disease will end in March and the drought phase will extend from 3 to 4 months.
Some experts, however, are less optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Hunter) and his colleagues took the view that the COVID-19 outbreak, which is much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) formed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and assumed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could hit two thirds of the world ' s population.
The group of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in nose and throat cancers taken in patients who recovered and were hospitalized two weeks earlier, indicating that a new virus could become a cyclical influenza similar to influenza.
However, a reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the current strategy may have had an effect.
According to the original projections, Ebola’s disease had to be inflicted on up to a million people and caused the death of half a million patients.
But by means of severe quarantine and insulating of diseases, it was finally possible to control.
It is likely that, like SARS-CoV virus, the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be weakened and over time it will disappear or become less pathogenic to the human being.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through cough or sneezing, as well as possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in the cage, which means that it is also possible to have an oral method of transmission.
According to one recent study, 41 per cent of 138 patients may have been infected in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 patients with disease.
Therefore, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even foreign patients.
The first line of defense for reducing the risk of infection is the wearing of masks for the person; and surgical masks, and N95-type respirators ( series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not allow the micro-circuit of liquids from potentially infected to flow into the air and sit on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to the environment.
However, only N95 (Series No. 1860s) can protect against vibrations of 10 to 80 nm, they miss only 5 per cent of the virus; SARS-COV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-COV, and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks combined, medical workers directly contacting patients must wear N95 masks (series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical workers should wear a protective helmet mounted on the figure to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also fall into the body through the eye.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor infected SARS-COV-2 despite wearing a class N95 mask; the virus may have fallen into his body through the inflammation of the eyes.
Medical workers should therefore also wear transparent facial shields or protective eyes of a closed type.
It is strongly recommended that the entire population of affected or potentially threatened regions should be more commonly washed by mine disinfectants, not try to get out of the house by self-insulation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is considered to be about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to humanity, the high level of its similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, was to become a alarming signal to China, taking into account the experience they acquired during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020, the Director of the Centre for Disease Control in Uhanan calmed the citizens, stating that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproductiveity when transferring from human to human and that the prevention of the spread and control of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement significantly reduced social tension, especially during the time when the whole country was ready to celebrate the New Year of China, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be held within the limits of Mr. Uhanan with minimal losses.
China ' s health authorities can take this serious lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since every word is taken into account by citizens and may affect their attitude and decisions; (2) monitor and respond to unusual information coming from a clinic rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to curb the potential epidemic in the early stages of its development and not to calm the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective studies to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regular checks and improve the response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by previously unsolicited severe second-type severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2) started at the end of December 2019.
Less than two months later, the disease covered all of China and spread to 50 countries around the world at the time of its preparation.
Because the virus is very similar to a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the symptoms of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), the feeling of SARS resuscitation occurred at the outbreak of COVID-19.
However, between COVID-19 and SARS there are some significant differences in the prevention of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of serious cases and the level of mortality among older people is also higher than among young people.
Mortality resulting from SARS is higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is unsymptomatic, while patients with SARS are usually infected only in severe cases, thus preventing the spread of COVID-19 is more difficult than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-COV-2 is distributed much faster and larger than SARS-COV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative conventional samples available for SARS-COV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, patients who have been treated may again show positive samples of the virus.
All of this significantly increases the risk of virus proliferation.
In the light of such rapid progress in the COVID-19 studies, some key issues remain to be addressed, namely:
What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2?
Despite the discovery of a 96-percent homologous between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses by flying mice, we still cannot claim that the SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred by flying mice.
What animal became an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original owner, such as flying mice, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we can't really stop the transfer path, and the epidemiological situation can get worse at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, but how exactly is the virus introduced into respiratory tract cells and caused subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic continue?
How does the virus evolve genetically in the process of human transfer?
Will it be the cause of the world pandemic, will it also disappear like SARS or will it periodically relapse like flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the coevolution of coronaviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including people, for thousands of years.
By 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCOV) were known to cause a mild disease, such as normal cold.
The outbreaks of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how devastating and life-threatening human coronary disease can be.
The occurrence of a severe type 2 severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 has refocused on the coronary viruses and surprised us with high transmission, but less pathogenicity of the virus than the SARS-CoV family virus.
Coronavirus human infection is zoonose, and understanding of its origin will be very useful.
Most human coronaviruses come from flying mice for which they are not pathogens.
There are also known intermediate reservoirs of some human coronaviruses.
The identification of animals directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
A study of the interaction of animals that carry coronaviruses can also shed light on the pathogen of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we provide data on the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery and their zoonotic origin and methods of intervising.
It is important to note that we compare and compare various human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, today's epidemic of coronary disease, found in 2019 (COVID-19), is also being addressed.
In addition, the conditions required for the successful replacement of carriers are noted and the effect of the virus on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of vertebral viruses with one positive-polar RNA.
These viruses, with the largest number of RNA-containing viruses in the genome of between 26 and 32,000 nucleotides, have been named because of their form that reminds the corona when examined under the electronic microscope.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with an identical organization.
About two thirds of the genomes contain two large open partially overcrowded accounting frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are transmitted to the polyproteins of the pp1a and pp1ab replicas.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins marked nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains an open calculation framework for structured proteins, including chipper protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other lines of coronavirus also coded a number of line-specific accessory proteins.
Based on differences in the sequences of proteins\ coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha, beta, gamma, and deltacoronaviruses), including most human coronaviruses (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the majority of alpha and betachoronaviruses are flying mice and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and deltachoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have been constantly overcoming interstellar barriers, and some of them have evolved into dangerous pathogens for humans.
Today, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include human alphacoronaviruses HCV-229E and HCV-NL63.
The other five beta-coronaviruses include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), near-east respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) and severe severe respiratory syndrome type 2 SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of mild form, such as cold and/or diarrhoea.
Unlike these, SARS-CoV, Mers-CoV viruses and recently detected SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe infections of lower respiratory pathways in a relatively higher number of patients with a higher risk of developing severe respiratory disease (ORS) and onset of extraneous symptoms.
The first human coronavirus network of HCV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample of patients who were cold-fed in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive studies have provided more detailed information on HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 viruses, which cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a common concept that the human coronary infection was generally considered harmless.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in the current history; more than 8,000 people were affected and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic in the Arab Peninsula, and the disease spread dramatically to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) found in 2019 was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2 as a source of the current epidemic of coonavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which had more than 3,120 lives as at 3 March 2020, and the number of people infected had exceeded 91,000.
The alarmed signal is received, and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-COV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have zoonotic origin, are sources of flying mice, mice or domestic animals.
Many data sets show the benefits of the evolution of all human coronaviruses from flying mice, to which viruses have adapted well and in which they do not exhibit pathogenic properties, but demonstrate a wide variety of genetics.
The COVID-19 epidemic has left China and the world with serious health, scientific, social and moral challenges.
A study of the zoonotic mechanism of the origin of human coronaviruses will enable them to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting intervisal transmission.
It may also indicate or accelerate the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifier carrier SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the recurrence of disease in the future.
This review contains general information on zoonotic origin, intervisal transmission and human coronary pathogens.
In particular, we identify and consider the following general feature: the baseline viruses from which human coronary viruses have occurred are not usually pathogens for their reservoirs, but acquire pathogens after the intervisal transmission to the new carrier.
We are also analysing the trend in the evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogens.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also being considered.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the strain B814 of the HCV-229E virus was first obtained from a sample separated from the bone marrow of patients with cold disease, different coronary viruses were found in various infected animals, including the indexes, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
Table 1 provides a brief history of the finding of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with infection of the upper respiratory tract in 1966; the virus was further adapted to the reproduction of WI-38 laying cells.
Patients infected with HCV-229E had mild symptoms, including headache, vomiting, general malaise and throat pain, while high temperatures and cough were observed in 10 to 20 per cent of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 virus was derived from the organic culture and subsequent serial passage in the brain of mouse conjunctivities.
The clinical signs of HCV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCV-229E virus infection, whose symptoms differ from those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A and Rinovirus viruses.
Both the HCV-229E virus and the HCV-OC43 virus are widely distributed worldwide and are usually transmitted in winter at moderate intervals.
The main incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of disease.
According to the study of volunteers, healthy people infected with HCV-229E have developed a normal cold in light form.
Only a few patients with weak immunity had severe respiratory tract infections.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the Atypical Pneumonia epidemic, has become the first documented pandemic of humanity, caused by human coronary disease, and the virus SARS-CoV, the third of the human coronavirus detected.
The first case of SARS was detected at the end of 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdun.
During the SARS epidemic, 8 096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented and the disease spread in many countries and on various continents.
Without considering the super-active distributors, it was estimated that each patient could be infected by about two more persons; the incubation period was 4 to 7 days, and the viral load peak occurred on the 10th day of the disease.
In patients infected with SARS-COV, muscle pain, headaches, high temperature, general malaise and dizziness were initially reported, and later symptoms included swelling, cough and respiratory failure.
The prevalence of laboratory deviations from the SARS standard is lymphopenia, liver abnormalities and elevated creatinine levels.
Patients with SARS also experienced diffuse alveolar injury, proliferation of epithelial cells, and increased macrophages.
Some 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive therapy and light mechanical ventilation.
In such severe cases, in addition to lower respiratory pathways, other organs may also be infected, including gastrointestinal tract organs, liver and thighs, which are usually accompanied by a cytokine fever that can be fatal, especially for patients with impaired immunity.
For the first time, the virus was removed from the open biopsy of a mild relative who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, tremendous efforts have been made to study human coronary viruses.
At the end of 2004, HCV-NL63 was granted to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
Initially, it was found that it was mainly affecting children of younger age, elderly people and patients with impaired immunity and respiratory diseases.
For the disease caused by HCV-NL63, events such as dizziness, conjunctivitis, high temperature and broncholith are characteristic.
Another independent study describes the same virus from the native material taken by an 8-month-old male from the Netherlands who suffers from pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but in fact it spread everywhere.
It is estimated that HCV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases, and the peaks of their disease are at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 binds to an obstructive laryngitis, which is also called a crust.
HCOV-HKU1 was granted in Hong Kong in the same year by a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and broncholith.
In addition to insomnia and bronchiolitis, HCV-HKU1 is associated with increased asthma disease.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 virus, which causes respiratory diseases in mild form, have been detected worldwide.
All these four human coronary viruses, which cause extracurricular infections, have been well adapted to people, and their mutations, resulting in highly pathogenic diseases, are generally unlikely, although their causes were unknown, as in a rare case with a more virulent subtype of HCV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has caused a serious infection of lower respiratory pathways in China.
Usually, by acquiring the ability to transmit and maintain effectively into the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
Coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first awarded in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from a mild 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and initial insufficiency.
Most laboratoryly confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, road accidents and outbreaks have been recorded through epidemic secondary infections in close contact.
Another second blast with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) remind of symptoms of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) — both infections are characterized by advanced acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed a severe initial failure, which still distinguishes MERS from the other diseases caused by human-transmitting coronary viruses.
More than 30 per cent of patients have symptoms of jaundice, such as diarrhoea and redness.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratoryly confirmed cases of high-death respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (34.4%) have been recorded, and Mers-Cov is considered to be one of the most deadly viruses known to man.
From mid to the end of December 2019, in Uhana Province of Hubey, patients with pneumonia were identified, which is now seen in the past as related to the infection caused by severe severe type 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the continuing outbreak of low respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global emergency in the field of public health, and the disease itself has been referred to as “coronavirus infection 19” (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases were registered worldwide, with mortality being approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2 per cent and 1.2 per cent abroad.
SARS-CoV-2, similar to SARS and MERS, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by an increase in temperature, cough and swelling.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to rapidly enter acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarities between SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses, however, form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-COV-2 is clearly less pathogenic, but has greater transmission capacity than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Cases of unsymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been recorded, indicating the ability of this virus to spread rapidly around the world.
As a result of the comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other six human coronaviruses, important similarities and differences are identified.
First, coronavirus transmissions have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease they cause.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the rest of the six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coronary viruses causing extra-patient infections (e.g. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections are similar to those that are most commonly observed in human coronary infections causing extra-sick infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-COV infection, a small subset of serious cases of COVID-19 can be identified, although the ratio is slightly below.
Thirdly, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also includes interesting legal features, both for human coronaviruses causing infective infections and for SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as human coronary viruses causing extra-sick infections.
On the other hand, it is still necessary to check whether the transmission of SARS-COV-2 with each subsequent virus transition (i.e. infection of each next person) is reduced, as in the SARS-COV and MERS-COV cases.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause infectious infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the specimens of kala.
We still have to answer the question of whether the faecal-oral route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
The issue of the possible SARS-CoV-2 season is also of particular interest to human coronaviruses that cause infectious infections.
However, the future development of the continuing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-COV-2, including transmission, pathogenity and sustainable distribution following human transition.
All four human coronaviruses that cause extra-sick infections with symptoms of mild form have been well adapted to people.
On the other hand, they may well have adapted to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both those and others could be called the only survivors after the pandemics of human coronary viruses in the past.
Human coronaviruses that cause serious diseases in humans, and people in whom human coronaviruses cause serious diseases simply did not survive.
In order for this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in the human body to a sufficient extent to produce adaptive mutations that are contrary to the carrier ' s limitation factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 blast will be extended and the more people will be infected, the more likely the virus will be fully adapted to the human being.
If it is well adapted, its transfer to people will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other control activities.
For many years, four outpatient coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing a normal cold in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require an animal reserve.
The highly pathogenic coronal viruses SARS-COV and MERS-COV have not adapted to a person sufficiently well, and their transfer to humans cannot be supported.
They need to remain and reproduce in their zoos and seek a case of falling into susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.
SARS-COV-2 has drawings similar to SARS-COV/MERS-COV, and four HCV-inflammatory viruses.
It is very easy to pass on, at least at the present time, as an incapacitating HCV.
But he's more pathogen than insomniac HCV, and less pathogen than SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to the human being and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the origin of HCV viruses, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutional, natural, intermediate, reinforcing and reserve carriers of HCV viruses.
The animal serves as the evolutionary carrier of HCV if it carries a progenitor with the same high homology at the level of the sequence of nucleotides.
The previous virus is usually well-adapted and unpathogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the carrier carries HCV continuously for a long time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCV or its parental virus.
In contrast, if HCV was only placed in the intermediate carrier directly before or about the time it was administered to a person, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and was often pathogen.
This intermediate carrier may serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifier by allowing the virus to be depleted and then transmitted to its people by increasing the level of human infection.
HPOV may carry a topical infection if it is unable to withstand intra-intermediate transmission.
On the contrary, HCV viruses can also be adapted to the intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data have shown retrospectively that a zero-patient SARS has been in contact with hunting animals (i.e.
Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-COV virus in animals is higher than in the population as a whole.
The Himalayan turtles (Paguma larvata) and the anonymised dog in the animal markets have become the first established vectors, similar and almost identical SARS-CoV.
This has been explicitly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all the loopholes in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan habitats living in nature or on farms and not on the market had not been determined in most cases that would lead to the conclusion that the Himalayan habitats could only serve as an intermediate booster rather than a natural SARS-CoV reservoir.
It is noteworthy that since 80 per cent of the different animals in the Guanzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility that intermediate enhancers may also serve many types of small dairy products cannot be excluded.
They all seem to be the stupid carrier of the SARS-COV virus.
Following the search for a natural animal carrier, SARS-CoV identified a native coV of flying mice, which was called atypical pneumonia-related coronavirus of HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and was present in Chinese flying mice.
These mice are positive for SARS-COV and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCOV HKU3.
These and other coronaviruses of flying mice account for between 88 and 92 per cent of the same homology of nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundations for a new concept that flying mice have become the carriers of new human pathogens.
Some SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been detected in flying mice, but none of them, except one that denotes WIV1, cannot be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that the SARS-CoV receptor is a human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1 obtained from a faecal flyer sample uses ACE2 flyers, jaws and humans as a receiver for entering the cell.
It is curious that the strains of healthy patients with SARS could neutralize HIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the closest family ancestor of SARS-CoV in flying mice, dividing 95 per cent of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, WIV1 is generally considered not to be a direct parental virus SARS-CoV, and flying mice are not a direct replacement carrier of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis refers to the same group as the CoV-HKU4 flyers and the CoV-HKU5 flyers.
CoV-HKU4 flyers and MERS-COV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptyldipeptidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The follow-up to the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerisation of the Mers-CoV virus is phylogenetically closer to the sequences of batacron viruses that have been detected in Europe and Africa.
So far, the wild-flying mice have not found a live Mers-CoV virus.
The MERS-CoV nuclear sequencing homology and its closest family of CoV-HKU25 flying mice correspond to only 87 per cent.
That is, flying mice could not be the direct replacement carrier of the Mers-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that unicorns are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as those of Middle East origin in many African countries.
A live MERS-COV, the human-detected virus, was derived from the native male male vertebrae, which further confirms the role of the vertebrae as the true meRS-COV reservoirs.
It should also be noted that the vertebrates that were experimentally infected with MERS-COV had minor symptoms, but a massive virus division.
It is noteworthy that the vectors infected not only provided the virus with a respiratory but also with a faecal oral route, which is also the main means of issuing the virus in flying mice.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome have not been in the history of contact with camels prior to symptoms and are likely to be related to human transfer or transmission by unknown channels, including unestablished species of animals that are the bearers of MERCS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide homology of 96.2% coincides with the CoV RatG13 flying mice assigned to the Asian subcoons of Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-COV and MERS-COV, the divergence between SARS-COV-2 and RatG13 is too large to attribute parental relations to them.
That is, flying mice could and could not be the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2 unless nearly identical coronaviruses of flying mice were found in the future.
It is assumed that direct animal carriers of SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Uchanian Eighth Market of Marine Products, which have been linked to many of the initial cases of COVID-19, indicating the likelihood of animal transfer.
Several recent studies, based on metagenoma sequencing, have found that a group of young people at risk of the destruction of small mammals known as pangoline (Manis javanica) was also able to carry a parent betachoronavirus, a family strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the sequences of these new pangoline coronavirus genes 85-92% coincides with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RatG13, with the identity of the nucleotide sequences being approximately 90 per cent.
They are classified in two lines of the differentiation of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which is a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with the same sequence of amino acids at a level of 97.4%.
On the contrary, RSD strains SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are more divergent, despite the higher degree of consistency across the genome.
The earlier study of pathogens also reported the identification of viral conditions in light samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, other methods of collection and manual processing were used to obtain the sequence of the genome, which included about 86.3 per cent of the full-scale viral genome.
It cannot be excluded that pangoline has become one of the intermediate animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-conaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangoline.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and betachoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution path SARS-CoV-2 in flying mice, pangolins and other dairy animals has not yet been established.
While the highest sequence homology was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-conaviruses of pangolines, relative SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13, the highest sequence homology across the genome.
The high degree of similarity between pangoline betachoronaviruses, family SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is highly theoretically related to parallel evolution through selectiveity.
The opposite proposal is for the recombination between the betachoronavirus pangoline, the family SARS-CoV-2, and RatG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, the recombination is widely distributed among betachoronaviruses.
There is still no final solution to the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCV viruses, the zoonotic origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 viruses is also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence shows that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E can be derived from coronaviruses of flying mice, while parental viruses of strains of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
The ARCoV.2 (Apalachian Ridge CoV) and discovered in the North American tricolored psoriasis has been reported to demonstrate a close relationship with the HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-229E is genetically related to another coronavirus of flying mice called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier could also be vertebrates.
For the sake of clarity, the modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarised in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of the events of the intervisal transmission of HCV in anamnesia.
When the HCOV-OC43 virus was transmitted in an intervised manner around 1890 and humans were infected with domestic animals, the pandemic of respiratory infection was registered.
The history of the HCV-229E inter-visual transmission is not so clear.
Alphaconaviruses of flying mice, near-family HCV-229E were detected.
There's an alphaconavirus in the alpaca.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from flying mice.
First of all, it's people, not alpaca, who could contact flying mice in a common environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alpacas.
Second, the alphaquinaviruses of flying mice, the family HCV-229E, are diverse and non-pathogenic in flying mice, while the alphaquinavirus of alpaca caused the onset of respiratory disease in infected animals.
After all, alphacronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Thus, the probability that the alphaquinavirus, the family HCV-229E, was received from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, flying mice are a direct source of human pathogens, including the virus of obesity, the virus of Ebola, the virus of Nipah and the virus of Hendra.
It is therefore not surprising that flying mice were able to transmit directly to people of HCV-229E.
On the other hand, while alphacoronaviruses of flying mice were able to serve as a gene pool of HCV-229E virus, alpacas and single-curves could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of the Mers-CoV virus.
MERS-COV serves as a fine example of intervising transmission from flying mice to single-curves and single-curves to human beings.
The evolution of the Mers-CoV virus from flying mice is known for its initial identification and was subsequently confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is obvious that flying mice provide a rich pool of viruses for intervisal exchange of gene fragments and intervisal transmission.
Long years, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and ability to fly make flying mice “ideal distributors”.
On the other hand, the Mers-Cov virus was introduced by a unicorn vector decades ago.
He adapted well to those camels who had become from the intermediate carrier a stable and natural reservoir carrier.
These animals have a very mild disease and have a relatively low rate of mutations.
Its episodic transfer to a person is an accident, and the person remains a stupid carrier of MERS-COV, since its transfer is not supported.
Unlike the role of vertebrates in the Mers-CoV transmission, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, pangoline betachoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in the pangoline.
They may be the neutral carriers of beta-cronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as strains in the SARS-CoV case.
In future studies it is necessary to confirm or delete several possibilities for the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals.
First, flying mice can be a replacement carrier for a SARS-CoV-2 family virus, almost identical SARS-CoV-2.
People can share an environmental niche with flying mice through the eyelids or the separation of their pets.
Second, the pangoline may be one of the intermediate boosters in which the SARS-COV-2 virus has recently been introduced.
People are infected with the virus through the separation of showers and the use of wild animals in food.
Many animals, including domestic animals, may be accepted by SARS-CoV-2.
The examination of domestic and wild animals on the antibody has been justified.
Third, the combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, as mentioned above, could occur in a third form, which has contacted both flying mice and pangolines.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-COV-2 continues.
In addition to different types of animal carriers, three major factors on the part of viruses also contributed to cross-border barriers.
First of all, they are relatively high-speed mutations in the RNA replication.
Compared to other viruses with one-off RNA, the estimated rate of coronary mutations can be considered “moderately high” with the average rate of replacement of approximately 10-4 per year in one section 2 according to the adaptation phase of the coronary virus to new owners.
Coronaviruses have an adjustment of exoribanuclease, which results in an extremely high rate of mutation and weakness or even incapacity.
It is interesting that the nucleotide analogue of Remdesivir suppresses the replication of coronavirus by inhibiting this exoribanuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising means against SARS-CoV-2 to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of coronary mutations is almost a million times higher than that of their carriers.
In addition, the frequency of mutations may often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-COV with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutations of SARS-COV-2 is shown below, indicating a higher level of adaptation to human beings.
The virus is supposed to have been adapted to another carrier close to the human being.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to Mers-CoV, which is well adapted to single camels.
Theoretically, vaccines and antivirals from SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to lose efficacy as a result of a genetic drive.
Secondly, the large RNA gene in the coronavirus leads to greater plasticity in the genomic modification of mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of intervisable coavolution conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.
This contributes to a number of unique open accounting frameworks and protein functions coded in the direction of the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, by means of a unique mechanism for selecting the matrix, coronaviruses randomly and often switch the matrix during the replication of the RNA.
During the transcription of the coronavirus DNA into the carrier, which serves as a compound vessel, a switch is often made.
High-sensitivity and subgenomable RNAs can combine and create new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43 and in animal coronaviruses such as SL-COV and batCoV-HKU9 flying mice.
Interaction of the virus-bearer with respect to transmission
In addition to the three factors listed above, the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor is another key factor that is important for inter-visual transmission.
In this article, as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in the event of inter-visual transmission, a recombination of SARS-CoV is provided.
On the basis of a comparative analysis between human SARS-COV strains and strains, SARS-COV is considered to be undergoing rapid adaptation in different carriers, especially with regard to mutations on RSD protein S.
In general, the RSD protein S coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor, and the antibody response is intensively chosen.
The SARS-CoV RSD is a human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (APF2) and its receptors.
The SARS-CoV virus RSD can be identified by the APF2 receptors of various animals, including mouse, civet, mouse and dogs, making it possible to intervise the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino-isolate residues were found in the RSD, which are different from human and cervical viral strains, with 4 of them in the binding receptor inducement for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in the RSD, which may increase the affinity of the spore protein interaction with the human receptor APF2.
In other words, these two substitutes can be particularly important for the adaptation of the virus to human beings.
It should be noted that SARS-COV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-COV.
The 30 per cent difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in the S1 protein S segment suggests that the binding affinity of the S protein to the human APF2 may have changed.
Indeed, a study using a cryoelectronic microscope says that the affinity of this relationship is 10 to 20 times higher than between APF2 human and S-virus SARS-CoV protein.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other receivers were required to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
It is remarkable that HCV-NL63 is also associated with APF2, but with another segment of protein S.
There are many other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCV-229E and 9-O-acetylsylic acid for HCV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses to humans after the intervisal transmission from animal carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the outcome of the intervisal transmission of HCV is also managed by other factors of dependence and carrier limitation.
The differentiation of these protein carriers between humans and the natural reserve carriers of HCVs, such as flying mice, unicorns and rodents, may constitute a barrier to intervisal transmission.
For the successful inter-visual transmission of HCV viruses, the dependency factors must be encouraged and the restrictions imposed on carriers.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can result in an impartial full-name screening of drivers' dependency and restrictions for SARS-CoV-2 through the latest CRISPR technology.
New HCV generation: back to zero mark
The variety of coronaviruses by flying mice provides a wide range of opportunities for new HCVs.
In this sense, coronaviruses flying mice serve as a genetic pool for HCV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force of the evolution of HCV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-encoding genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Of the SARS-COV accessories, ORF8 is considered important for human adaptation, as viruses of flying mice, family SARS-COVs, have been isolated, but it has been found that they are encoding different ORF8 proteins.
In strains isolated from the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide detonation was detected that is characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses.
The delegation divided ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and considered it an adaptive mutation, which accelerates the movement of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gammacroon viruses, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase.
Recombination locations have also been identified in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, the epidemic MERS-CoV has been shown to have been recombinant events between the various lines, which occurred in the one-bedded camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-COV and MERS-COV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCVs in which HCVs were recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that the artificial selection can contribute to accidental changes in virus genes, which is likely to result from the release of the virus from the selected pressure, for example by the immune system of the carrier.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-sized ORF4 in a prototype strain of HCV-229E due to a double-nucleotide decomposition.
While the intact open frame of ORF4 can be observed in mouse and camel viruses related to HCV-229E, alphaquinavirus alpaca demonstrates a single nucleotide inlet, resulting in a frame movement.
Finally, the evolution of new HCV is also due to pressure from their reservoirs.
In case of a virus-flighting virus infection, there were poorly reported symptoms or lack of them, which refers to the mutual adaptation between coronavirus and flying mice.
It turns out that flying mice are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, failure to activate a fire response in flying mice effectively reduces the pathology caused by coronary viruses.
In addition, the natural activity of cell killers in the flying mice is overpowered by the inhibitor receptor of the natural cell killer NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the major class I interoperability molecule.
Moreover, a high level of active oxygen, which is provided with high metabolic activity by flying mice, can suppress the replication of coronavirus, while affecting the count of exoribanuclease, thus creating the selection pressure for the generation of strains of the virus that are highly pathogenic when entering the new carrier.
More pathogenic strains of coronavirus can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the carrier.
Thus, it is no coincidence that in the last 20 years, three new human coronaviruses have appeared.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoirs, such as flying mice or camels.
They're definitely replicated without causing a strong immune response to the carrier.
This is a secret to why we see unsymptomatic carriers and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with hyperactivity of the immune response and cytokine fever, with the stronger immune response, the more severe the impact of the immune response.
On the contrary, unsymptomatic carriers do not have an immune response to coronavirus replication.
The same immune response strategy can have a beneficial effect on the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
In flying mice, there is a particularly strong interferonal response.
Thus, taking interferon I at least in the primary phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should have an beneficial effect.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3-inflammasoma has been violated in flying mice.
On this basis, inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasoma with MCC950 may be helpful in the treatment of COPID-19.
The development of SARS-COV-2 is based on a general scheme based on SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
While a betacronavirus was found with a fly mouse, with a 95%-coV-coV-nucleotide homology, there is also a coronavirus with a fly mouse, with a 96%-coV-nucleotide homology with a SARS-coV-2.
Although it has also been found that worms and other animals on the market carry viruses, identical SARS-COVs have not been identified directly by intermediate carriers for SARS-COV-2.
Pangoline beta-conaviruses have been detected, strikingly homologous SARS-CoV-2, which says that pangolines could be one of the intermediate carriers or that fragments of pangoline beta-conaconavirus genes could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by a person.
Coronaviruses have attracted general attention because of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in flying mice and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCOV animal reserves in human transmission.
Convictive evidence has shown that SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are derived from flying mice and have been transmitted to the person through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection occurs from contact between people and populations in the markets, the closure of the visa markets and the destruction of the population could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of the various lines of betaconaviruses of pangolines near the SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to remove pangolines in order to prevent zoonotic transmission of the infection from the food market.
However, whether SARS-COV-2 is transmitted to a person through pangoline and other dairy products and how this can be done remains the task of future studies.
On the other hand, the Mers-CoV virus has long existed in single-winged camels.
They serve as an important vehicle, as well as as the main source of meat, milk, leather and articles from the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and in Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in the Chinese wild animals markets to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
In order to stop the periodic outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-COV for camels in conjunction with other measures of infection control.
Since we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can occur causing outbreaks of the disease.
In the world, a variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating.
In particular, there are a wide variety of coronaviruses of flying mice with zoonotic potential.
There is a huge number of possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are easier to transmit and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
In order to reduce the number of extra contacts between humans and animals, the culture of wild animals in some areas of China should be abandoned.
After severe tests, which have become SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plan are required.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories are seized.
While many flying mice are beneficial for the spread of viruses, if they are taught to keep people away from them, the likelihood of human contact with flying mice and other wild animals can be minimized.
In order to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, permanent epidemiological surveillance is required for dairy animals, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of coronaviruses from animals and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep people away from the natural nests of zoonotic viruses.
Some fragments are still missing in the head of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, if flying mice transmitted a previous SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangoline, it is interesting to see under what circumstances the flying mice and pangoline share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if flying mice play a more direct role in human transfer, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with flying mice.
Thirdly, if a true intermediate carrier plays a third milking agent, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different types, including humans, flying mice and pangolins.
Finally, since many dairy animals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether the fly mouse, pangoline or another milking agent is expected to be identified in the future by SARS-CoV-2 or its precursor viruses.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Update of the diagnostic criteria required for “inspection of disease” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our group published a brief background guide on the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronary infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and reliable recommendations to combat this pandemic worldwide.
However, the coronal virus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for “disease suspicions” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the document “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19” (seventh version) issued by the National Committee on Health in the PRC.
In December 2019, a new coronary virus 2019 (2019-nCoV) was triggered, now officially called coronary infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus itself was called “a severe respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a short reference guide and published it on the Military Medical Research website on 6 February 2020.
This publication has brought great attention to itself.
Noting that COVID-19 is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven editions of the document “Diagnostic and Therapy Recommendations for COVID-19”, published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), have been substantially modified.
Recently, comments were made on our recommendations in the work of Zhou (Zhou), which contained simple diagnostic proposals based on already available clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as provided valuable background information on this pandemic that covers the whole world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest “Recommendations on Diagnostic and Therapy for COVID-19” (test seventh version) and the results of ongoing studies, their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (since 3 March 2020) for a comprehensive analysis to confirm the suspicion of disease, one element of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease must be combined:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of movements or locations in and around Uhan and its surroundings or other human sites where cases of COVID-19 disease have been recorded within 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) the history of contacts with patients who have been infected with SARS-COV-2 (with a positive test based on nuclear acid); (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Uhan and its surroundings or other human sites where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded during the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) the history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Uhan and its surroundings or from other human sites where cases of COVID-19 have been reported during the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) the history of contact with groups of confirmed diseases with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases with high temperatures or lys or lyses or lyses in such areas as lyseris and cis.
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of leukocytes is normal or decreased with a reduced number of lymphocytes at the early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for confirmed disease should be based on a suspicion of disease with one of the following pathogenetic or serological evidence: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-name sequence of the virus shows high homogeneity for new coronary viruses; (3) the positive results of serum tests for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies; or the change in the test result from positive for IgG-CoV-2 antibodies, or the increase of titres at least 4 times in the recovery phase for the respective fixed phase.
It can also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020) issue of the document, a real-time PCR test was added for nucleic acid in respiratory pathways or blood tests.
The pathogenetic diagnosis of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) issues, and then the seventh issue added the need for serological evidence.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers seeking the optimal set of nucleic acids for rapid diagnosis, as well as on the analysis of samples taken from respiratory pathways, including blood sample selection, which improves the availability of various samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive results for specific antibodies in the disease confirmation criteria.
However, there is increasing evidence of the need to be cautious in the treatment of patients with atypical symptoms and unexplained symptoms.
Thus, the road map presented in Zjou (Zhou) and others should be updated as non-clinical patients are classified as a low-risk group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practices and studies.
In conclusion, we hope to obtain more direct evidence and call on readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “supplications of disease” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to follow and follow closely the latest recommendations made in the countries in which they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in a timely manner to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID-19, the daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.
It's the greatest number of deaths from the virus per day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Disease Studies (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases were reported, as well as 33 hospitalized patients.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In the online briefing, director of IEDCR Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora explained that four men and one woman had become victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two have been over 60 years of age, two are between 51 and 60 years of age, and one is between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also reported that two people were dead from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
The clinic officer told the local news agency Annadolu that Jahal Saifur Rachman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, was one of the dead.
On Saturday, in an online video statement by the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Oaidul Quader said that public transport would be terminated for a longer time than originally planned before the next Saturday.
Public transport was stopped on 26 March and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of first-needed products — drugs, fuel and food — has still been authorised.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were registered in Bangladesh on 8 March for two persons who returned from Italy and for one of them.
As of 19 March, these three people have been cured.
SARS-COV-2 has exceeded the millions of cases of infection worldwide
According to John Hopkins University, the total number of cases of coronal infection SARS-CoV-2 worldwide has exceeded one million on Thursday.
At least 52,000 people have been killed by the COVID-19 coronavirus.
The virus occurred on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi and the first case of coronary disease was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries in which there were no cases of coronary infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 C.E. (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronary virus infection were recorded, of which at least 5,900 had a fatal outcome.
CBS News, referring to data from John Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths caused by coronary infection were recorded on Wednesday in the United States.
Countries around the world have announced that measures to prevent the spread of the disease have been intensified.
On Thursday, Mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobianin extended the regime of self-insulation of the city by 1 May.
Former President Vladimir Putin said that the Russians throughout the country, despite self-insulation, would receive a salary by 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of extending the emergency for 15 days; results of the vote: 215 votes “for”, 10 abstentions and one against”.
Saudi Arabia extended the ordering time in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while the previous ordering time lasted only 3 hours until 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to set up a ten o'clock in the evening by 4 o'clock in the morning.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike Dewein, announced that the regime of domestic self-insulation in the state was extended by order until 1 May.
Stores in Australia limit the number of packages of toilet paper to be purchased once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australia's Woolworths and Coles stores reduced the quantity of toilet paper packages, which could be purchased once in all country stores, up to two and one packages respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a restriction on one package.
These restrictions were reported in cash statements as well as on the Facebook website.
It is reported that citizens have begun to make emergency supplies because of the assurance that the COVID-19 system of general self-insulation may be in place.
On the Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the quantity of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, 4 and 5 March respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this number of 4 packages.
The Coles trading network, in its press release of 8 March, reported that with the introduction of restrictions on four packages “in many stores the toilet paper is still buying too fast, one supply over an hour,” and called such a request “unprecedented”, while the ALDI in Facebook post, published Tuesday, called such a trend “unawaited”.
According to the representative of Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the number of two packages last week.
In order to satisfy the deficit, Coles began to order larger parties from suppliers and increased supply frequency, Woolworths ordered additional parties, while ALDI made stocks for the special share of the early sale on the environment.
Russell Cimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Riddlers, reported that the Riddlers were trying to fill up the supplies, but this was difficult because local authorities had limited the timetable for freight cars.
It is expected to increase the cost of the product, as suppliers are trying to satisfy demand, but less and less favourable proposals are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, due to the decommissioning of stocks, some shops could not conduct environmental activities.
In News.com.au's report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert on retail trade at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill up stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper was a bulky item, so the quantity of stocks was small, and after the sale of the whole product, a long series of parcels remained empty, increasing the sense of lack of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the poles could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these poles in large quantities, buyers would probably not panic,” says Russell Cimmerman.
In the past, the manufacturer of who gave a Crap processed toilet paper reported the end of the stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sobent brands, reported that they are working around the clock to ensure a sufficient quantity of products.
Domain.com, a real estate sales site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne declined due to the absence of buyers on the Sunday of the Work Day, some real estate sellers began offering the first participants free toilet paper.
The fourth daily issue of NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab for cutting and use as a toilet paper.
According to the ABC Australia report of 3 March, the stores were reluctant to impose restrictions on the quantity of goods acquired, claiming that they were not planning to do so.
Russell Cimmerman added that other products also benefit from increased demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, gallantry, handwashing and torture.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, on Sunday evening, it was noted that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres's toilet paper with two packs of 12 reels.
The World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On the Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the pandemic of COVID-19 infection caused by coronvirus SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the fact that the term “pandemic” only describes the extent of the disease, rather than the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that Governments must take measures:
“All countries are still in a position to influence the development of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, treat, isolate the sick, monitor the occurrence of the disease and mobilize their citizens,” explained WHO Director-General, Mr. Tedros Adana Gebreísus.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inactivity.”
According to Dr. Tom Friden, former director of the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented”.
In his interview with CNN in February, he said that “no respiratory virus other than influenza had yet to be traced from its onset to continuous global distribution”.
Mr. Gebreisos expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen pandemics caused by coronary viruses.
We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.”
First, in January, WHO announced the outbreak of this emergency in the field of public health, which is of international importance and then granted it a new pandemic status.
The Director of the National Institute of Allergics and Infections of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauchi, responded by saying, “This is only the beginning, it will be worse”.
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were registered on Thursday, with more than 4,600 deaths.
Pandemia of the coronary virus 2019-2020 is currently in place of the pandemic of the coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a severe severe respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Uhana, China, in December 2019 and the emergency situation of 30 January 2020 was declared international public health significance, which was subsequently recognized as pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were registered in 210 countries and regions, resulting in the deaths of some 97,000 people.
About 364,000 people recovered.
China's mortality rate is 4 per cent, while worldwide it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include nausea, cough and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and severe respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also range from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive; the recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the lips with cough, observing the distance between people, identifying and securing self-insulating people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world have responded to the situation by imposing restrictions on travel, quarantine, command clock, workplace risk control and closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, transfer or abolition of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as a widespread lack of goods exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4% of the world ' s students.
The Internet began to spread information about the virus, there were cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people who recalled them externally, as well as other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of virus proliferation were noted.
As a result of a reduction in the number of travel and closures of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of Uhanh (the capital of the province of Hubey) reported that pneumonia had occurred for an unknown reason and an investigation of the situation had been initiated in early January 2020.
Infectious cases were mainly related to the general market for Juanan marine products, so the virus is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus caused by the outbreak of the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a recently-opened virus that has a great deal to do with mouse coronaviruses, pangoline coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease occurred on 1 December 2019 and that the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the infections registered in December 2019 were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, the publication of the Southern Chinese newspaper Morning Post, whose information was not verified, suggested that the first case of infection had occurred with the 55-year-old resident of Hubey Province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases of infection in China had decreased but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases of infection outside China for the first time exceeded the number of new cases of infection in China itself.
The number of cases of the disease can be significantly reduced, in particular due to the number of cases with poorly-expressed symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases of juvenile infection were registered, with patients under 19 years of age and younger, accounting for less than 2.4% of cases worldwide.
Statistics include cases of infection of persons who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, an official policy was adopted that did not require testing with only minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March showed that by 23 January China had not detected 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections and that such unregistered diseases had become a source of infection for 79 per cent of registered cases.
The statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy was significantly higher than the number of cases recorded.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention provides that this figure may be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are well managed.
In other more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the time of death was 6 to 41 days, the most frequent period of 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths occurred in persons over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of those who died from concomitant diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official data on mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include information on the deaths of patients with positive outcome of the COVID test carried out under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take into account dead people who have not been tested, for example, in the case of death at home, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
The incomplete data on Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID indicators 4-5 times.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Press Secretary recognizes: “We know that [the reported number of deaths] is below actual.” His words are confirmed by reports of some single cases in the U.S.. Such data are often found in pandemics such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic 2009. The first confirmed death was registered in Uhana on 9 January 2020.
The first death was registered on 1 February in the Philippines and on 14 February in the border of Asia.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths were recorded outside China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions in all continents, except Antarctica, reported deaths; several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary according to the region and the time of the spread of the disease; they also affect the levels of testing, the quality of health systems used in treatment schemes, the time from the onset of outbreaks of the disease and the population parameters, such as age, sex and overall health status.
According to statistics from the University of Jones Hopkins, as of 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality rate for the disease was reduced from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms since 1 February 2020). Other methods include the definition of the percentage of mortality caused by the disease (CFR), the percentage of diagnosed patients dying from the disease and the percentage of death from the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients dying from the disease.
These statistics do not relate to a specific time period and reflect the indicators of certain population groups from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators by specific groups of people.
According to the Oxford University Medical Evidence Centre, the mortality rate from this pandemic is generally 0.1 to 0.39 per cent.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first random test on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analysing the impact of the test on the CFR assessment.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact length of the blast shall not be determined and may vary depending on the location.
Macie Bonnie, a member of the University of Pennsylvania State, claims that “uncontrolled outbreaks usually occur on the plate, and then when the number of available carriers is over, they begin to disappear.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable predictions as to when this will happen.”
The Senior Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, Jun Nanishan, claims that “all can end by June”, if all countries are able to mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will be circulating perhaps within a year or two”.
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the guidance of Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine is established (possible, 18 months or more)”, it will be necessary to comply with physical distance and other measures.
William Schaffner, a member of the University of Vanderbilt, believes: “I don’t think that this coronavirus will ever disappear at all, because it is so easily transmitted,” and that it “can become a seasonal disease every year.”
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may carry a disease without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88 per cent) and dry cough (68 per cent).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory wet formation (slip), redness, swelling, muscle pain, throat pain, headache, dizziness, redness, bleeding, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO claims to be seriously ill with the development of respiratory problems for about six persons.
The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list urgent symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or feeling numbness, sudden feeling of consciousness, difficulty in awakening and sweating of the person or loss. These symptoms should be addressed immediately for medical attention. Further development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected people may experience disease without any clinical signs, but the results of the analysis confirm the infection, and therefore physicians recommend that patients in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed be placed under strict control and examined for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of unsymptomatic flow of the disease varies from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The usual incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; usually it is five days; there is no complete clarity due to the sudden loss of redness; initially, the percentage of patients with COPID-19 who developed the symptom was 30 per cent and then decreased to 15 per cent.
Some details on the methods of spreading the disease are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is transmitted mainly during close contact, as well as through small air droplets with cough, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, the caps can range from 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small air droplets that can remain in the air for a longer time. Respiratory droplets can also be formed when out, including during the conversation, although the virus is not normally transported by air.
The chapels can fall into the mouth or nose of a number of people, as well as into the light.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (SDRs), may lead to the spread of respiratory products and, therefore, to the spread of the virus in the air.
It may also penetrate into the body if the person is concerned with the contaminated surface, including the skin, with a subsequent touch to his eyes, nose or lips.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through faecals, but the risk of such transmission is considered low.
The Chinese Government denied the possibility of a fecal or oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus was most infected within the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although its spread may occur both before the onset of symptoms and at later stages of the disease.
There have been cases of positive tests during the three days prior to onset of symptoms, and this refers to the possibility of transmission of the virus until the onset of symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratoryly confirmed cases of unsymptomatic flow of the disease, but in some countries, reports of transmission of the disease from unsymptomatic carriers have also been reported.
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) officials claim that the extent to which the virus is easily spread is not clear, however, it is known that one patient is usually infected with 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on the surface from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on a stainless steel (304) virus can live up to three days, on a cardboard surface — for one day and on a slow surface — up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary depending on the humidity and temperature. Households and other animals received a positive result for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit a virus to humans, although the British authorities advise that they wash their hands after contact with animals, just as, for example, after contact with other surfaces that could be attached to infected humans.
The severe severe respiratory virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first discovered in three persons with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhana.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the natural coronaviruses. Outside of the human body, the virus can be destroyed by means of a home mill that dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is supposed to be of zoonotic origin.
The genetic analysis of coronavirus showed that it is genetically classified with the genus Betacoronavirus, the genus Sarbecovirus (cell line B) together with two other strains of flying mice.
It is 96% identical to other models of mouse coronavirus (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, the Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the sequences of pangoline and human viruses.
The whole-art comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage (92 per cent) is between the pangoline coronary virus and the SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that the pangolins are intermediate masters of the virus.
The virus infection may be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although ultimately it should be confirmed by an analysis of a polymeric chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of the infected secret or computer tomography.
The results of the study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Uhana showed that CT was much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease-related processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation “Do not use CT for boxing or as a method for testing the first line in the COVID-19 diagnosis”.
WHO published several RNA test protocols at SARS-CoV-2, and the first was published on 17 January.
A real-time polymeric chain reaction test (RT-PCR) is conducted.
It can be carried out on breath samples and blood samples.
The results are usually prepared for a period of several hours to a few days.
A number of laboratories and companies develop serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them proved accurate enough to obtain universal approval.
In the United States, the serological test developed by Cellex was approved for use in emergency cases only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of visualization of X-rays and computer tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral contamination of the type of mammary glass and lack of pleural discharges.
The Italian Radiological Society is involved in the international base of photos of confirmed cases of infection.
Because of other infections, such as adenvirus, with the identification of COPID-19 images not confirmed by PCR tests, have a limited clinical specification.
A large study was conducted in China comparing the results of the CTC of the breast cell and the PCR testing, and it was found that, although the photos are less specific in the case of infection, they could be decrypted faster; they were also more sensitive and therefore the diagnostic method could be considered as a boxing tool in infected areas.
In order to diagnose the virus using X-rays and computer tomography, the artificial intelligence-based nerve networks have been developed.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include the maintenance of general personal hygiene, washing of hands, avoiding eye, nose or mouth contact with dirty hands, use in coughing or brushing of socks, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already have been infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that people be physically separated; many Governments recommend refraining from any untimely journey to countries and areas affected by outbreaks and restricting the movement of citizens.
However, the virus has been able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is distributed to the population, some of which do not know where and how they were infected. Medical workers who are caring for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions when contacting other people and the means to protect their eyes.
The use by Governments of data on the location of citizens with their mobile phones has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), as well as over 100 other organizations, have made statements requiring that this type of monitoring be restricted.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as of 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups have worked on the development of personal data-confidential solutions, such as the registration of the user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user is in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test has been positive, he receives the notification. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection, such as nose and mouth swelling, which is actually ineffective.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working on it.
To prevent the spread of the disease, hand washing is recommended.
CDC (the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the visit of the toilet or when the hands are severely contaminated, as well as before the meal, after swallowing, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because, while outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic mouse that conceals its protective cover.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends that disinfectants be used to treat alcohol-based hands at least 60 per cent.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, noses or lips with dirty hands.
Surfaces may be disinfected by a number of solutions (on the surface of the stainless steel disinfectant begins to operate a minute after administration) containing 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% pervidone iodine.
Other components, such as benzoyl chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that in the event of suspicion of COPID or its confirmation in the establishment, such as an office or a daily station, all spaces of such premises, including cabinets, toilets, general facilities, electronic equipment, such as panels, sensor screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose of the back of the rag or of the walnut and immediately removing used items of hygiene.
Those who may have been infected are recommended to use medical masks, since the use of masks may limit the volume and extent of the spread of the extracts that are scattered in the air when talking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virusologist at the University of Lids, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, and the touch of the face with dirty hands is a major way of infection”. Masks are also recommended for the use of those who protect against people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, for example, for persons who are wearing a man with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of masks actually reduces the number of injuries to the person.
Several countries began calling for the use of medical masks in public places.
The CDC centres, in the United States, recommend wearing non-medical facial masks. China has emphasized separately the importance of using one-time medical masks for healthy people, especially if they are in close contact with other people (1 m (3 ft) or less).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or in public places.
Health officials in Thailand call on people to prepare and remove facial tissue masks in their home environments.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from entering the street without masks closing their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has committed all visitors to food stores to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks are made in mid-March, it was prescribed to use medical masks for all passengers on trains and interurban buses.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask on their way out; it is recommended that those who cannot afford masks should be carried in their own home environments.
Medical masks are also widely used by the inhabitants of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is an anti-infection measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and malls.
People can use social distance measures, staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding people ' s places, using uninvited greeting and physical distance from others.
Many Governments of the regions, particularly those affected by the outbreak, are currently prescribing or recommending social distance.
The maximum number of people who could be gathered in one place, as recommended by the United States Government and health organizations, was rapidly reduced from 250 (in regions where no data on the prevalence of COVID-19) to 50 and later to 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the gathering in groups of more than two people. Older people and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious virus disease. The CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if there is a outbreak of disease in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began replacing the term “social distance” with “physical distance” and thus clarifying the objective of this measure – to reduce physical contact in social relations, whether by virtual or physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood to mean that people should be subjected to full social isolation rather than to remain in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some authorities published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it has been recommended to engage in sexual intercourse only with your permanent partners with whom you live, and in whom you are sure that there is no virus and its symptoms.
Persons diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected are recommended for self-insulation in domestic conditions.
Health institutions have published detailed instructions on proper self-insulation, and many Governments have also made mandatory or recommended that the entire population of affected areas be placed in quarantine on their own.
The strictest quarantine was prescribed for people in high-risk groups.
Persons who may have contacted infected COVID-19 or recently visited a country or region, to a significant extent affected by the epidemic, have been recommended to find quarantine for 14 days since the last possible contact.
The strategies for combating outbreaks include curbing the spread of the disease, suppression or mitigation.
The prevention of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and is aimed at tracking and insulating the infected, as well as other measures of infection control and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a stage where the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to mitigate the impact: measures are being taken to reduce the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to curb and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease may be taken at the same time.
The suppression of the infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections below 1. Part of the infection outbreak management effort is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the equation of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading of health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to cope with outbreaks include measures of personal prevention, such as hand hygiene, use of medical masks and self-insulation; public measures aimed at physical distance, such as the closure of schools and the abolition of mass activities; community involvement in and participation in such measures; and measures to protect the environment, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantine have been introduced, as well as an alert system for the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, they provided financial support to those infected with self-insulation and imposed large fines on those who did not.
In Taiwan, production of medical masks and drug surpluses has increased, and the United Kingdom and the United States modeling has shown that there are serious problems in reducing (slow but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and in stopping the epidemic.
The optimal policy to mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3 and mortality is twice, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapse of health systems.
The pressure may be a preferred method, but it must be used until the virus circulates among the population (or until the vaccine is developed if it occurs earlier), because otherwise the spread of the disease will be restored rapidly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term interference to suppress the pandemic results in social and economic costs.
There are currently no antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking non-receptive medicines from the cold, drinking sufficient fluids and rest can help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the patient's disease, oxygen therapy, internal fluidization and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids can only be harmful.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also considered for the treatment of COPID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and household funds” could facilitate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity-building and adaptation of health to the needs of patients with COPID-19 as a major response to the outbreak of the disease.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office have issued guidelines for primary health care clinics and services to assist in the redeployment of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, the abolition of non-term procedures, where possible, the detection of the virus and isolation of patients with confirmed diagnosis COVID-19, and the enhancement of the capacity of intensive therapy through staff training and the increase in the number of available devices of IHFs and cats.
There are different theories about where the first case of infection could occur — the so-called “zero patient”.
The first known case of a new coronary infection was probably in the city of Uhan Province of Hubey, China, on 1 December 2019.
During the month, the number of cases of coronary virus infection in the province of Hubei increased gradually.
They were mainly related to the general market of the Juanan marine products in which live animals were also sold, and one theory was that the virus penetrated into the human organism from one of those animals; in other words, the virus had a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a case of mass pneumonia of unknown origin was registered at Hubey Province Hospital, where Dr. Zjan Tianzinin was working at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the City of Uhanan.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at the Uhanan Central Clinic warned their colleagues about “coronavirus similar to SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenjan, had been warned by the police about the responsibility for spreading false rumors, and a doctor, Ih Fen, had received an excuse from his superiors for panicked.
Later, on 31 December, the Uhanya Municipal Health Commission published a public notice and informed WHO about the situation.
The Ugandan health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which was large enough to initiate an investigation in early January. At the early stages, the number of cases was doubled by about seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was also spread in other Chinese provinces, which was promoted by Chinese New Year's holidays and the fact that Uhan was a transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases of infection in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Schengen.
As of 26 March, the United States seized China and Italy on the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases of infection were registered worldwide, more than 97,000 people were killed, and more 364,000 people were killed.
Some 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one recorded infection.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area have restricted their free movement and imposed border controls.
National response measures included measures to curb the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory home stay, mandatory shelter or isolation), as well as the time of command. As of 2 April, some 300 million people, or some 90 per cent of the population of the United States, were in some form quarantine, more than 50 million people were in the Philippines, some 59 million people were in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion people were in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in a form of isolation, and in two days the figure increased to 2.6 billion — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Uhana on 1 December 2019; according to the second report, the validity of which was not verified, that date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhaan Zisan worked with the case of a massive pneumonia disease of an unknown type, as reported by the Center for Monitoring and Prevention of Chiangan Disease in the City of Uhan on 27 December.
The initial genetic testing of patients on 27 December 2019 showed the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Uhanya issued a relevant public notice.
WHO was notified that same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned a doctor in Uhana about the responsibility for the “dissemination of rumors” of the outbreak.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of the re-detected virus ' s ability to be transmitted from human to human.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, which was later called the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Si Xinpin, “the national war”.
The events of “the largest quarantine in the history of humanity” began on 23 January, the Sanitary Border was declared and the ban on entry into and return to Uganda, later spread to a total of 15 cities in the province of Hubei and reached a total of about 57 million people.
There was a ban on the use of personal transport in the city.
Celebrations for China's New Year (January 25) have been cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Hoosinšan, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Laishenšan, was built, which was taken by other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built Chinese hospitals, 14 other institutions in Uhana, such as conference centres and stadiums, have also been redesigned in temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government has taken additional measures to curb the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health reports for travellers and the extension of the Chinese New Year ' s celebration.
Universities and schools were closed all over the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions, the Chinese authorities have introduced a remote working regime.
Travel restrictions were imposed in the province of Hubei and beyond.
The schedule for public transport was changed and the museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
In many cities, a system of monitoring of the movement of citizens was introduced, and it was estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of restrictions on the movement in open air. Following the outbreak in the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the import of the virus from other countries.
For example, there was a 14-day mandatory quarantine in Beijing for all international travellers entering the city. As at 23 March in mainland China, only one case of the transmission of infection within the country, which occurred five days before, was registered in this case by a man who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, China's Prime Minister, Li Catehn, reported that the spread of internally transmitted diseases had been largely halted and the outbreak in China had been monitored.
On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubey were lifted, except for Uhanya, two months after the quarantine closure. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that the entry of visas or residence permits would be suspended from 28 March, and that the deadlines for the cancellation of the order were not called.
Those wishing to come to China would have to make applications for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on businesses and factories to resume their work and to provide companies with a package of money-stimulation measures. On 4 April, at 10:00 a national “minute of silence” was held, which was the day of mourning over the victims of the coronary virus, announced by the State Council of the country and coincided with Quinminh, but the central government asked citizens to pay tribute to the deceased online while respecting physical distance in order to avoid the recurrence of the COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread from China to South Korea on 20 January 2020.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of disease, which occurred in many instances because of the high number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus of Shinchhonji.
The followers of Shinchhonji came to Tegu from Uhanya, which is probably the source of the blast.
As of 22 February, of the 9,336 church followers 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported symptoms of disease. On 23 February 2020, the highest level of anxiety was announced in South Korea.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were registered in Korea on 28 February and the rate increased to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after the three soldiers had confirmed the presence of the virus, according to the analysis.
The explosion affected the number of flights, therefore, the schedule of flights has been changed; South Korea has launched a programme on the protection of the population against the presence of a virus, the tracking of contacts and the provision of quarantine measures for contact persons; the programme is considered to be the largest and the best in terms of its organization worldwide.
The boxing methods included mandatory information on their symptoms through a mobile application to all who came from abroad, primary virus testing, the results of which have been prepared for the next day, as well as increased testing capabilities that allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's programme is considered successful in combating the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that the whole city has not been isolated there.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called on Mr. Moon to give the impression that the Government ' s response to the outbreak of the disease was inadequate.
On 23 March, it was reported that in South Korea the lowest total number of infections per day was recorded within four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April, all newly arrived from the border would be placed on a two-week quarantine.

On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kuma, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people ended later that day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural and sporting activities, Friday's prayer, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has awarded five trillion reilions to combat the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not intend to quarantine all areas affected by the blast, but only individuals would be placed on the quarantine.
In March, plans to limit inter-urban travel were announced, but the intensive movement between cities prior to the New Year continued.
Shiite festivals in Kuma remained open for firefighters until 16 March 2020. Iran became the centre for the spread of the virus after China in February.
In the light of the statements on the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries linked the occurrence of the outbreak with Iran by 28 February, indicating that the outbreaks there may be more serious than 388 cases registered by the Iranian Government by that date.
Iran's parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members reported on 3 March were positive.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison management to release human rights defenders detained for peace-keeping reasons and to release all prisoners belonging to this category temporarily.
The organization claims that there is an increased risk of virus proliferation in closed institutions, such as prisons where adequate medical care is lacking.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths during one day — the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died.
By March 23, Iran had registered 50 new cases of coronary disease every hour and every ten minutes — one new death from the coronary virus.
According to a WHO representative, the level of disease in Iran may be five times higher than the official data reported.
The United States sanctions against Iran are also expected to affect the country ' s financial capabilities in terms of protection against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for economic sanctions to be mitigated against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease had taken place in the territory of Italy when two Chinese tourists tested SARS-CoV-2 in Rome had a positive result.
The number of cases of infection has grown rapidly, which has prompted the Italian Government to suspend all flights to China and China and to declare an emergency.
Later, an unassociated COVID-19 infection cluster was found and 16 confirmed cases were registered in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree on banning outbreaks, whereby more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed in quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “Enter the area of the outbreak of the disease and exit from it will be closed.

As of 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of recovery, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One of the reports by CNN noted that such a high level of mortality in Italy could contribute to the combination of two factors: a large number of elderly citizens in that country and the lack of access to all those who are now more coronalized.
The United Kingdom responded to the virus most peacefully from all affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British Government did not oblige citizens to comply with any form of social distance or quarantine.
On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending refraining from all visits and social contacts that were not of primary importance, offering people the opportunity to work from home and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should be closed as soon as possible and promised to pay up to 80 per cent of the salary, but not more than 2,500 pounds per month as a means of supporting the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent measures on social distance, prohibiting the gathering of more than two people and limiting the travel and active rest of the air to extreme needs.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed through police involvement, the introduction of fines and the disappearance of human graves.
Most of the companies were ordered to close, except for those that provide “life-saving” services, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, business stores, auto repair stations and garages.

Nevertheless, population testing in the United States was not started immediately, and the true outbreaks of the disease during that period were hidden.
The test was difficult because of the marriage of tests issued by the Federal Government in February, the lack of a federal government authorization to use non-State tests developed by scientific organizations, companies and clinics, as well as the limiting criteria prior to the beginning of March that would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done by appointment of a medical doctor).
The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States by 27 February.
The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests were conducted by 13 March.

WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and prevent the spread of infection.
WHO noted the clear differences between the situation with the outbreak of atypical pneumonia in 2002-2004, in which the Chinese authorities were accused of insinuating information that it was alleged to have prevented the prevention and deterrence of the disease, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central government “supplyed regularly to avoid panic before the Chinese New Year”.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to ban the movement of transport in Uhana, WHO representative of the Year of Galea noted that although “this measure was definitely not recommended by WHO”, it was also “an important confirmation of the implementation of the obligation to stop the epidemic in the most widespread place” and called it “unprecedented in public health history”. On 30 January, after confirming the ability to transmit the infection from a person outside China and the increase in the number of infected countries, WHO announced an emergency situation in the public health system of international importance (PHEIC); this situation became the sixth since 2009, when this measure was first applied during the swine flu pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adana, stated that the announcement of PHEIC was due to “the risk of global proliferation, especially in low- and middle-income countries that did not have reliable health systems.
Commenting on the restrictions on travel, Mr. Tedros said that “there are no reasons for measures that unduly impede international movements and trade”, and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to allocate US$ 675 million to provide strategic preparedness for the low-income epidemic, reporting the need for urgent assistance to those countries that “do not have systems to identify people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the measure of our readiness is the degree of readiness for the epidemic of our weakest calling”, and urged the international community to “make a choice: invest today or pay in the future”. At a press conference on 11 February, WHO established an official name of the disease — COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrish agreed to provide “the full potential of the UN system in response to the problem”.
As a result, the United Nations Crisis Management Unit was set up to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, according to WHO, will “focus on health responses, while other agencies can use their experience to combat the outbreak of disease in a broader social and economic context”.
On 14 February, WHO and China launched a joint special group to provide the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to help resolve the situation within the country and assess “seriousness of disease and its infection”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of response measures at the level of the provinces and districts, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for the possible pandemic of the coronary virus, noting that “it is too early to call this pandemic, but countries must be ready for it”.
When the outbreak struck Iran, WHO sent a joint group to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the likelihood of global coronary disease spread would be increased by “high” to “high” high levels of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, the Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in his statement: “This is a review of each government on the planet to be ready for the real situation: time to work.
This virus may already be on its way to your country, and you need to be ready," and stressed that the right response can help the world avoid “the worst scenario of development”.
Ryan also stated that the current data did not serve as a basis for the proclamation of the global pandemic by official public health representatives, and added that the proclamation of the pandemic would mean that “we in fact recognize the fact that everyone on the planet will be at risk of being infected with the virus”.
On 11 March, the WHO announced the outbreak of a pandemic coronary virus.
The Director-General of WHO said that WHO was “deeply concerned about both the alarming high levels of spread and severity of the disease and at least the alarming levels of inaction in this regard”. WHO was severely criticized for a considered inadequate approach to the concept of the pandemic, including the subsequent announcement of an emergency in public health and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a response to the current situation with regard to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanyam, a petition was made with a proposal to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN experts on human rights stressed the importance of respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Expert Group stated that everyone had the right to apply to him a life-saving measure and that the Government was responsible for the organization of such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should not at all justify discrimination against a particular group of people.
The experts emphasized that everyone has the right to health, including those with limited opportunities, minority groups, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, people living in extreme poor conditions, prisoners, refugees and other disadvantaged groups in need of State support.
International government organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has set up a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to familiarize with views and recommendations.
The country Policy Tracker contains information on policy measures to strengthen health systems and the world economy, address the impact of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote coordinated global responses to the fight against coronvirus.
The Government of China has been criticised by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gowa and Eduardo Bolsonar, son of President Jaira Bolsonar of Brazil, for actions to combat the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubey.
A number of leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) level of provinces were fired for the quarantine measures they had taken in the central part of China, and these discharges showed a dissatisfaction with the political response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party from the public's rage over the outbreak of the coronary virus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lizzyan, disagreed with the earlier statement that the outbreak of the coronary virus began in Uhana, but took the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. Presidential Administration Donald Trampa called the “Chinese virus” or “Uhana virus”, stating that “Censorship in China only exacerbates the situation with the virus that has now become a global pandemic”, which in turn has been criticized by some commentators who claim that such an approach is racist and “deprives the U.S. President’s administration’s ability to prevent the spread of disease”.
The Daily Beast has access to the U.S. Government telegram, which contains communication strategic skills, apparently invented by the National Security Council, with the following references to the strategy: “Everything in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television presentations." Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg stated that China's efforts to assist countries affected by the virus are part of the propaganda effort to achieve global impact.
The head of the EU foreign policy department, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a “geopolitical component that includes the fight against the influence of the pirate and so-called generosity policy”.
Borrell also stated that “China is actively promoting the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States”.
China has also called on the United States to abolish sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while some information has been provided to assist in the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 Cuban medical masks was banned in connection with US sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The United States authorities are also accused of transferring assistance to their own country.
There have also been disputes about medical masks among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has allocated hundreds of IVLs to Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticised the lack of support by the European Union for the coronavirus in Italy.
Mauricio Massari, the EU's ambassador to Italy, said that "China only reacted bilaterally.
This clearly does not show European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, organized a shipment to Italy of Russian military sanitaries, specialized disinfection and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cites an anonymous “high-level political source”, claiming that 80 per cent of Russian assistance was “useless or of little use for Italy”.
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favourable impression on the world public at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
The President of Lombardy Attilio Fontana and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Mayo, rejected media attacks and thanked them for their assistance.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
The Press Secretary, Kremlin Dmitri Peskov, stated that “by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when American medical equipment and materials grow, they will also be able to provide response if necessary”.
NATO's Defence 2020 military training, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, the largest NATO military training after the end of the Cold War, will be conducted in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticised the Defence 2020 (Protector 2020): “In the crisis that has been in the field of public health today, these studies pose a threat not only to the lives of the US military and many European participating countries, but also to the people of countries where such activities are to be carried out”. The Government of Iran has suffered a severe virus.
On 14 March 2020, President Hasan Ruhani, in an open letter, addressed world leaders with a request for assistance, saying that his country had difficulty in combating the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets in connection with sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic called on the United States to adopt social policies common to other countries, including the introduction of a single health and care system for children paid for family leave and the increase in public health funding.
Politologists expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Tramp's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential elections, resulting in a deterioration in diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan ' s “unique and passive quarantine measures” after Japan announced that any citizen who arrived from South Korea would be placed on a two-week quarantine site specifically designated by the Government.
South Korean society was originally divided by the reaction of President Mue-Je-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called on Mr. Moon to give the impression that the response of the Government to the outbreak of the disease was inadequate.
Some commentators expressed concern that this step would enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Viktor Orbán the unlimited right to administer by decree, to suspend Parliament's work, and to hold elections and to punish those who would be accused of spreading faecal information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The outbreak of coronavirus was described as the cause of several cases of supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment for the control of the epidemic, the accumulation of goods in panic and the collapse of production and logistics operations.
The Office of the U.S. Food and Drug Quality Management has issued warnings about the lack of medicines and medical equipment, resulting in increased consumer demand and reductions in vendors.
There were also panic buyings in several human settlements; this led to a situation where first-needed items such as food, toilet paper and bottled water disappeared from the stock market, which, in turn, led to a shortage of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director General, Mr. Tedros Adanyam, the demand for individual protection increased 100 times.
This leap led to a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the usual price, as well as delays in delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
He also called for the lack of individual protection throughout the world, and WHO warned that for this reason, health workers would be under attack.
In Australia, buyers in the Daigou system were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods in China.
This activity led to a lack of child food in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Government of Australia. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Uhan region, as well as the high demand for food, both areas had managed to avoid severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and illegal trade in products that have proved to be successful have prevented the acute food shortages that were expected in Europe and in North America.
Northern Italy, with small-scale agricultural production, did not experience significant falls, but, in the view of industry, agricultural prices could increase.
The food stores remained vacant only temporarily, even in the city of Uhan, while China's government officials provided access to pig stocks in order to provide adequate food for the population.
Similar laws, which require food producers to preserve food stocks in the event of emergencies, also exist in Italy.
The impact of the global economy on China was that, according to the media of 16 March, China's economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 because of measures to combat the spread of the virus adopted by the Government, resulting in a decrease of 20.5 per cent.
Maternal China is a major economic and productive centre; therefore, a virus outbreak is considered to be a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to Agate Demarai, Economist Intelligence Unit staff, market volatility will remain in place until a more clear picture of potential results is available.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current global growth epidemic could be greater than that of the atypical pneumonia epidemic 2002-2004.
According to one estimate made by an expert at the University of Washington, St. Louis, damage to the world supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could be up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) has begun to take “fast measures” following a sharp decrease in oil prices due to China's demand for oil.
On 24 February, world stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside of mainland China.
On 27 February, due to the growing fear of the outbreak of coronary virus, various United States fund indices, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Doo-Johns index for industrial companies, showed the most dramatic decline since 2008, with the Doo index falling by 1191, the largest one-day drop since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10-percent drop.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
The actions again fell due to the fear of the spread of the coronary virus, and the biggest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a likelihood of economic recession.
The economist, Mohammed El-Erian, praised the timely emergency measures taken by the central banks and States.
Central banks respond faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in terms of bans on movement, closing public places, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of Governments not to travel.
As a result of all of these measures, many airlines cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in flight demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional Flybe aircraft ceased its existence.
The impact on the cruise line industry has been as strong as ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chung-jun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year's celebrations.
National and regional Governments have abolished a number of activities involving a large number of people, including annual new festivals; private companies have also shut down their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many new-year activities have been cancelled and tourist attractions have been closed in order to prevent mass graves; for example, the prohibited city has been closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs have been removed.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and areas of China, the authorities extended the new year ' s canials until 10 February, indicating that the majority of enterprises were not open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and announced an emergency, closing schools by March and canceling the New Year's celebration. The retail sector has been affected in a global manner: the working hours of shops have been reduced, and some shops have been temporarily closed.
A 40 per cent drop in the number of retail outlets in Europe and Latin America.
Diversification companies in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by between 50 and 60 per cent.
As a result, the attendance of trade centres fell by 33 to 43 per cent in March compared to February.
Operators of trade centres around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, equipment to check the temperature of visitors and cancel activities. According to the estimates of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic may leave 14-22 million more people behind poverty than it would have been in a similar situation but without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China in the outbreak of the Uganda epidemic.
Many of the 300 million Chinese migrant rural workers were housed in their country's provinces or closed in the province of Hubey. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the Government for assistance.
According to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the outbreak of coronary disease in the United States may have left 47 million people at work, and the unemployment rate may be 32 per cent. Self-insulation measures introduced in India have left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers unemployed on a daily basis. A study conducted by the Institute of Angus Reida showed that 44 per cent of Canadian households have faced unemployment in some way, and almost 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a single social payment. Almost half a million companies in Germany transferred their staff to a government-subsidized reduced working day.
The German unemployment pay scheme was also introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, worldwide.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (very funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their staff and the public, as well as, if possible, supporting the people of art.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed for an indefinite period, or had access to them to a different extent, and exhibitions, events and presentations were cancelled or transferred to other dates.
Efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and yet another recent and growing follow-up to the spread of the virus is the abolition of religious services, major sports activities and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the abolition of the Easter Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Christian Repentant period, the Great Post.
Many eparchys recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend Sunday services; in some churches, church services begin to broadcast on radio, live air, or television, while some church leaders offer public service.
The Roman Catholic Church of Rome closed to visit its churches, the clocks and the St. Peter's Square, where Christian palaces no longer appear, and later other religious organizations also canceled the services and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and temples.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the abolition of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of the coronary virus, and the sanctuaries were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned the access of foreign settlers and their own residents to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
Pandemia has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or transferred, including the UEFA 2019-20 Championships League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the Euro 2020 UEFA, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak of the Coronavirus also destroyed plans for the Summer Olympics of 2020, which were due to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “transferred after 2020 but not later than the summer of 2021”. Casinos and other mountain establishments around the world were closed and poker tournaments normally broadcast in direct air were either transferred or cancelled.
This has resulted in many players going online, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, and the entertainment industry has also suffered because different music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as shipyards, also canceled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional off-line events, some artists and musicians began to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results online, organizing direct online concerts or web festivals; this helps people to continue to perform, publish or publish their productions.
There have been numerous online mems on the topic of coronavirus, many of which are humorous, and are alleging alarming attitudes that are typical of uncertainty periods.
Since the occurrence of COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia and racism with regard to Chinese citizens and people of East Asian origin, as well as representatives of the hot spots of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have been reported in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
In the February briefings (when most of the infection was still restricted by China), racist attitudes were recorded in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens, who allegedly deserved the virus or received a fair reward for something.
In some African countries, anti-Chinese attitudes have also increased.
Many of the inhabitants of Uhanya and Hubeya reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
China's citizens, as well as its residents living in areas affected by the virus, have been supported both online and online.
The epidemic began to spread in new countries, in particular in Italy, the first in Europe to face the severe outbreak of COVID-19; hence, citizens of such regions may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed a petition early in order to prevent Chinese citizens from entering their countries in order to curb the epidemic.
In Japan, Haitteg #ChineseDontComeToJapan (Chinese) took a leading position on Twitter.
China ' s citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report on the growing level of racist attitudes and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticised for calling the crown virus “Chinese virus”; critics consider it racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign nationals from the Uhanya to New Sanjara.
Students arriving from the border with China north-east India and learning in large cities in India reported cases of outbreaks of coronary virus.
Dilip Ghosh, president of Bharatia Janata State Department, West Bengalia, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and therefore “God has avenged them”.
Later, these statements were condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, which called them “demonstration”, and in China, because of the pandemic, xenophobia and racism again erupted in relation to Chinese non-citizens: foreigners were called “foreign garbage” and objects to be “utilized”.
Many newspapers with free access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the coronary virus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles about the outbreak of coronavirus available to the public.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their studies on print publishing servers, such as bioRxiv.
Dissemination of infection — Infection from returning pathogen, distribution range or method of transmission are often unknown
Globalization and Disease — Overview of Globalization and Dissemination of Diseases
List of epidemics and pandemics — List of fatalities
Trafficking in wild animals and diseases transmitted from animal to animal is a health risk associated with trafficking in exotic animals.
Laboratory testing of the respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods of detection of the presence of the virus and methods of detection of antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by the OTCR, which recognises the coronvirus RNA.
This test is specific and intended only for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm enough recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for the purpose of population control.
Antiquities analyses identify the number of people who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to treat them in the hospital or were not at all present.
The exact level of mortality from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, no reliable data on the prevalence of the virus were available in any country due to limited testing capacity.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population and information on the number of tests carried out in different countries was very contradictory.
Such differences in information are likely to have a significant impact on registered mortality rates, which may be significantly exaggerated in some countries.
With a polymeric chain reaction of real-time transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be carried out on samples of respiratory pathways obtained in different ways, including nostalgia masks or wet model.
The results are usually available for a period of several hours to 2 days.
The OTC-PCR test carried out in the guts taken from the throat is only valid during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, yet still reproduce in the lungs.
In infected patients tested for the second week of the disease, materials may be taken from the lower respiratory tract by means of a decontamination catheter or can be used as an alternative.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at Sharita, Berlin, in January 2020 using a polymeric chain reaction with real-time transcription (rRT-PCR) and a set of 250,000 sets that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a set of findings for SARS-CoV-2 based on the Clinical Level PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
It identifies “E” gene, common for all beta-coronaviruses, and RdRp gene, specific for SARS-CoV-2. China’s BGI Group has become one of the first companies authorised by China’s National Drug Administration for the emergency use of the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PC. In the United States, the Disease Control and Prevention Centre (CDC) distributes its diagnostic panel for real-time RT-PCR (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from the oldest versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to married reagents and the narrow test area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples were successfully processed during the whole of February 2020.
Two-component tests were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date were public and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Medicinal Control Authority under the emergency authorisation. The US commercial laboratories started testing early in March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection on the basis of RT-PCRs across the country.
The Quest Diagnostics started testing at COVID-19 across the country as of 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were declared; the collection and processing of analyses should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, a COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virus and Biotechnology “VECTOR”.
On 11 February 2020, it was reported that on 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for the use of a test that can be conducted for 3.5 hours in large quantities, allowing one machine to process approximately 4128 tests for 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency permit for Abbott laboratories to carry out tests on Abbott m2000; previously, FDA issued such a permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020 Cepheid also receives the USA from the FDA for a test duration of about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test using the technology for the amplification of isothermic nucleic acid instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cooling cycles, this method can detect positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Today, Taiwan is developing a test using a monoclonal antibody, which is specifically linked to the nucleocapsid protein (N-white) of the new coronavirus, and there is hope for results within 15 to 20 minutes, such as a flu test.
The review of the specialized literature for March 2020 concludes that “the X-rays of the brain cell have little diagnostic value at the early stages, while the results of the CT [computer tomography] may have such value even before symptoms occur”.
The typical signs identified during the CTC include bilateral multi-dimensional sub-floor focusses of mating glass type with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterior distribution.
Sudden domination, the symptom of stormy bridges and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
The results of the study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Uhana at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT was much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonia processes and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation “not to use CT for boxing or as a first line test method in the COVID-19 diagnosis”. As of March 2020 for the original CDC box, it is recommended that the PCR method be used.
A partial immune response to infection is expressed in the development of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after the 7th day of symptoms, to identify immunity and to carry out population control.
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-production automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
The CLT usually uses one specimen of peripheral blood, although serial samples may also be used to track the immune response.
In PACT, one blood sample is usually given through the perforation of each cover.
Unlike PCR methods, the blood collection phase is not required for sampling. On 26 March 2020, FDA named 29 organizations that have passed all necessary registration procedures and can now pass their tests on the antibodies.
As of 7 April 2020, the FDA approved only one emergency clearance test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for using their test kits, which can be detected in IgG and IgA antibody blood samples capable of combating the virus.
The production of the test is several hundred samples over several hours and therefore this method works much faster than the normal PCR analysis of the virus RNA.
The antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the kits it acquired for the analysis of the antibodies did not produce satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a schedule was developed to allow patients with a suspected virus to stay at home: “Immediate assistance officers are sending a sample sample to the patient”, the patient floats in, returns and receives the test results for a while. The British NHS announced the launch of its pilot examination of suspected cases in the home environment, which addresses the risk of infection by other clinic visitors, or the need to disinfect the machine of emergency care if used for the patient’s transport. In case of suspicious cases, a medical worker is being analysed using all appropriate precautions.
The expression test centres helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than in any other country. On 2 March, the National Association of Doctors for Compulsory Medical Insurance stated that they were ready to conduct some 12,000 tests a day in ambulatory conditions and only 10,700 tests a week earlier.
If the survey is appointed by a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to President Robert Koh, Germany ' s overall test productivity is 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, it was proposed to conduct an expression test in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests submitted in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that at SARS-CoV-2 as a calendar week 12/2020, at least 483 295 analyses were taken, including by week 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9%) were positive. Researchers at the Israeli Clinic Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken by 64 patients, combining samples and carrying out further analyses only if the combined sample showed a positive result. In Uhana on 5 February 2020, BGI opened a temporary laboratory at 2000 sq. m. on finding emergency cases under the name “Ho-Jan” (the Chinese model showing a positive result).
The construction of the laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Van Xyan and completed in only 5 days; the modeling showed that if the laboratory had not been operated at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of disease in Hubea would have been 47 per cent higher, and therefore quarantine costs would also have been twice as high.
After the opening of the laboratory in Uhana, the laboratories Huo-Jan were immediately opened in Shenzhen, Tianzzin, Beijing and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities in China.
By 4 March 2020, the daily total capacity ratios were 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays had been released with open multiplex schemes that can test up to 1,22 patient analyses on COVID19 using only 93 samples.
By March, due to the lack and insufficient number of reagents, mass testing in the EU, Britain and the United States had become problematic.
As a result, some authors have referred to test-sample protocols, which provide for the heating of samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes in order to release RNA genes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the number of coronavirus tests carried out by the United Arab Emirates per capita is higher than that of any other country, and that the majority of the population will soon be tested.
This has been done by means of an expression test, together with the acquisition of Group 42 and BGI mass testing laboratories (based on their Hoo-Jan emergency detection laboratories in China).
This laboratory, which has been deployed for 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world's first laboratory of such a large scale that works outside China.
Various testing options were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of the test kits that are sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the health and epidemiological centres of the United States was not available until 28 January, leading to the lack of testing kits in the United States. At the beginning of the outbreak in China and the United States, there were problems with the reliability of the kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough kits recommended by health experts.
And here in South Korea, experts claim, the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of a new coronary virus.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has been working on providing testing facilities, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programmes as the best way to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increase in the demand for rapid virus proliferation, many private United States laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of samples of analysis, were overloaded, and the stockpiles of brain and chemical reagents were rapidly drained.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by CDC were “deficient” and for this reason the Government removed the bureaucratic barriers that interfered with private test development. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of these kits were inadequate.
The company explained that the reasons for the inaccuracies of the results could be a failure to pick up samples or incorrect use of sets.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would respond to the incorrect results set and replace them with other sets of Shenzhen Bioeasy sets. 80 per cent of the test sets that the Czech Republic has acquired in China had incorrect results. 1.2 million test sets acquired by Slovakia in China were also found to be incorrect.
Prime Minister Matovic proposed that they be dropped in Danube. Ates Kara, a member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had “high level of errors” and the Ministry “did not get to use them”. The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was announced that these kits were not suitable for use.
Quarantine measures for persons whose analyses have had a positive outcome on SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring of the people contacted by such patients had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where for the first time in Italy, a man died from COVID-19, conducted two testing cycles of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of approximately ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed disease were quarantined.
Entry into the territory of the population was closed, and this measure had completely halted the spread of the infection.
In the context of intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine of the 2020 pandemic in Singapore, there was much less stress than in other developed countries, and there was no need to impose such extreme restrictions as forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many activities were canceled there, and on 28 March Singapore began to urge the residents to stay at home, but the schools that ended on 23 March were opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine, but are less aggressive.
The statistical study showed that in countries where more deaths were tested, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries had been able to identify more patients with poor symptoms or lack of symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results to COVID-19 in one of 16 WHO control laboratories to confirm testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the next schedule, the indicators of the column ‘positive results’ depend on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.
The country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result in percentages than the country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the symptoms of the virus, under other equal conditions.
Hand wash, also known as hand hygiene, is a process of cleaning hands to remove contamination, fats, microorganisms or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hands with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by faecal or oral means.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or normal cold, such as eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. loosely wrapped) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day after which the hands should be washed with soap: before and after the disinfection, after washing the child's ovaries or changing the pans, before feeding the child, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and domestic birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with Zola. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after treatment for a sick person.
After changing the towels or washing the child in the toilet.
After snoring, coughing or snoring.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
The health care of the hands is related to medical procedures.
The washing of hands before taking medicines or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of washing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other micro-organisms capable of causing diseases) as well as from chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are preparing food or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Washing hands is very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronary virus and other infectious diseases, prevents infections of the diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces infant mortality among domestic women.
The 2013 study showed that better hand washing can lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoean diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure is able to reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular hand washing reminders can reduce the number of diarrhoeas to about three, and this is comparable to the benefit of low-income regions of clean water.
The reduction in diarrhoea by 48 per cent may be related to washing hands with soap; washing hands with soap is the only way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (ORS) while developing appropriate habits in each house, in schools and other community places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of the ORI, is the major cause of death among children under the age of five who live about 1.8 million children a year.
Of diarrhoea and pneumonia, almost 3.5 million children are killed each year.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after meals, which have become a solid habit, can save more lives than any individual vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the mortality from diarrhoea almost twice and the mortality from acute respiratory infections to four.
The hand mill is usually combined with other sanitary activities carried out under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The hands also prevent the onset of impetitis, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent washing is that it can lead to skin drying and, therefore, to damage it.
The Danish study in 2012 showed that too often washing hands can lead to the swelling and swelling of the skin — a disease known as an eczema or dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too often hand washing can also be considered an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important for reducing the risk of faecal or oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (suspension, defecation), after washing the baby’s stomachs (change of pancreas), before feeding the child, before taking food and before/after preparing or processing raw meat, fish or birds.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after cutting or wound treatment, after brushing, coughing or sucking, after touching the waste of animal origin or animals, after touching the debris.
In many countries, hand washing procedures have been limited.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 showed that on average 38.7 per cent of myeloma wash families were in general practice. The 2014 study showed that the highest rate, 97 per cent, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the United States was close to the average, 77 per cent; the lowest rate was recorded in China – 23 per cent. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing myeloma washing and making habits in critical situations. In developing countries, the group washing of myeloma at school is one of the methods used to assist children in this process.
“A programme of emergency medical care”, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of large-scale activities to strengthen child health and improve the education of children.
This national programme is based on degelminization, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fan.
The same programme is being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from each cover is more effective if the washing process adds soap or wax.
The main action of mills and mills is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water itself is not considered to be an effective means of skin cleaning, as fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollutants, are badly dissolved in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the treatment process.
Durable soap may also contain bacteria that may fall on it during previous use.
A small number of studies on the fall in each roof of the bacteria from the contaminated piece of solid honey show a low probability of the fall, since the bacteria are depleting with the penis.
The CPC still claims that “no soap with a manual doser is a preferred option for hand washing”.
Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in health-care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended contraceptives or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains distributed antibacterial agents, such as triclosane, to which a sustainable number of resistant strains of organisms are present.
Thus, even if the strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to the antibacterial mill, their effectiveness may not be consistent with the advertising.
In addition to surface-active substances and skin protection products, complex compounds may contain acids (sex, ascorbic, milky) as an RN regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other fertilisers (aloe faith, vitamins, mantol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that in order to prevent diseases and remove bacteria from the skin, simple varieties of soap were as effective as normal antibacterial soap containing triclozan.
Hot water comfortable for human skin is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria reproduce much faster at the body temperature of 37°C.
However, warmer water is more effective than cold to remove natural fats that contain contamination and bacteria.
Despite the widespread view, scientific studies have shown that the use of hot water does not affect the reduction of the microbial load on the hands.
Hand disinfectant (sanitizer) or hand antiseptic is a hand-held non-water disinfectant.
At the end of the 1990s and early in the 21st century, the use of alcohol-free hands (also known as alcohol-based hand disinfectants, antiseptic hands disinfectants or sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with additives such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in gel, or moisturizers such as glycerin in liquid or pen, which ensure ease of use and reduce the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen rehydration further increases antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing at least 60-95 per cent alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza and hepatitis) and flu.
Disinfectants containing 70 per cent of alcohol kill 99.97 per cent of the bacteria (logarithm of reduction 3.5 similar to 35 decibels) in the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99 per cent to 99.999 per cent of the bacteria (logarithm of reduction 4-5) in the hands 1 minute after use. Disinfectants for the hands are most effective against the bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol disinfectants are virtually ineffective against neurovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of the infection gastroenteritis. A sufficient amount of antiseptic or alcohol-containing agents should be used to treat and deliver skin from both sides.
The face and back surface of the two Ladders, as well as the space between the fingers, shall grow for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, penis or gel is fully absorbed.
The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centre recommends that the use of disinfectants should be used instead of the use of disinfectants, especially if the hands are severely contaminated.
The increase in the popularity of such disinfectants is due to the simple use and rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be replaced for complete washing of hands if there is a chance of water and soap.
The frequent use of alcohol-based disinfectants may cause skin dryness if their composition does not contain softening agents and/or moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other softening substances.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based disinfectants containing softening components caused significantly less distension and dryness of the skin than soap or antimicrobial motives.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact dropper syndrome or hypersensitive to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are virtually absent.
The lower likelihood of a disturbing contact dermatitis was a factor in the choice of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water resources do not wash their hands from organic substances but simply disinfect them.
That is why hand disinfectants are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms, such as ordinary soap and water, as they still remain in the hands of pathogens.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic disinfectants depends to a large extent on components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol.
It has recently been demonstrated that the medicinal products used with chloride benzalkonium have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to lose efficacy after multiple use, probably due to advanced side effects.
Many people in low - income communities cannot afford to be gentle and replace it with gold or clay.
Zola or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or gold is contaminated by microorganisms, it may, on the other hand, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, gold is a disinfectant, since when it comes to water, it produces a secretion.
If soap is unavailable, WHO recommends the use of gold or sand as an alternative.
In order to prevent infection of the U.S. Disease Control Centre, it is recommended that handwashing techniques include the following steps:
Wash your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that water flows because standing water can be contaminated, and this is the temperature of the water.
Help your hands by raising them with a large number of soaps, including the back of the laundromats, as well as the area between fingers and feet.
Milk removes the microbes from the skin, and studies show that using soap (not just one water) people tend to wash their hands more carefully.
Three hands at least 20 seconds.
Exercise helps remove the microbes from the skin, and the longer the third hand, the more microbes are removed.
Gently wash your hands under running water.
Re-infection may be caused by hand-adhesion in standing water.
Wash your hands with clean hands, or let them dry themselves.
Wet and wet hands are more contaminated, and most often people leave such areas as large fingers, wrists, and fingernails without attention.
The artificial nails and the shimmering nails for the nails can contain a number of microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing rod to prevent the drying of the hands, which may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If water and soap are not available, there are many different low-cost ways to wash hands: water discharges from hanging canisters or bottlenecks with opened openings and/or the use of salt, if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. In areas with limited water supply (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries) there are water-saving solutions such as foot-and-mouthed cranes and other low-cost options.
It is a simple structure made up of a rope hanging from a rope and a knife that should be pressed to pour water into the hands, using a piece of soap.
Effective hands dry is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there are some disputes about the most effective form of dry cleaning in public toilets.
The growing volume of research shows that paper pickers are much more hygienic than hand dryers, which are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Soils and Poultry; this study compared the level of hygiene of paper poultices, hand-held dryers and more modern hand-held liquids.
It was found that after washing and drying the hands in the hot air dry cleaner, the total number of bacteria in the fingertips on average increased by 194 per cent and 254 per cent in the lorries.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in the air-flow dry cleaner, the total number of bacteria in the fingertips increased by 42 per cent and 15 per cent in the ponds.
After washing and dry hands, the total number of bacteria in the fingertips is reduced to 76% and in the laundromats to 77%. Scientists have also tested the possibility of cross-contamination of several visitors to the toilets and the toilet environment in each type of dry area.
The air-dryer, which emits air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 miles/h), is capable of draining micro-organisms from their hands and from their own block and potentially infecting other users of the bathroom and toilet in the radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of hand dryers with warm air spreads micro-organisms in the radius up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
In 2005, TÜV Product und Umwelt carried out a study on the evaluation of various methods of dry hands.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the dry hands method:
There are many different producers of towels for hands, and towels for hands are compared to dry paper dishes.
Cleaning hands with disinfectants can be an alternative in the absence of soap and water.
The disinfectant should contain at least 60 per cent of alcohol.
The medical method of washing hands became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignatz Zemmelweis found it to be highly effective (in 1846) in preventing disease in stationary conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget about it.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps to reduce the level of infection.
Medical washing takes at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and remove each part of the hand.
Your hands should be scolding each other with your fingers.
If there is a scratch under your feet, you can use the damage to remove it.
Since the microbes can remain in the water present on their hands, it is important to wash them thoroughly and wipe them out with a clean dish.
After drying hands, closing the crane and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, a paper seal should be used.
This prevents the contamination of the hands again from these surfaces.
The aim of washing hands in medical facilities is to remove pathogens (microbials) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the order of washing of hands remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before contacting patients and thus spread microorganisms.
As a result of one study, correct washing of hands and other basic procedures may reduce the level of catheter-related infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a standard washing and hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-washing-to-to-washing-washing-washing-washing-to-to-to-deing-parting-to--to-parting-parts servicesing servicesing servicesing servicesing servicesing servicesing servicesing services-de service-washing was serviceability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability services-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-abilitying-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-abilitying-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-de servicess servicess servicess-s has tossssssssss-s has to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-s to to to to to to to to to to-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-ability-s-s to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-to-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of- of- of- of-of- of-of-of- of-of-of-of- of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of- of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-ofer-of-of-of-per-per-per-of-of-of-of-char-of-of-of-char-cha-////////////////////////////r- of- of-r-r-per-lets-lets-r-r-letss-lets-ofer-of-ofer-ofer-ofer- of-of-of-of-ofer- of- of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of- of-ofer-ofer-ofer- of- of- of- of-rsabler- of------------ of- of-ofer- of-lets-lets- of-lets-----lets-lets------lets-lets and to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to
The WHO Manual on Health Care is also available on its website and is open for public discussion.
The corresponding review was conducted by Whitby in co-authority.
Where compliance with the regulatory requirements is required, commercial devices may be used to measure the indicators and check the hygiene.
The World Health Organization represents “five points” when it is necessary to wash hands:
After contact with blood or biological fluids,
prior to use of antiseptics, as well as
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to myeloma by washing hands (medicine or antimicrobial myloma) helps destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be required prior to surgery or in the environment of organisms resistant to antibiotics. To “clean” hands before surgery, a crane can be included and excluded without the use of any hand; a little chlorhexidine or iodine should also be used to soften hands, dry hands after washing, sterile damage to the train and other sterile tool for cleaning under the feet.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and pre-locks normally for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to shake your hands too long, for example, 10 minutes.
At the time of application, water with premixtures should not fall back on the brush of hands.
After the washing is done, the hands dry with sterile cloth and put on a surgical coat.
To reduce the spread of microbes, better wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after treatment for the sick.
In order to combat Staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20 per cent of the wash was the most beneficial, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the handwashing rate was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared with antibacterial soap, handwashing with conventional soap has resulted in more than three-fold increases in the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted through food. The comparison of handwashing with antibacterial soap and handwashing with antibacterial soap showed that hand-washing with alcohol has reduced bacterial contamination by 26 per cent compared to antibacterial soap in an average of 30 seconds per procedure.
However, soap and water are more effective than hand-washing solutions, in order to reduce the amount of flu A H1N1 virus and the Clostridium difficile dispute. Health care activities in medical institutions may include training of hand-washing personnel, improving the availability of hand-washing solutions, and written and oral reminders to staff about the need to wash hands.
Further research is needed on the most effective types of measures in various health institutions.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as an economically effective and important means of improving health and even food.
However, the lack of stable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities at home, in schools and in workplaces makes it difficult to get used to washing hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are not far from each private or public toilet to wash hands, although there are also cheap ways to organize wash hands in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene can also be caused by roots rather than by a lack of soap or water.
The promotion and encouragement of hand washing can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefit of hand washing and lead to long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, results should be monitored and evaluated.
A system analysis of 70 studies found that, in order to improve the health situation in low-income countries, effective community-level health and epidemic monitoring, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of the promotion of school wash is the approach of the United Nations Children's Fund Three Star Approach: it promotes the implementation of simple economic measures in schools that encourage washers to wash their hands using soap, as well as other health requirements.
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can increase their level from one to three stars.
The establishment of handicrafts is one of the possible measures implemented in the context of hand-held information campaigns to reduce the level of disease and child mortality.
The World Hand Washing Day (Global Hand Washing Day) is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund is promoting the use of emotions symbolizing washing hands.
Some studies considered the overall effectiveness of washing hands in developing countries compared to the DALYs (saved years of life without disability).
One study, however, suggests that washing hands with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of washing hands for human health — especially for vulnerable groups, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized by two in the middle of the 19th century in the field of hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Sammelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), working in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale (Florence Nightingale), an English nurse and “the founder of modern care for the sick”.
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotting smells called miasms.
In the 1980s, as a result of outbreaks of food-borne diseases and infections related to medical care, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have become more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have improved their understanding of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, handicrafts in public toilets, as well as office buildings and airports, were decorated with “good hand washing techniques”.
The phrase “to wash your hands” means to show your unwillingness to accept responsibility for something or to be a party to something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate “washed his hands ” in deciding on Jesus Christ’s enthronement; then this phrase became more widely used in some English communities.
In the play "Macbeth" Shakespeare, Lady Mcbeth begins to wash her hands in an inexhaustible way in an attempt to purify herself from the imaginary Friday, symbolizing an unclean conscience, in connection with the crimes she committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed any non-ethical action tend to wash their hands more often than others, and handcuffs were more important to them.
Also, it is less likely that people who have the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing them will participate in any other “cleaning” compensating activities, such as volunteer activities.
In religions the washing of hands is both hygienic and symbolic. The symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap, is a part of the ritual prescribed in many religions, including Bahiaism, Indusism, Tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe the washing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam required compulsory washing of their hands after a visit to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
Control of production factors in the context of COVID-19 involves the use of methods for occupational safety and health in order to control the risk and control of coronal viruses in 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate control of workplace risks depends on the place and job, based on risk assessment, the severity of the community epidemic and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The United States Office for Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) reported that lower-risk positions have minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures are required to combat infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home on the signs of illness, compliance with the respiratory label, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The medium-risk duties require frequent or close contact with persons with no confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, but there is a likelihood of infection due to the current spread of disease in society or during international travel.
Such categories may include public-contact workers, such as schools, high-density working environments and some large retail shops.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to the basic measures to prevent infection, include exposure using high-efficiency air filters, the use of protective screens and the availability of personal protection in the event of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that medical personnel and morgues in contact with a person with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of co-infection are high-risk categories; this increases the risk to a very high level in the conduct of aerosol education procedures, or the collection/processing of human samples with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of co-VID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such staff include the use of engineering and safety equipment, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task.
The explosion of COVID-19 may result in different types of effects on the workplace.
Workers may not be at work because of their own illness, the need to care for others or because of the fear of possible infection.
Commercial templates may vary in terms of both the types of goods on which demand is available and the means by which such goods are acquired (e.g. purchases in non-peak times with delivery or maintenance without leaving the car).
Finally, the delivery of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19 may be affected. The Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan can be used to provide protection.
The plans address risks related to different workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors occurring at home and in communities, as well as risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic diseases.
Plans also identify the means of monitoring the risks involved, as well as emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Plans for preparedness and response may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the objectives of response to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus to staff, to protect people at greater risk of serious health difficulties, to maintain business operations and to minimize negative impacts on other organizations in their supply chains.
The severity of the diseases in the community where there is a business is affected by the response.
The risk control hierarchy is a structure widely used in the provision of safety and health care to group such funds according to efficiency.
In the absence of the possibility of eliminating the risk of the COVID-19 disease, the most effective engineering and technical means of safety, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.
Engine safety means that staff are isolated from work-related risk areas and do not rely on the employee ' s behaviour, which can be the most economically beneficial solution.
Administrative measures entail changes in labour policies or procedures requiring action by an employee or an employee.
Personal protection funds (PPE) are considered to be less effective than technical or administrative measures, but may help to address some risks.
All types of personnel protection should be selected depending on the threat to the worker, be approached by size (e.g. breathers), be used regularly and properly, be checked regularly, maintained and replaced as necessary, and be properly removed, cleaned and stored or used to avoid infection.
The United States Office for Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) believes that the minimum risk positions have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough washing of hands, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with the respiratory label, including the closing of the mouth with cough and sneezing, the provision of soaps and containers for garbage, the readiness to work away or change, where necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as the day-to-day cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of persons who may be potentially infected is a critical step to protect workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that staff with acute respiratory symptoms remain at home until the heat is stopped, the absence of increased body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of anti-fungal drugs or other medications that remove symptoms, and prescribe the flexibility of hospital policies, allow staff to stay at home to care for the sick family member and to inform staff about such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-level positions require frequent and close contact of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with persons with no confirmed data or suspicions of infection with COVID-19, but there is a likelihood of infection with SARS-COV-2 with regard to the spread of disease in the business territory or with the recent visits of such a person to the place of distribution of COVID-19.
These categories include gender-sensitive workers, for example, in schools, the working environment with high population density and some major retail stores. The technical and safety tools for such groups and groups at higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation intensity, the installation of physical barriers, such as transparent plastic protection screens, and the installation of a toilet for customer service without leaving the car. The administrative measures for such group and higher risk group include the recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of personal meetings for communication with virtual means, the installation of the gender, the installation of the gender, the installation of the gender, the installation of the gender, the installation of the gender, the installation of the gender, the installation of the gender, the installation of the gender and the gender of the gender, the installation of the gender, the installation of the gender, the gender and the gender of the gender of the gender, the gender, the gender of the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender of the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the institution, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the institution, the gender, the gender, the gender, the institution, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the institution, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the institution, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the institution, the institution, the., the., the., the., the institution, the., the institution, the gender, the gender, the gender, the institution, the., the gender, the gender, the who, the who, the..., the gender, the gender, the gender, the who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who, the who or the who who who who, the who, the who, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the institution, the gender, the institution, the institution, the gender, the employment, the institution, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the relationship, the institution, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the institution, the institution, the gender, the gender, the institution, the gender, the institution, the institution, the institution, the institution, the institution, the gender, the institution, the institution, the gender, the institution, the institution, the institution, the institution, the gender, the institution, the gender, the institution, the gender, the gender, the gender, the gender, the agency, the agency, the agency, the agency, the agency, the agency, the agency, the gender, the gender, the gender, the agency, the event, the event, the event, the event, the event, the gender, the event, the event, the event, the event, the who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who or the Agency, the agency, the event, the event, the agency, the event, the event, the event or the agency, the meeting, the agency, the event, the agency, the event, the Elijah who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who or the event, the event, the Elijah, the Agency, the Agency, the Elijah, the event or the Elijah, the event or the event or the Elijah, the event or the Elijah, the event or the Agency for the Agency for the Agency for the Agency for the Agency, the Agency, the Agency, the Agency, the event or the event or the Agency for the Agency for the meeting, the agency or the agency or the agency or the Agency, the event or the event, the
In rare cases, workers in such a risk group may be required to carry their breathers.
In order to ensure adequate safety of workers and other passengers, measures are required, such as the isolation of the sick person from other people at 6 feet, the appointment of a member of the sick person ' s care crew, the provision of a sick mask or the treatment of such a person with a request to cover his nose and mouth with a walnut or sneezing.
The second-stage crew shall wear one-time medical gloves when approaching the sick traveler or when confronted with physical fluids or potentially infected surfaces and possibly additional personal protection, if in pain, regular cough or difficulty breathing.
Used pens and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and the contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. In cases of commercial navigation, including cruise liners and other passenger ships, safety measures include the delay of travel in the event of illness, self-insulation and the immediate information of the medical centre on board when there is heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should be carried out in an isolated cabin of such a person; in the case of schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends that a short-term closure be made for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or average level of distribution of infection in the community, social remoteness strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of trips for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as exercise of physics or singing, food intake in cafeterias, increased distance between parties, adjustment of arrival and care, limiting unnecessary visits, the use of separate locations of health institutions for children with flu symptoms.
At a significant rate of distribution in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, long-term school absence measures may be considered; for law enforcement officials carrying out daily duties, direct health risks are considered to be low, according to the CDC.
Staff members of the law enforcement authorities, who are obliged to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of co-infection, are advised to follow the same instructions as those prescribed for rapid assistance campaigners, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their formal sleeves and equipment before re-use by house cleaning aerosols or by spraying, comply with standard operating procedures for preventing the spread of disease and the use of the used personal protective equipment, as well as for the use and use of clothes.
OSHA believes that some categories of health institutions and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical assistance, support, laboratory and medical transportation personnel who contact patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection in the conduct of aerosol education procedures or in the collection/processing of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures accompanying aerosol education include screening, procedures for cassettes, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and surveys or sampling by invasive methods.
High-risk Mortgage Officers include staff dealing with confirmed disease or suspicion of co-infection at the time of their death; if such staff are exposed, they fall into a very high-risk category. Additional engineering and safety equipment for such risk groups include the use of isolated facilities for patients with confirmed disease or co-inspection, including in the conduct of aerosol education procedures.
In some health and morgue institutions, the use of special ventilation with negative pressure may be an effective measure.
Tests should be carried out in accordance with the precautions for biological safety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that future patients be allocated to separate waiting zones depending on the suspicion of coovid-19 infection. In addition to other personnel protection measures, OSHA recommends that workers who work longer than 6 ft with confirmed disease or SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as persons conducting aerosol education procedures, should be used.
In the United States, NIOSH approved respirators for N95 or higher-grade individuals should be used in an integrated written programme on respirator protection, which specifies the requirements for individual selection of funds and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the staff member. WHO does not recommend the use of special care, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not due to physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks should be used for patient screening personnel.
WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, protective eyes or protective screen for the person, coat and cover for persons, persons who collect respiratory samples from patients with COPID-19 or those who carry this disease without procedures accompanied by aerosol education.
In case of aerosol education procedures, the N95 or FFP2 Respirator should be carried instead of the surgical mask.
In view of the lack of individual protection resources around the world, WHO recommends that such protections be minimized by the use of remote medical facilities, physical barriers, such transparent scars, access to a patient infected with COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, the use of only those personal protection funds that are necessary for a specific purpose, the continued use of the same respirator, without taking away, in the work of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection funds and the recommendation not to use masks for persons with no symptoms.

Topic: [Covid-19] Relief of load and preparation for the future
Date/Time of operation: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
RESOLUTION: CC0: No protected rights
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the relationships between people of the world and our responsibility to one another.
We have had no precedents for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to feel, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is the basis for such an organization.
We have observed friendly and caring relationships among all our colleagues, as reflected in electronic correspondence, phone calls, and chats — a remarkable confirmation of the fact that fortunate people work with us.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as my colleagues.
Last week, I was told that our work was highly appreciated.
I was reminded how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia right now and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible because of your work, whether it is to ensure the functionality of sites, to pay for our colleagues or to protect the safety of communities.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and it is even more important today than ever before.
In order to achieve significant results for peace, it is important not only what we do but also how we do it.
With regard to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make significant changes in the order of our joint work, starting next week.
Adjusting the order of our work and timetables
As Robin said earlier, the "c-team" team gathered yesterday evening to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During the communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The overwhelming majority of us wanted to remove tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to step back, it'll be like that.
For all staff, contractors and foreign staff:
In our expectations, we will need to work around 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before the subsequent orders are received.
We do not announce the dates of departure: if you can work normally for more hours, this will be permitted for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs are, whether you are caring for your family, buying food, or going to the doctor’s office, your well - being is our priority number one.
We're not watching your work hours.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
That's understandable and clear, but we're talking about it.
There is no need to form a hospital letter or a response: just inform your manager and help the team review the calendar and schedule to ensure that the key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, report to Brian from T&C Ops, so that T&C can provide support and attention from the guidance to your situation).
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and confirmed our intention to comply with the obligations of our contractors and hourly staff.
Each person will be paid at normal hourly rates under normal circumstances.
This means, in particular, periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts around us.
What we do can bring amazing results, especially at such times.
And again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to contact our leader so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
We must always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising teams (including others) are doing critical work for which additional support may be required.
We are launching a process for all units to assess the current objectives and to shift the emphasis on support, which is extremely important for our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we are simply focusing on the most important projects.
The delay today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work “two more to turn the missing” after the end of the pandemic.
You will not need to work overtime to meet the unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and that we will work on setting new goals and deadlines, as far as possible.
What about the APP (annual plans)?
To build on the new reality and expectations of daily working time, we intend to adjust the time frame for the implementation of our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of the time limit for our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, which will allow staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for their loved ones, while all those who need or want to work will have a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
Such an extension of the time limit would significantly reduce the current planning and tension burden throughout the organization.
The following week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, provide relevant information to representatives and teams on the following steps immediately after receipt of the relevant confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for the leadership role in this work.
Status of office, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected with a COVID-19 virus.
In addition to many precautions, however, we have hired an anti-virus clearance team to disinfect all the surfaces in the office in San Francisco.
They used anti-virus solutions of the medical class to disinfect all surfaces, as well as acceptable and elevator halls through which access to our floor is possible.
The building applies its own rules, which require caution, using products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared by the time we decide to return.
Our office in the province of Colombia (DC) is located on the WeWork network, which has shared with us and all the staff in the DC with its COVID-19 rules.
Last week, our office in the district of Colombia completely moved to remote work in accordance with the instructions of San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the rental of a room in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work far away for the first time.
Our old colleagues, who work far away, know about the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings should be limited to one or two hours.
If necessary, consider the possibility of dividing them into a course of several days.
You will clearly define the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and the material for the briefing.
By default, use video, to facilitate interaction and communication, use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, select the coordinator, the person who will track the conversation and monitor the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for the performance of the notes (or joint viewing).
If necessary, contact the technical support service via e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program when buying snacks.
Connect to the #remotes channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about the distributed work.
The HR Operations team examines the management of ergonomics available in the form of web sites to promote the effectiveness of distributed work throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel the mass activities funded by Wikimedia, such as “editathons”, until the WHO announced the completion of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may lead to the impossibility of carrying out concerted grants activities, and no one will be penalized for any delays or changes in such objectives.
Next week, we will conduct follow-up activities with additional guidance on Wikimania as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
General attitudes in the global community are not only aggrieved by the interruption of work, but also some sense of relief from understanding and the possibility of focusing on their own communities, Wikimedia and not only.
With regard to prospects, CRT is working on the Meta-Wiki page, which will provide space for the community to monitor impact and society.
We remain in touch with issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special meeting of staff to be held on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07/00 PT.
This time we take the opportunity to further share relevant information, answer your questions, and spend time together, connecting with each other.
We are in this situation together, and we are ready to help everyone as much as we can.
You can continue to receive information from such an electronic correspondence and other important information about COVID-19 from Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have had a significant impact on the current situation.
In case of travel issues, activities, key workflows, information awareness issues or other assistance, contact the CRT.
We are ready to support and communicate as necessary.
If there are issues of confidentiality, please contact the Director of HR International Global Operations by e-mail to Brian Judean (Bryan Juden).
No such change should be seen as a rejection of our work and our obligations.
Rather, it recognizes the potential current need for the radical new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support one another and to ensure that work continues, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the whole world through the necessary service.
Our planning work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support each other and to create space for important work in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
To do so, we will need help from each one of you; and we need you to be able to care for yourself and your families, as well as to work with the greatest impact as soon as that need arises.
Now, please, help your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the other participants in Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells in light, arteries, hearts, hips and aquifers.
ACE2 opposes the activity of the relevant angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), reducing angiotensin-II content and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution to treat cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a point of entry into the cells for some coronary viruses.
The human version of the farm is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metallic ester located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
Belok ACE2 contains N-concealed peptide domain M2 and C-concealed transport domain of the renal amino acid collection.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane type I membrane, and its fermentedly active domain falls on the surface of the cells of light and other tissues.
The ACE2 is separated from the trans-embedded domain by another enzyme known as sedase and the solvent protein obtained is released into the blood and is finally released from the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most light type II alveolar cells, thin urticaria enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
Biosynthesis ACE2 IRNC is also found in the main brain, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight of ACE.
ACE secretes the hormone angiotensin I into the adjacent angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, decomposes the carbon-oxylated amino-phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Heis-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also decompose a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral mineral carrier SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup’s disease.
As a transmissible protein, ACE2 serves as the primary point of entry into the cells for some coronary viruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-COV (virus causing SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (virus causing COVID-19).
In short, binding of the S1 strain of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain ACE2 on the cell surface leads to endocitosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme in the endosomes in the cells.
This entry also requires the administration of the S protein by the TMPRSS2 serum protease carrier, whose inhibition is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent, which has led some to the idea that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help fight infection.
However, many professional communities and governing bodies recommend that standard therapy be continued by AFP and BRA inhibitors.
According to the systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of AFP inducers was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared to the control group”.
Furthermore, “pneumonia risk has also been reduced in patients receiving AFP inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially in patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of PF-inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than those of patients at the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novelty in the treatment of mild injuries and seems to improve leguminous hemodynamics and oxygen saturation with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipo-isoscharides.
The human elimination half-life of rhaCE2 is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes apart from the duration of exposure at 24 hours.
Some data indicate that rACE2 can be a promising tool for people with a class-class renin-angiotensin-inhibitors (RAS-inhibitors) or with an increase in angiotensin II circulation. RACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials in the treatment of severe respiratory distress syndrome.
Annexes COVID-19 are applications for mobile phones intended to assist in epidemiological investigation in the context of the 2019-20 pandemic, i.e. identification of persons (“contacts”) who could contact the infected person.
In some regions, a number of applications have been developed or proposed, officially supported by the authorities.
Several applications have been developed to track contacts.
This led to a discussion of confidentiality issues, especially those systems based on the geographical location of users of the annexes.
The softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to register the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would unite their efforts to integrate the functional support of such applications through Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, developed an application that enables citizens to verify whether they were associated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore uses an application called TraceTogether.
The application has been developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be transmitted under the control of the Government.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the application was expected to register at Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the application for contact tracking is at the final stage of development and will be available for deployment for several weeks. Similar applications are planned to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the use of applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether annex and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an application with geozoning function, which aims to ensure that patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security, Cambridge University, points out a number of potential practical problems that may arise with annex systems, including fake design and potential inefficiency in the use of only a small part of the population.
Given the concern about the proliferation of misleading or harmful “coronavirus” annexes, Apple has limited the list of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related annexes to the App Store, including only “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon also imposed similar restrictions.
The participants expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance on the population through coronavirus-related annexes; in particular, the question was raised whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
The International Amnesty Organization and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the restriction of such oversight.
The organizations announced eight conditions for their submission to public projects:
Monitoring shall be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Increased monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by a limitation of the duration of action;
The use of data should be limited to the purpose of combating the spread of COVID-19;
The security and anonymity of the data shall be protected and evidence of such protection shall be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;
Any data exchange with third parties should be defined at the legislative level;
Protection against abuse should be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also published their lists.
Google and Apple offer their joint plan to address the problem of permanent monitoring, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems as soon as it is necessary.
In some countries, network tracking is used instead of annexes, which excludes the need to load the annex and the possibility to avoid tracking.
Network monitoring was approved in Israel.
Networking solutions that have access to baseline location data also have major potential confidentiality issues.
However, not all central servers systems should have access to location personal data; a number of confidentiality systems have been developed that use central servers only for communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using the special annex, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including data on tracking mobile devices and transactions with maps, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government not only used this information to warn citizens of potential contacts with the infected, but also provided information on the location of the public, which was possible due to significant changes in the protection of information legislation that had been introduced after the outbreak of the MERS in that country.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of annexes and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering the possibility of using both centralized and confidentiality systems.
As at 6 April 2020 details have not yet been published.
The tracking of contacts where confidentiality is maintained is a strong concept, a significant amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups worked on confidential solutions such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register the user's approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and are not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include a decentralized transmission with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols to ensure confidentiality, mechanisms to track mobile contacts (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for never leaving the device and all comparisons on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is involved in the development of SafePaths, a platform that ensures confidentiality in collecting and using data on location or intersection of ways to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the research presented in the “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” document, published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company that develops confidentiality technologies, which was also originally based on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies to enable users to exchange confidential location and health data with other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of these data.
On 5 April 2020, teams sharing the same approach and using similar protocols were founded by the TCN Global Coalition, which aims to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of applications for tracking and warning, which is a key factor in their widespread dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official annex.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that, as they claimed, would ensure confidentiality, which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography technology that enables confidentiality.
They also published technical characteristics of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
deployment of tools to enable Governments to establish official applications to track the movement of coronal virus-infected citizens, but to maintain confidentiality of data
Integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve problems with continuous monitoring, first introduced the system by updating the operating system, and then removed it in the same way after the threat disappeared.
Repositioning the medicinal product (also known as re-profile, re-arrangement, task change or therapeutic re-arrangement) is a re-profile of an approved medicinal product for the treatment of a disease or medical condition different from the disease originally intended for development.
This is one of the research directions that is currently being used to develop safe and effective methods of treating COVID-19.
Other studies include the development of a vaccine from COVID-19 and the transfer of recombinant plasma. SARS-COV-2 contains about 66 proteins that are affected by medicinal products, each of which has several binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites is an appropriate basis for the development of an effective antiviral agent against COPID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papayain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, gelicase, S protein and ADF-ribofosphatase.
Hussein AA and co-authors in their preclinical study examined several candidates' associations, which were then optimized, and analysed their similarity to the structure with the most similar approved products to accelerate the development of a highly effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 product, which would be recommended for clinical studies.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial agent that is also used to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine would be included in four medicinal products studied in the clinical trial of Solidarity.
The governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine tests would start in the state of New York on 24 March. On 28 March FDA authorised the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate in accordance with an emergency application permit (USA).
The treatment scheme has not been approved during the FDA clinical trial and is authorised in accordance with the US only as an emergency treatment for patients hospitalized but unable to receive treatment under clinical trials.
CDC stated that “the use, dosing or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when there is “no other way out”.
The Turkish research group in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Major studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University Medical School in Langone examines the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
The Chinese clinical trials in Uhana and Shenzhen showed that Fawipirvir was “uniquely effective”.
35 patients in Shenzhen who took this medicine had a negative result on average within 4 days, while 45 patients who did not take it had 11 days of disease.
A study was conducted in Uhana in which 240 patients with pneumonia, one half of whom received fawipirvir, and the other half, Umifenevir, were observed.
The Italian pharmaceutical authority reminded the public that the results of the product performance were poor and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase a drug in Japan to fill its stocks and that it would be delivered to universities where it would be used to treat patients with COPID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Sindzo Abe informed the Tramp Administration of the possibility of buying the product.
It may be dangerous for pregnant patients or for those trying to become pregnant.
A study on the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir (Caletera) antivirals concluded that “the effectiveness of the use of the drugs has not been identified”.
Preparations have been developed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to protease.
A group of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify medicinal products to find an association that will be associated with the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, there are criticisms of the reprofile of medicinal products that have been specially developed for HIV and AIDS therapy.
WHO included the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections.
One of the problems of antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that may lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies have shown that remedisvir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are currently being conducted, two of which are conducted by University Clinics in Cleveland; one is conducted in patients with moderate disease and the other in patients with more severe disease.
Three clinical trials are currently being conducted for the internal introduction of vitamin C for people hospitalized with severe COPID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On 24 March 2020, an antibiotic test of azithromycin began in the state of New York.

Phase II, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 test is conducted with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of disease to determine treatment effectiveness.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchic in reducing inflammation and legal complications in patients with poorly reported symptoms of COVID-19.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 had mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant and breast-feeding and do not use effective contraception cannot participate in this study.
There are several coagulants in the test in Italy.
Low molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which has prompted the Italian Medicines Authority to issue recommendations on the use of this medicinal product.
On 14 April, a multicentre study involving 300 patients on the use of enoxaparin sodium at preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a significant scientific focus has been focused on re-emergence of approved anti-virus drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics, such as Mers, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations.
Umifenevir: Umifenevir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been considered potentially suitable for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Tests also in Italy and China, see tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronvirus in 2019 (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has undergone clinical trials, many attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to be obtained before 18 months later.
In April, five vaccine candidates conducted Phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
A major outbreak of this disease spread worldwide in 2020, leading to significant investments in the development of the vaccine and research activities in its context.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI Vaccine Development Initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, widespread deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020 there were 10 different technological platforms to establish an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the Platforms included in the Phase I security study:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRNA-1273)
virus vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are used in approved active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute); in addition, 37 more vaccine candidates have been reported, but there is little public information available (probably they are in the planning or development stages).
Phase I-II pre-tests for safety and immunogenicity are usually randomized, placebo-controlled and at several points, with more accurate and effective doses at the same time.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including the control group; at this stage, preparations are tested for disease prevention and side effects are monitored at optimal doses.
Of the 79 active-designed vaccine candidates (as confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested per person (are still in the post-clinical phase).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a vaccine with a molecular tumor that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate immune response.

On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotech company, Quebec, reported that they had created a particle-like coronavirus in partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Studies.
The potential vaccine is being conducted in laboratory studies and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump proposed CureVac “large sums of money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, against which the German Government protested.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced that a partnership with the German company BioNTech would be established for the joint development of an IRNC vaccine.
BNT162 is a candidate for an IRNA vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing preclinical trials and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that in April 2020 it would receive the results of the pre-clinical tests, and their final vaccine candidate could start testing for people in autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Epidemic Innovation Coalition (CEPI), France, announced investment of $4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine consortium with the participation of Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and Pittsburgh University. The total CEPI investment in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine is $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovo, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-implicated CRF vaccine from COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate has been developed within 14 days of obtaining consistency from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of $275 million for 96 research projects on health countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine agents in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, for example, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans for the establishment of a national vaccine bank, where several new vaccines could be used in the event of a new outbreak of coronary disease.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the Pittsburgh University Medical School reported that PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 on mice, stated that “MNA introduced subunital SARS-CoV-2 S1, with strong responses to anti-specific antibodies [in mice] that occurred two weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian School of Pharmaceuticals of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential vaccine based on DNA, which may be released in the form of nasal spray.
Bacterial DNA will reproduce within human bacteria and produce harmless viral particles that can stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three U.S. universities pooled IBM supercomputers' resources together with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have other advantages in addition to disease prevention.
Another randomized study in Australia covers 4170 health workers.
Vaccines may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies on the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transigent mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for measures to prevent biosafety 3 infection in the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination of standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no medicinal products or protective vaccines for the treatment of SARS that would be safe and effective for people.
According to the research work published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicinal products for atypical pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world.
When Mers began to spread, it was considered that the SARS study, which was then conducted, could be a standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutic remedies against Mers-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS-based (DNA-based) vaccine that passed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines, all of which were virus-based vaccines and were in the process of development, two-adeneviruses (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one-MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
In social networks, the theory of a conspiracy was spread, claiming that the COVID-19 virus is not new and that the vaccine already exists.
Social media publications quoted the words of some patients who claimed that there were patents for the genetic sequences of other strains of coronavirus, such as coronavirus SARS, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by severe severe respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The most common symptoms include nausea, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of color, and pain in life.
The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also range from two to fourteen days.
Most cases have mild symptoms, but in some cases, the disease flows into viral pneumonia and polyorganic insufficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection were reported in 210 countries and regions, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured; the virus is mainly spread by close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops of air in coughing, sneezing or chatting.
Although these chapels are formed when they emerge, they usually pose a threat, either to the ground or to the surface, but not to air at long distances.
People are also infected with contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is the most infected during the first three days after symptoms occur, although its spread may be possible both before symptoms occur and at a later stage. The standard diagnostic method is a polymeric chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a bone marrow.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspected disease, as well as for those who follow them.
The recommendations for the use of medical masks vary from population to population: some agencies recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use, and others require them.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment of the virus COVID-19.
The local distribution of the disease has been registered in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infectious people may have no symptoms or flu symptoms, such as nausea, cough, fatigue, and swelling.
Exterior symptoms include difficulty in breathing, persistent pain or feeling depressed in the chest, loss of consciousness, difficulty in awakening, face or loss; if the above symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, dizziness, or throat pain, may rarely be observed.
Also, various percentage ratios have been observed with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as dizziness, redness and diarrhoea.
Some cases of disease registered in China were originally merely a feeling of chest depression and heart failure.
In some cases, the disease can progress by developing pneumonia, polyorganic insufficiency, and eventually death occurs.
This is called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but may range from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to occur within 11.5 days of infection, and according to available data, symptoms are not common to all infected people.
The role of such unsymptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but the preliminary data show that they can contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of people infected with a suspected disease is currently unknown and is only studied; the Korean disease control and prevention centres (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations related to the virus during the disease were unsymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began to include unsymptomatic cases in its daily summary from 1 April; out of 166 cases of infection registered on that day, 130 (78%) were rejected as unsymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both wet and mucous membranes can have a high concentration of the virus.
In the case of louder words in the air, there is more chapel than in the case of normal louder.
The study conducted in Singapore showed that the hats can be extended to a distance of up to 4.5 metres (15 ft).
The virus is usually not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transfer of particles of the virus to bioaerosols is possible, and the air test carried out by air collectors in corridors outside the human room showed that there was a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (SDRs), may lead to the spread of respiratory products and, therefore, to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through faeces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible even before symptoms occur, but this risk is low.
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) officials claim that the extent to which the virus is easily spread is not quite clear, but that one patient is usually infected with 2-3 other people; the virus can survive on the surface from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that the virus was able to live within one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on a stainless steel (AISI 304), up to three days and 99 per cent of the copper surface, up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, vary depending on the humidity and temperature.
Milk and milking, when properly used, have a useful effect in the fight against infection: it destroys the virus by deactivating it and is able to remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective against this virus. During the study conducted in Hong Kong, spleen samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient, the highest levels of the virus in the blood were detected on the second day of the test.
The severe severe respiratory coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe severe coronary respiratory syndrome, first discovered in three persons with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhana.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in relatives of the nature of coronary viruses.
While outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic miline that conceals its protective cover. SARS-COV-2 is closely related to the baseline SARS-COV.
Mild is the body most affected by COVID-19, as the virus penetrates into the host cell through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most common in type II mild alveolar cells.
The virus is combined with ACE2 and penetrates into the host cell using a characteristic surface glycoprotein, “chipa” (peplomer).
12 per cent of the infected people hospitalized in Uhana have been diagnosed with severe myocardial infarction, which is more frequent in the form of severe disease.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during disease progression, but severe myocardial infarction can also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities as they participate in the work of the body.
The high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients with COVID-19 ICU and may be evidenced by adverse forecasts. Autopsy of patients who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar injury (ADD) and lymphocyte containing inflammatory infiltrates in mild.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropic to ACE2-expressing respiratory tract, symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation have been observed in patients with severe COPID-19.
In particular, it was found that pathogens of GM-CSF T-cells are correlated with the recruitment of inflammatory monoocytes that distribute IL-6 and the severe pathology of mild patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also detected at the opening.
WHO has also published several test protocols for this disease.
The real-time polymeric chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test is usually carried out on breathable samples obtained from the bone marrow but can also be used as a nose or wet model.
The results are usually prepared for a period of several hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken every two weeks, and their results are of no direct significance.
Chinese scientists have been able to assign coronavirus strains and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can develop tests on their own by means of polymeric chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of this virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibodies tests that could detect infection at the current time, as well as possible infection in the past, were under development but were not yet widely disseminated.
China ' s experience in examining the results of the tests showed that their accuracy was only between 60 and 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food Quality Control Office (FDA) approved the first on-the-spot diagnostic test, which authorized its application at the end of this month.
The bilateral multilateral sub-floor focusses of mating glass type with peripheral, asymmetrical and a posterior distribution are common symptoms identified at the early stage of the disease.
Sudden domination, a symptom of a bluish bridge (deficit displacement of the fence with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
There are few data on microscopic injuries and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological study conducted at the time of discovery:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, emulsion and swelling of the light
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
light pneumonia: fluctuations of light pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltrating and formation of multi-nuclear giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar rash.
DAD is a cause of severe respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxaemia.
Pneumonia: the organization of alveolar discharges and the leguminous interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: Diffusive internal deformity (DVS syndrome); lecoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include home stay, the prevention of human spots, frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with respiratory hygiene rules, and the avoidance of eye, nose or mouth unwashed.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a hat or sneezing, or, in the absence of a hat, covering the mouth and nose of the inner side of the locator zone.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended that a high-quality hand hygiene procedure be conducted.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue masks in public places, in particular in order to limit the transmission of unsymptomatic infections to individuals; social remoteness strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have closed schools and businesses, restricted the movement of citizens and the abolition of major public activities.
Distance recommendations also mean that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
No medicinal products with confirmed efficacy against COVID-19 are available; as the completion of the vaccine is expected not earlier than 2021, the majority of measures against the spread of COVID-19 are associated with a reduction in the peak of the epidemic known as “plate-out”.
The CDC also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or during severe hand pollution, as well as before and after swallowing, coughing or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of a disinfectant containing alcohol (the content of alcohol is at least 60 per cent) but only where soap and water are not available. In areas where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two recipes for local production.
These compounds use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
Water is used to remove bacterial disputes in alcohol and is not an appropriate tool for antiseptic hand-handling.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients have been shown to be supportive of therapy that may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that those suspected of being infected with the virus wear a normal medical mask.
The extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its advantages are still being studied.
In order to strengthen immunity, compliance with the rules of personal hygiene, the healthy form of life and the diet are recommended.
Maintenance methods can be shown to patients with mild symptoms at early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China issued recommendations on care for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, physicians for intensive therapy and pulmonologists summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various agencies in a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment with COVID-19 is available.
For the treatment of symptoms as first-line medicinal products, some medical personnel recommend making a choice for paracetamol (acetamine) compared to ibuprofen.
Caution should be exercised in the conduct of procedures where air-capillary emissions, such as intubation or dry hands, in order to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical facilities.
The CDC recommends that medical personnel dealing with people with COVID-19 be placed in an AIR, an additional measure besides standard contact and air precautions. The CDC issued recommendations on the use of individual protective equipment (SIZ) during the pandemic.
The recommended means of individual protection: a protective coat, a breather or a medical mask, an eye protection device and a medical device. Of the above means, it is preferable to use the breathers rather than medical masks.
The N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has permitted the use of these respirators in accordance with the emergency use permit (U.S.).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but no effective protection against the specific biological agent is guaranteed when the instructions are not used.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends using protective facial displays or, at least, making masks on their own in domestic conditions.
In most cases, the form of the COVID-19 flow is not difficult enough to require the artificial ventilation of the light or its alternatives, but there is a certain percentage of cases where this is required.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory insufficiency associated with COVID-19 is currently being actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by means of an intensive airflow or two-level positive respiratory pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these two ways are as effective for patients in a critical state as the IDA.
Some doctors make a choice in favour of invasive mechanical ventilation of light, if available, because this method significantly limits air particle distribution compared to the air flow of the nose canals. The risk of severe disease for older people (the ones over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries, hospital beds are not available to the population, and health systems are too limited to deal with a sharp increase in the number of coovid-19 infections in a severe form that requires hospitalization.
As a result of one study in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive therapy, 2.3% needed mechanical support for light ventilation and 1.4% had been completed.
In China, approximately 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually rehabilitated.
The task of ensuring the artificial ventilation of the light is complex, as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developing with COVID-19 and oxygenation is becoming more and more problematic.
Inhaled and PVC-supported VHFs are needed to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen in light and to ensure minimal ventilation damage to them, which may result in pneumotorax.
In the early models of high PKV fans, high PKV may not be available.
Potential treatment studies began in January 2020, and several antivirals are currently under clinical trial.
Remedsevir appears to be the most promising.
The development of new medicinal products may take up to 2021, but some of the products tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antivirals may be tested in patients with severe disease.
The WHO recommended volunteers participate in the effectiveness and safety tests of potential treatment methods. FDA provided temporary authorisation for the use of recombinant plasma as experimental treatment in cases where human life is at risk of serious or direct danger.
Its application was not subject to clinical studies to be conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to combat the outbreak of the disease.
In order to enter, users must enter their name and identification number.
The Annex may identify “close contact” with monitoring data and therefore identify the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is identified, the annex not only recommends self-insulation, but also sends notifications to local health authorities. A large data analysis of mobile phones, identification technology, mobile phones and artificial intelligence is used to track the infected and those they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized security authorities to track the data on mobile phones of people suspected of being infected with coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure the quarantine and protection of persons who may enter into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to study and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, the Federal Public Institutions of Germany and the Robert Koha Institute provided aggregated data on the location of hundreds of subscribers.
In Russia, identification technology for quarantine offenders was introduced.
The Regional Health Commissioner of Italy, Julio Gallera, said that hundreds of network operators reported that “40 per cent of people still move to the territory”.
The Government of Germany conducted a 48-hour programme marathon, involving more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersty Kalulyed, also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronary virus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: “Strengthened social isolation, loneliness, concern about health, stress and economic downturn — ideal conditions for harming people’s mental health and well-being”.
The disease can flow easily with minor or absent symptoms that remind other common upper respiratory diseases, such as normal cold.
Patients with mild disease are usually cured within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may need three to six weeks to be treated.
Women who are pregnant may be at a higher risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 based on data on other such viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although no COVID-19 data are available. Some people with COVID-19 may be easily affected and may cause pneumonia as a complication.
People with the most severe illness of COVID-19 may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or polyorganic failure.
The COVID-19 complications include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, and heart, kidneys and liver problems.
Thrombo-forming abnormalities, particularly prothrombin time increases, were reported in 6 per cent of patients entering the COPID-19 hospital, while a failure in wait function was observed in 4 per cent of the group.
About 20-30% of patients with COPID-19 had elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to intensive therapy was seven days.
According to an early-stage study, the mean time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent and among women was 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological studies of post-mortem samples of light are evidence of diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromyxoid exodus in both light.
The pneumocytes have seen viral cytopathetic changes.
An external type of mild reminder was a severe respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8 per cent of the deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were associated with increased troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had health problems; access to medical resources and the social and economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Death estimates vary according to the state due to such regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
A poorly efficient calculation of cases in a light form may lead to an increase in the level of mortality.
However, the fact that death occurs as a result of previous diseases may mean that the current level of death is underestimated.
In smokers, severe COVID-19 symptoms were generally developed 1.4 times more frequently, and such patients needed approximately 2.4 times more intensive treatment or died than non-smokers, and concerns were expressed about the long-term consequences of the disease.
The administration of one of Hong Kong clinics found that some patients recovering from this disease had a slight decrease of 20-30 per cent and that their scans had revealed injuries.
After recovery, this may also lead to the syndrome “After intensive therapy”.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether permanent immunity against patients who were cured from the virus was being developed.
In the case of other coronaviruses, this was considered likely, but also reported cases where the coronavirus tests were still positive after the COVID-19 recovery.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been a prolonged period of disease rather than reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural, has animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely due to its transmission from human to human.
A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls 1 December 2019 the earliest date of the first case of the disease.
Officially issued by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary according to the region and the time of spread of the disease, and they also affect the levels of testing, the quality of health systems using treatment schemes, the time from the onset of disease and the population parameters, such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO attributed emergency aid codes to ICB-10: U07.1 — for deaths from laboratoryly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 — for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ratio of deaths and infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a certain period of time.
According to statistics from the University of Jones Hopkins, as of 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191).
This figure varies according to the region. Some other methods include the definition of the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died from the disease, and the definition of the death rate as a result of the transmitted infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died from the disease.
These statistics do not relate to a specific time period and reflect the indicators of a certain population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced in all infected patients, the presence of such antibodies may indicate how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castilone d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4600, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer living.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread to young people during the celebration, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies according to donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
The impact of pandemics and levels of mortality is different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate was higher than that of men.
The highest risk group is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women is reduced only from 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this difference are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioral.
Gender immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women associated with men's diseases (e.g. hypertension in men younger than in women) may lead to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected were male, and 72 per cent of the deaths of COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government is not conducting gender statistics on COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viruses such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and ORVI have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women, respectively, more likely to get infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
WHO leader, Mr. Tedros Adanam Gebreíssous, explains: “CO” means “corona”, “VI” – “virus”, “D” – “disease” and “19” when the first outbreak was detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid a reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international recommendations to prevent stigmatization. A virus called COVID-19 is called a severe coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
In WHO's public communications, the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus” are additionally used.
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly called coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Uhana, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as “coronavirus” and “Uhank crownvirus”.
In January 2020, according to the 2015 recommendations for geographical use of the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended using the terms “fast respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCOV” as provisional names of the virus and disease.
Official titles “COVID-19” and “SARS-COV-2” were published on 11 February 2020.
Because of restrictions on standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers print medical materials, such as nose fat swabs, as well as parts of IVL devices.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time limit, when one of the local productions was re-profiled and able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
Following the first outbreak of the COVID-19, various theories of conspiracy, disinformation and faecal information on the origin of the virus, its size, prevention, treatment and other aspects have become widely available on the Internet.
It's possible that humans can infect other animals.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, rats and rats.
There is currently no approved virus vaccine or medicinal products for treatment.
Vaccines and medicinal products from COVID-19 are currently being conducted by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the WHO launched the SOLIDAARY Trial (Solidarity Test) programme, which aims to assess the healing effect of the four existing compounds that are most effective to date.
The ready-to-use vaccine is not yet available, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are entering human cells using the ACE2 receptor, and the results of previous studies carried out under SARS-CoV are therefore used in scientific research.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First of all, researchers are trying to establish an entire viral vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection of COVID-19.
The second strategy, the establishment of a subunital vaccine, is aimed at the establishment of a vaccine, which enhances the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying the S-chip protein that helps the virus penetrate into the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of a vaccine based on nucleic acid (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new method for the establishment of a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine in four volunteers was started in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a non-injurious genetic code copied from a virus that causes disease. Antitheloid enhancement has been identified as a potential problem in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
Preparations approved for malaria treatment were evaluated during seven tests, four of which were hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Rehabilitation of antivirals is a major part of Chinese studies; nine Phase III re-dissipation studies were conducted in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 was carried out. To this end, several other existing antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19, including remedicine, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with beta interferon, were also considered.
As of March 2020, there are preliminary data on the effectiveness of remedisvir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remedisvir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already taking place in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine previously used to treat malaria has been considered in China in February 2020 and there are preliminary results.
However, there is a need for an expert assessment of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Uhanian Institute of Virusology recommends the daily dose in one gram, but notes that double the dose is very dangerous and can lead to a fatal outcome.
On 28 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency authorisation for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine by physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The Chinese 7th edition also mentions interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir as a drug against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanid was recommended for a detailed in vivo study demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor requires the administration of a TMPRSS2 trans-embedded protease strip protein.
Studies on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azitromycin have serious limitations that do not allow the medical community to use these treatment methods without further study. Ozeltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinaemia may occur as a delay in the late stages of the severe form of COVID-19.
There are confirmations that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinaemia properties. As a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocilizumab was included in the recommendation for the treatment of coronavirus.
This medicinal product was obtained at 2 stages of the nationally-controlled test in Italy after positive results were obtained in patients with severe disease.
In combination with the analysis of ferritin blood flow to detect cytokines, it is intended to counteract factors that are considered to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, FDA was approved by interleaquin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective thematic studies to treat the release syndrome of steroid refractory cytokines caused by another cause, T-cell CAR.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective tool to treat cytokine-free syndrome.
The transfer of cleaned and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients cured from COPID-19 is currently considered as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
The strategy was tested in the treatment of patients with SARS, but its results were uncertain.
Neutralisation of the virus is an expected effect that allows passive antibody therapy to protect against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may also be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are at the development stage.
There may be an increase in the volume of use of a recombinant blood clot, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of the healed patients and contains antibodies to the virus.
Coronavirus diseases, high-quality syndrome group
Lee Venylan, a doctor at the Uhanya Central Clinic, who later became infected and died from COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
