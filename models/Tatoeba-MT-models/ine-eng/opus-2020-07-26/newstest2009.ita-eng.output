The Prague Stock Exchange at the end of the market has had a negative impact.
After the fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
Transactions in CEZ actions have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
From the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange took over the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this bottom there's the stake of the action on Wall Street.
We also see a response from the market to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which has refused to support the plan for the stabilization of the local financial sector.
Action round in Asia
On Tuesday, the shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic shock, although the indexes, however, during the day, later cancelled a part of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Hang Seng index during the day cancelled almost 4%, but then also some of the losses stabilised to 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the Chinese action movement at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The shares in the Sydney Stock Exchange were lost more than 5%, but at the end of the losses were estimated at 4.3%.
The Thai-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world," observed the head of the Hong Kong Foreign Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, manages its own financial policy, so without relying on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level in the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should return quickly to the dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
On the other hand, there is a risk that other countries too are suffering from the consequences.
Stragues of American action
On Monday, the US Parliament rejected the financial system's support plan, for which 700 billion dollars (almost twelve billion Czech crowns) had to be allocated.
The legislators thus ignored President Bush's appeal to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
The American actions on Monday lived a street and the main indexes of the actions recorded the largest crotch from more than one-twenty.
The Dow Jones index was down by almost 7% and a hook of similar sizes was last observed in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it fell free.
The Congress has given up: the US government can extend 700 billion dollars to the banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
The American legislators have broken the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the American financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (about twelve billion crowns).
But it's not yet said.
The representatives of the Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting it.
The support plan of the financial system will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
Sunday said so to the agency Reuters, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the Barney Frank room.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economies, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor that can awaken financial markets.
Next, however, there will be a return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, the aid of the markets will be achieved.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward."
"We have clarified our different views on the form of presentation of the package for the stabilisation of the market," said Democratic Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
According to the same, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
The legislators met on the night between Saturday and Sunday with the Minister of Finance Henry Paulson, to give final form to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire from financial companies non-cedible mortgage assets, which lead financial companies to serious losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are in line with the final agreement of the plan which will work and which must also be effective on the market."
"It's still necessary to bring the recovery plan forward, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
The Asian Trade Signal
The global financial crisis is strongly affecting the markets for the actions that are being rapidly rolled.
According to the democratic senator of Nevada Harry Reid, this is how the legislators are trying to reach a final agreement to the Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are, in time, the first to influence the Monday market following the Congress' decision.
But for now it is definitely not clear when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote on the law and even if the negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some problems.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount provided for the support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But the Congress can block the rest of the sum in case it will feel that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion dollars and after the final 350.
Bush appreciated progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may vote on this decision, the Congress may exercise its right to vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme has been maintained, that is to say to get the funds to buy the passive mortgage values, whose price is reduced by hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We have developed everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the Sunday law and the Monday Senate," the Republican Senator mentioned.
The progress in the negotiations is also welcomed by US President Bush.
His spokesman Tony Frato said that Bush is satisfied with the positive move on Saturday and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold parachutes
The chairman of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the chief spokesman, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget for reductions, the fragmentation of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called gold parachutes for the leaders of the companies participating in the programme and is setting up a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have taken a great step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan counts on aid to homeowners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new rates of mortgages that it will purchase with the aim of lowering monthly expenditure on the rates for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and for what price the problem assets will be bought
This will determine how losses will be shared between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz website .
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"More importantly, it is that this week the representatives of the Congress have reached an agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is now more important," Marek stressed.
Dwell to the last blood: MP3 readers against cell phones
We'll recommend how to choose
While almost every cell can read MP3 files, no MP3 reader can call.
That makes it clear that it's better to buy just the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons why you are looking for an autonomous reader.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the future owner.
You might find it difficult to buy a expensive high-quality gymnast to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these musical products do not choose as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this reason there is no objective reason either.
But if on your drawers vinyls of hard-rock, jazz or blues are popping up, a giraffe of the kind at least will dream of it.
It also works with portable music, that is compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
There are also categories of prices and quality here.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for an 8 thousand crown reader, as well as a Pink Floyd fan may find it difficult to digest the bowls from twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
To decide is the duration of the batteries.
Some high-quality music readers manage to do much more than simply read music, but what they don't even make cell phones wrong.
There is no other current device as universal as the cell phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone and text messages, you can read music and videos, both register and have a photo machine, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe you can also browse.
And if we consider smartphones and palm trees you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle because no refrigerator can make the grill and no TV can take pictures of anything.
The universality of the cell also brings disadvantages.
More functions you use on the cell phone and first the indicator on the screen will require the battery.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cells can read the music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, musical readers (especially the simplest) are much more effective.
As far as economic cells are concerned, there is no contact that can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, look for safety for another battery, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even worse ones last at least 9 hours with continuous functionality with a charging.
A further problem arises when you download the music in your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of devices has the universal USB port and in addition not all can connect to the computer without a special software.
Surely music can be recorded directly on memory cards, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without adapter for minicards that are not used in cell phones.
Readers, with some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with the music via USB from the computer.
Most of the cells and readers are created by themselves a multimedia library ordered by the names of the interpreters, album name, genre or by the user's classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both things (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, cell phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, you are especially interested in battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly of ease of use.
If the music serves you mainly from the background and if you listen to it every day just briefly on the tram, you will have a phone that reads MP3.
This can now, clearly at any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about which formats the cell phone or reader recognizes.
The MP3 readers all support them, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most widely distributed ones, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods).
The best cells also allow, for example, to buy online music.
Just visit, through the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic to buy a reader-cell phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and is usually limited only to hits at the time of the radio.
The prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (either via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always take the cell phone back.
Anyone wants to listen to some fruit in the bag while the MP3 player stays forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, if you always bring it behind the caps or at least auricate it without wire.
If not, you can use the integrated player that almost every cell, but only a small part of MP3 readers has.
Maybe the biggest advantage of cell readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entry for the common cupware.
The best and technically equipped cells and also with a 3.5 mm hold for the common cupboards cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead, the advantage of the readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) makes it really everyone handle them.
The minimum of the functions, the similarity of handling at a time with the stereo or maybe the giraffe, is obvious.
There is no danger of mistake in starting the mobile internet network and as a result of a giant ticket for data transmission.
Which device to take
Even the cheapest cells (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the card concerned, which falls within 2 000 crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones make it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you also want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are part of the most demanding listeners you prefer to take the specialized mobiles - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of the service so close to the same MP3 reader.
In this area, Sony Ericsson has made more roads, which walkman mobiles have the same user scale as MP3 readers sold separately.
The MP3 readers of the above brands provide you with the same service and price category up to 4,000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in line up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic already this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer almost all the services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, something is missing – a virtual operator that forces traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be missing for a long time.
The fact that the Czech operators belong to the most expensive ones in Europe has already been written many times on Mobil.cz.
Finally, CTU also confirmed it, which noted that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regulation of roaming rates, a paradox situation may arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will cost less than home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high against Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that would really like to start the fight .
It may sound absurd, even where we have three mobile networks and coverage high above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile telephony operators are pleased to see that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, it is also often emphasized by the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, who once expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the traditional operator with its network is no longer likely to have many possibilities. (The rest may now be difficult to find other frequencies).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
It is the entry into the virtual operators market that has led to a significant price reduction, which would then have to be reacted to by traditional operators.
At the same time before the entry of sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile in the market, they sounded similar voices in Britain as we do.
However, it has been shown that there is a place for such operators and that they can really have succeeded.
At the end of the accounts for the examples, we must not go too far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator has managed to conquer over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group to which in the Czech Republic belongs between the other U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete Bersaille group.
In order to be able to operate effectively, there are many less customers than a traditional operator.
They are not behind, i.e. relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually present at low cost, offer calls and SMS at low price, which is often in balance with the offer of the most restricted services
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS that cost at least half compared to its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move, too, to bet on a group-bersaglio not recently.
This operator points to say so specifically about men.
"The real men choose Mobilking operator that likes and can be trusted" says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can say a concept similar to that in Poland.
He questioned the press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepýk: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition from the point of view of the services, it is relatively satisfactory."
In the Czech Republic, no possibility is given to mobile network operators.
But it seems almost certain that if there's ever an operator in the Czech Republic, it won't be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not have many expectations.
The focus of Mobilking will be rather in the other countries of our area," said Jana Studnikková in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz, the spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
In this way it has indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very much in favour of this view.
Instead, they try to do everything because you don't believe in any competitive potential.
For a while he does not hide his interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Nova group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the business client field.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And first it's better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all the Czech mobile network operators.
We have already made progress in the negotiations with some of them," said the spokesman for the Pavel Kaidl Group.
So maybe there'll be better times.
The non-official information shows that the first virtual operator must have it by the end of the year.
For now, however, around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this point, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far, no one with a complex and serious project has addressed us," he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršenj of the press section of Telefónika O2.
The specificities of the Czech market also apply to other operators.
The spokesman for the T-Mobil print Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the declaration O2: "For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build".
And he adds: "On the T-Mobile network, a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
We already had to have a concrete agreement on the table so that it could be viewed as a horizontal one."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on reaching its 3G licence applications.
Adds Miroslav Čepýk : "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators and this in particular in the context of the sharing of expenditure and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the customer point of view, to be the most producer.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
Competent authorities - with complex operators
The attitude of mobile telephony operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profit.
Why, then, facilitate the emergence of such a competitor?
The tires around the U:fon creation testify that when operators have something they can remember from the same side.
Perhaps the heavy pressure pushes against ČTU during the creation period of U:fon towards the T-Mobile company.
This testifies to public information access from ČTU's websites.
But right now U:fon serves as a topic for which you don't accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The environment of the competition of the mobile telephony market has been little stronger than anything with the entry of the fourth mobile operator in the market.
With regard to the typology of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would put on him and above all his high claims."
However, the attitude of mobile telephony operators is quite surprising the complete disinterest of the Czech regulators.
This is not just the attitude of the CTU which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no power to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, in relation to the whole problem has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract of rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator has been realized.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers probably wasn't interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristian Chalupa, the section for external relations ÚOHS, in response to our questionnaire.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators may not be surprising.
On the other hand, the office that must defend the interests of consumers and also take care of the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market is more than a delicate matter.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside where virtual operators commonly operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephony services."
Of course, however, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices does not belong to the interests of ÚOHS.
Truly shocking in all the situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is put on its own.
Just as the same price of petrol for all gasolines is the fruit of the coincidence and competition struggle.
"The section did not find signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points .
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTU, according to which telecommunications is from the point of view of economic competition the only market.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always necessary the agreement of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has- at the end of the accounts logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not accept this argument, for ÚOHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators are acting in such a strange manner.
At the same time, complaints from interested parties (including the mentioned GTS Novera company) show that during negotiations with all operators there are very similar obstacles.
Dischargeing responsibility to ČTÚ in telecommunications is a pretty common trick with which ÚOHS is kept out of the picture.
We've already found this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to promote the expansion of CTU's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the updating of the recently approved telecommunications law, despite the fact that, from this point of view, many experts expected to improve the situation.
This is done by the representatives of ÚOHS to know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it when no one sees
While we do not know how these pseudo-virtual operators operate, some of them even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their price lists of mobile telephony services which are only partially public.
This is usually the case for companies that deal with multi-level marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile telephony services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the people who are settled.
The magic is that the company against the operator is described as a classic business client, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and so on).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar forecast.
"If the cases mentioned, of which we will be interested, were to be dealt with in breach of the contractual conditions, and could disappear in the conclusion of the cooperation with that company," answered the question in question Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of the persons responsible for mobile telephony operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, thousands of customers can be treated.
No operator defends itself at the same time from such an attitude.
In contrast to the real virtual operators, they are not harmed in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepýk advises about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
These also have to accept that the SIM card on their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot have it in full as usual customers of mobile phone operators "
But that's what should be a little weird about the CTU.
In addition, another issue is opened for ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has strong enough rights to mask similar activities and, if he does not want to, you will not have to agree with the explanation of operators who have no idea of all this and whose commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer expensive
As has been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a significant reduction in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - the market too small, at the limit too saturated, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in the developed countries, in these cases, regulators have intervened, not from mobile phone operators, but from their clients.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then came to the creation of the first virtual operator and he agreed to others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators throw themselves from one to the other all as a bulleting potato.
For our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity in these cases makes him more comfortable.
But we don't throw the sponge.
If the backstage information is correct and the virtual operator will really appear to us soon, the Czech mobile phone market will recycle.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only difficult ÚOHS could remain indiscriminate to the refusal (discrimination) of the other parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech inno has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new Czech national versions.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of the recognition of the Czech State presented the new registrations of the national festival "Kde homev můj".
The new registration of the inno was made by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – bedding with male or female voice, chorus pass and instrumental edition.
The canto is under the direction of Katerína Knězzynková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the reviews of the inno are Otakar Jeremáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz site you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful innini.
He already told the radio "Český rzhlas" that he specifically chose to sing the variants on his own, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"At first I tried to have care that both the choir and the choir have the clear word, that the text is understandable, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will be celebrated next year on the 175th anniversary.
The song "Where Home Můj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh dance in the original opera Fidlovočka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
He has bought popularity and people have spontaneously made it his own.
The first piece of the song after the founding of the Cecoslavacchia in 1918 became the natural part of the national inn.
E` remains one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How "new" sounds inno
Wednesday MDD in Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will be released in the metro, tram and bus that will have an electronic wallet in their pocket instead of the paper ticket.
At this moment if you can search for about a hundred thousand people who own their Opencard card.
Passengers can buy that from 30 days and 90 days and annually (which will come from the first January 2009) and at the same time recharge their card in the Infopoints and in the offices of the Transport Company and at the stop of the metro Museum, Můstek, Nadraží Holešovice, Andel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zhrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Cutgliandi can already be purchased from yesterday on the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers took advantage of the service before noon.
Those who start using the Internet service can completely forget the sportsmen in the subway stops where they had to make long files for paper tickets so far.
The cutting is purchased online and on Opencard it is loaded on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have a sports club with a personal format that will help those interested in buying on the internet and will also record on their paper the credit acquired." said the spokesperson of the Martin Opatrny project.
In addition to the libraries you will be able to load the electronic clips on the Opencards in ATM and self-services that are installed at the subway entrances.
How are these banquets?
They are red, they look like the forgetters of the tickets and the passengers have already noticed them at the stop of the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská Metro.
"Now there are five in the whole city but by the end of the year we should be eight," Opatrny concluded.
The cutting will be controlled instead than by the driver from the banquet.
The banking service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard key and after payment of the cut, you will be charged above.
Electronics are worth tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
In the urban lines of trains and buses from 300 to 499, the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added in the integrated transport of Prague, there are the controllers with maps with which they verify the temporal and zone validity," explained the control mode of the Filip tickets from the Ropid organisation, which sets out the time schedules for the collective transport of Prague.
The urban buses have the readers of the cards integrated into the driver’s case.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at the point determined next to the box.
Thus the driver checks the validity of the loads.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded cuttings, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take the urban buses and will not remember, when the cutting is down, they can re-use the self-service banking, where the cuttings are loaded on the paper.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the display of the device.
The Germans of the South wanted a referendum from the United States
The Germans of the South in 1945 asked to include Shumava in the United States.
This is from the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the auspices of the United States.
With this desire, according to what is said, some German groups from the South addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
This is in addition to the letter preserved in a private archive and today deposited in the scientific library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the US President not to allow the return of the "Shumava district" – occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Monaco agreement – to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises for which American units arrive in the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it is written in the letter signed with the words "The people who hold to the fate of Shumava with all the heart."
Because, they say, the accession to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans only hope of brutality, of the lack of respect, of the ‘incomprehensibility,’ of oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate on Shumava now and forever.
"We cannot believe that without the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you will recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, that oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has not contributed for anything, just for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," the letter writes.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the vengeful sect by the " Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States had to doubt the conviction of the Germans in Shumava , it would be sufficient in the district to hold a referendum on the will of his inhabitants to become part of the United States or to live under the United States' standard.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the history of post-war war, some witnesses rightly describe the expectations of the Germans of the South.
Even though the Czech Germans had to at least assume that they would be treated with their movement from the republic, only a few of them admitted a completely similar possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the peoples of the South.
Others thought they'd just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This confirms also the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budějovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in prison in Holštýn, the dozens of other Czech Germans went to find him to teach him the Czech.
"These people thought that once you returned home the Czech would have made him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia during the war, reported that they would have been moved from the Republic on the basis of Benesh's decrees.
Don't think you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history towards road safety.
The emotional media campaign could also be defined, which the Ministry of Transport intends to start on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Rébíček, expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous behaviour to the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on volantines.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol on the wheel.
And also remind him to put on the belt before leaving.
He wants to touch in the consciousness especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not ultimately professional drivers.
What's going to happen in the spot?
Especially people's stories that will affect emotions.
And this also bears witness to the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't think you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the plate.
And in a blood pot, there's the word "payer."
This must symbolize that a person can pay with his life at a time of distraction.
Spots will "fear" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen with dramatic scenes of the victims of accidents.
It is promised to lower the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech streets.
Spots have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Drivers' carats and sticks
"With the drivers, the caroto and stick system works.
The carat for them is for example when they spend time with red and thus save time.
The baton is the danger of the fine or the incident.
The risk to drivers should be remembered," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of the Na Homolce Hospital.
And so they want information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, believe the psychologist.
According to him, the panels that warn the danger drivers are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel has been installed that warns of danger, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and the drivers will no longer pay attention to it," Kořán warns.
Olmert would return almost all the territories occupied in return for peace
The Prime Minister of the Israeli Interim Government, Ehud Olmert, expressed himself for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, namely the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the heights of Golan, in exchange for peace between the Palestinians and the Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published on Monday, daily Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, that is to say that it will be necessary to restore almost all the areas (occupied), if not all," Olmert told the daily.
"We land a certain percentage of these territories, but to the Palestinians we should leave the same percentage (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He has admitted that any refund will also include Jerusalem est .
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want Ruspes or Spaniards to pass on to him, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the accent of the two July attacks in the city, during which some people have been killed and dozens of wounded.
According to the prime minister it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historic places," which are within the Old City. .
"Those who want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he stressed.
The retreat from the heights of Golan
Olmert also spoke for Israel's withdrawal from the heights of Golan, that is, according to him the essential condition to conclude this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the heights of Golan.
They will have to renounce the current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the Hezbollahs (Sciit Movement); they will have to renounce permanent support, which they offer to Hamas terrorism, Al-Qaida (Terrorist Network) (Sciit Movement) and Jihad (Saint War) in Iraq," the first said.
Questions after the incident: Are the stewards illegal on the buses?
The law doesn't recognize them, you can't walk on the long-distance bus
In the context of the tragic incident near the Italian city of Padua of the Student Agency's pullman, the question was raised whether the stewards and passengers could move on the bus during the race.
"If we want to respect the laws strictly and formally, the Steward's activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The incident of last week with which he lost his life a 22-year-old hostess was caused by a truck that cut the road to the pullman.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the safer place of the pullman, although there were still two other seats assigned.
But the bus can cause an accident or slow down suddenly even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
Depends whether the bus is fitted or less on foot according to the traffic book.
If not approved, the passengers must be seated.
Student Agency buses are not on foot, the director of Radim Janchura confirmed it at Aktuáln.cz website.
"We assessed this with the Ministry and at first did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned place," he said his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role."
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from performing the services.
The road traffic law only recognises the vehicle's accompanying term, its rights and duties are not defined," adds the spokesman Hanzelka less clearly.
On the other hand, the Director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorny believes that the law of Curu is enough about this issue.
Depends on whether the bus has approved seats.
Everything here," he says.
It categorizes buses in urban areas where there are pedestrians and the maximum limited speed, interurbans with pedestrians with higher maximum speed and longer handling without pedestrians with the maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in a plane, the expert says.
The expert BESIP on road safety Jaroslav Horín does not find the background problem in the Steward movement on the bus.
"During a quiet course there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to air service.
It's not even safe there when a storm comes and the flight attendant can blow his head off."
"If the bus makes a sudden stop, obviously the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the urban pullman or on the tram.
The carrier company must solve the safety of the stewards by means of an internal regulation," he says and also understands that, from the point of view of law, the problem is not solved.
Janchura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport company offering the steward services..
This uses about two hundred.
The Director does not even consider their business dangerous after the incident.
"As soon as I have the feeling of having to consider the steward's profession as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they leave.
They would also reduce expenditure," he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a section of lines compared to Student Agency, has motivated the absence of stewards on its means as an interest in security.
"We don't have hosts, we've opposed ourselves from the beginning.
Before or after, it will end with a mortal incident," said less than a year before Týden.cz.
It's a huge tragedy.
In the incident of the line for Naples, a young guest in the region of Plzeň died, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency train without using the arrow and blocked the road to the pullman.
The pullman driver tried to avoid it with a sudden manoeuvre, but he hit it with the front right.
Janchura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the Stewarts were occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these positions in the long-term pullman, they are ineligible."
The company has in mind to denounce the truck driver.
The Agency will not await the Court’s judgment to pay the damages to the girl’s family, but a financial compensation is expected from the offender.
The revision of the law?
Not in View
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to specifying the movement of Stewarts on the bus.
"But they have not achieved any concrete results.
They do not consider them so much the pullmans, they deal more than the score system, maximum speed on the ‘road and use of the cell phone during the drive,’ says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of Stewart as a major threat to passenger safety," concludes Portfolio Havelka, who controls the safety of buses is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
Düsseldorf's hopes point to Frankfurt
There are no words missing in the letter from the Director of WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published Monday that could form "the capital market centre of the financial group of savings funds" through the meeting of the Düsseldorf banking institution's unit with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
West LB would launch "a competent block" with lasting profits in such a company.
Moreover, such a union could be a decisive force for further links in the banking sector of the Länder.
Thus it is read when a Board of Directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability of action.
Because the WestLB crash is still under heavy pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Surveillance Authority, I have made a note of time ago to the Regional Government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time limits seeking a future solution.
Of the links between the Deca-Bank, that the same customers of the Savings Fund because of their investment funds already know, and WestLB certainly talks about it for a while, even by Francoforte.
He reported at the end of August the head of the Deca-Bank Franz Waas at the presentation of the bill of the first half of the year that a merger of the house by via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
But the Deka's board of directors, who is brought in half by regional banks and savings banks, has delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with West LB on joint contracts.
This could be market negotiations or parts thereof.
However, the talks have, as they say in the business square, just started.
Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the most in the business square in Frankfurt, is not the first time we talk about it when it comes to consolidating the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed that the Deca-Bank could be founded with the regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate and Helaba for a short period.
There was nothing from this association to three.
Once the projects were published, the Asian regional bank was opposed to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate went to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stockholm.
Yet they have always thought about us for a merger of the Deca-Bank with regional banks.
But at the end of Günther Merl, president of the Helaba Governing Council, expressed himself against design games to meet with his house.
This apart from this seems to be the idea of cognition, which is necessary to bring the different houses of the public sector closer together.
Since the Bavarian Parliament's election has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Württemberg could take place first.
For Helaba, it's not all good news.
If pressure is increased for other mergers, the partners will be missing by hand.
In the South now there would be the junior partner, although so far the financial crisis has been much better than the homes in Monaco and Stockholm.
The Asia-Turingia savings fund association, which participates with 85% of Helaba, has put the chain to the meeting with WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain.
These geo-strategic reasons are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how to combat the various business models of individual homes.
In June Merl noted that the decisive question, with which the business model of the regional banks would be assured, would not have yet been answered by the German savings fund association.
In the end, the division of West LB could also come out, which is not naturally desired by that.
So the letter of the Board of Directors expresses the willingness to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
It will see how the individual parties' reunification with the Deca-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it's the first time while for Luca it's the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a partner, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them at the 5l. bar of the Kaiser brand is standing a barbeque and shows the approximately 200 travelers what the deep tones can produce from the throat.
Elena before Luca a package and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, go this evening at 23,45 four couriers with destination Monaco, Festa della Birra" , arriving at 6.30 p.m.
Three couriers are especially reserved for Italians, while only Brazilians travel in another.
In a parking corner, the South Americans are singing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so noisy, says Marco, that it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long hat with a fake leather case and a couple of glasses with large silver stickers, owns the buses.
For 5 years they've been going to Octoberfest, this year they're 3 tours.
Nightfall, day to day at the party, back at 22:30.
Nighttime would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to the Bavarian rules of authenticity, the case of illness and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave at Brenner's time.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better so, they will still need their strength.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with an Italian mark on the A9 highway before Monaco take a short break.
When, as expected, the Marco group arrives at 6.30 p.m. in the parking area near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others group together, Marco last explains the attack program.
First: put your yellow hat on.
On the left side of it is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When opening the beer tendon doors means running!", quote Mark of the first morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the positions at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, but we're blocking, and not all the yellow jokes sitting on the same benches, split into the right space!"
The mouthpiece costs 8.25 Euros, Marco's urla.
And don't forget to give up.
"Provide to the security service, that we behave well!
Once you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "At 22,30 p.m. we meet again here! Understand?"
She's already going for the party.
On the road is an attack as followed by the yellow berths to the trees, to the road signposts and even to a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as "the final week of the Italians".
Accurate data do not exist, it is 50 thousand, which go to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of the visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Monaco police are strengthened with 7 High Adige agents, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian red cross, which makes a statistics on nationality, where the Italians are the first with 200 medical care in front of the English (about 60 medical care) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the tendency of the Hofbrähaus.
1. Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed by Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the policy has used the word "relative" and has also stressed that the German banking sector is not spared by critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate financier Hypo Real Estate, noted in DAX, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks in order to protect themselves from the turbulence on the markets.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday, support credits would reach up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate must only pay the interest for the requested party.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the end are the losses of the Deffa affiliate.
According to a newspaper article, the state financier has refinanced in the short term – which is no longer possible due to the market challenge.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves were reduced by 95% of the EUR 2.37 million, even the share of the capital itself dropped from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs fell to 0 compared to last year, the benefits of increases in both demand and certain actions, as well as the liquidation of credit statements, fell by more than 70% over Euro 5 million.
Only through higher incomes from the reimbursement of subordinated compensation costs resulting both from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the reimbursement of interest under the sole text of the tax laws and from the management of business affairs for business consortia, the negative profit was sufficiently moderate with around 16%.
The former public financier after being privatized in 1990 had lost in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were evicted in Aareal Bank.
As income in classical state funding was too low, the Depfa has become more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects by private and state investors (PPPs) and has been diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is that dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, 2/3 had been reduced.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of the Deepfa is an important funder of state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market between banks than other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, loans between banks largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hippo Real Estate annually needs some of the Depfa credit portfolio – about 50 billion. – in the short term the means of refinancing.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial requirement was covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected by the influence of the international monetary markets for the most non-functional.
Other sources make it felt, which is the result of the money refinancing up to the end of 2009.
The chairman of the HRE Steering Committee Georg Funke said otherwise that the HRE Group will not need the monetary markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Service (BaFin) are based on the fact that the HRE group's commerciality is still secure.
This is expected for the shareholders and bank creditors.
In view of the dynamics and the impossibility of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
Financing may not be used in full.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After Sunday night the bank as much as it learned it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the souls.
The shareholding price is 75% on 3.30 euros.
The exchange rates are pretty good.
While the previous level of debt is almost irrevocable, the post-credit courses are given.
In particular, the loans of the Württemberg-Hypo affiliate are mainly affected, with a maturity of more than 2009.
Before the HRE loans seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, their value must now, after strengthening the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, which, with the emphasis of the Depfa, has become the crisis, be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Unless the central banks, governments and the less damaged banks are still ready, one can count on a depreciation of annuities by the deadline.
Or it's going to work, what no one's ever expected – that the financial crisis will be over in the next 15 months.
But as for the information covered by the partial state of affairs, it is almost certain that hope has become justifiable.
It will create, in particular, long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision if it divides itself from their commitments.
In the short term, investors may conclude the deduction of losses for future payments of the countervailing duty on value added.
Sylvana and the secrets of Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, the first day of school should be presented at the Tachibana High School, the girls start to laugh: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does it mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new Japan exchange log.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I also had the guts to go to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana High School.
The road had to be found by myself, and I was not lost.
The beginning of the first lesson hour does not seem to have been fixed as well as by us in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive at the piano from 8 a.m. until 8.40 p.m. starts a brief conversation with the teacher, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson started, it was time for me to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who speaks voluntarily in front of people, in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I had not yet had the uniform of school, I had an old mother-in-law, along with a shirt, blue pants and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this I put myself in front of the cathedral and tried to say well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very happy that I had already begun to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class were whining, laughing and making a sign and then I heard the word "Kawaii".
That's what I've known from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lessico of Japanese girls to survive and means "carino, sweet".
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl next to me was giggling, it was an honor for her to sit next to an exchange student.
The rest of the lesson was continued quietly, but when he played the gong, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
They all spoke disorderly and laughed and dried me up with questions – then it is really difficult to understand the Japanese English.
In the break, everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me the lunch basket-- it's different from the boring German breads.
I had cooked with spices, sausages, lemon and algae salad, fruit and a kind of meat and tofu wrap..
I don't even know exactly what I eat in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new taste.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except the ropes put under the hall, brrr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a Good thing done by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope of making the boy know during the recreation.
I read it in my manga comics.
I'm curious if I can find out.
"Why just Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them that I would want to go to school in Japan for a year.
I always said:
'Cause it fascinates me.'
Finally, I've been reading for years with fervor and mangas.
And to better understand the comics and culture that contain, I started to learn a little Japanese before or after.
I was absolutely convinced that I'd come back once.
I'm also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They have a lot of us here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and latest trends -on the other hand: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have never seen in my life."
1. Even rats have feelings
A rat or a rat escapes when they feel the danger.
The neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it be found if, when they behave in the same way, they have our own feelings?
Articles of scientific knowledge have been published on the Internet "Edge" newspaper for some years.
6. SPEEGEL ONLINE in a series presents answers chosen to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to try it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of conscience, without me or anyone else so far being able to prove it, since we can't even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we address other species and ask questions about feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter an impracticable territory, because the reference base does not fight.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that the other animals do. He pretends to be dead, he flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the side frontal cortex is often linked with human consciousness, the associated circuits (this for its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this large area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the basis on which man differs from even the other primates is thus allowed.
Another dramatic particularity should be presented in the way of talking about man: since a large part of life is connected to the language, it is often said to be connected to the conscience.
In this case animals could be excluded.
Although consciousness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of the animal, as it is made, certainly differs much from the circumstances of our conscience.
That is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analysing it through its experience due to the special hardware, their research will cause great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but in addition there is another aspect of consciousness to which it would be easier for science to have access.
Animal awareness processes could be analysed without regard to their content, and this is what happens in the studies on the short memory of primates, particularly in the example of visualisation.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch und Francis Crick follows, it goes first to the neural correlations of the consciousness and to the causal mechanisms: they could both be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of the display.
So, what is it designed for feelings?
I owe them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious activities of the brain.
So what we say as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupys the memory of work.
In view of this, the feelings are closely linked to the regions of cortex, which characterize the primates and, in particular, the human being.
With the talking nature we create subtle shades of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize the situations, to describe them to others.
Considering this, Antonio Damasio believes, for example, that feelings are more primitive activities of the regions of the body of the feelings of the cortex and of the headache, similar to Jack Panksseep, which however focused more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the extended feelings of the species.
At purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it to be indisputable.
Pankseep argues that what for rats and human beings appears to be afraid is likely to be so with the senses in both cases: but how could it happen if rats and human beings prove the same when they behave in a similar way?
Is there a safe escape like he's afraid?
In my view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot yet prove any vital similarity.
And that is, the neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and human beings have similar paleoencephalus, not even a brain.
But is the paleoencephalus responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it for human beings, how would you like it to be shown on rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, there is progress at the neural level, provided that the same procedure on rats and men is abandoned.
As I don't research language and consciousness in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered a myopic, but I prefer to take a step forward rather than constantly breaking against a wall.
I'm a practical emotional on the subject.
UEFA President Platinum: shipment to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the Europeans with Poland," Vasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries"
Both the host countries are in the March table for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
If possible, the number of stages to be set for Europeans will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to work at maximum speed," said Ukrainian Association President Grigory Surkis.
"the UEFA will keep an eye on us"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After many scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN association was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister for Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that PZPN will not be able to operate in accordance with the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP Information Agency.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation for EM 2012 will not suffer."
A number of exhibitors of the first division only in the last season were condemned for manipulation, and at the end of the last moment the beginning of the Law had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid Ribette Angry
He wanted to promote a new film, he talked about the private and now he's got grain with the ex: Hollywood Meg Ryan's star has declared his ex Dennis Quaid an adulterer.
He's squeezing the rhymes.
The war of the Roses is delayed by the former couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors are now arguing with each other a bad fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week expressed himself for the first time on the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and this has been very painful."
The scope of the betrayals she would have come to know only after separation.
The opportunity for the "soul of the soul" was the work with Ryan's press for his new film "The Women" – the story of an adult.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to being publicly declared an adult husband was a clear breakdown: it would be "inaudible", said the fifty-fourth anniversary to "New York Daily News", which "Meg repeats and reworks the story of our relationship for the next time".
It would also be "deplorable" that in Jack , the sedentary son they had together again "are publicly remembered the pain and overcoming, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from separation lives alone, Quaid is remarried and will soon become a father of twins.
And so his judgments close with the arrow: "My life goes on anyway.
I'm lucky to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best."
Call prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008 flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and nights in the hotel have become more convenient - this is the result of a study by the financial provider and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, observed a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places are already priced.
From January to March prices in 41 of the 48 European cities still under review on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
From April to June, however, prices were already down by 3.6% compared to the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year ago.
American Express sees as the reason for this the weak dollar quote, which would lead to a "hot desire to travel American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the drop in hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% hold even the record in Europe
As regards the prices of flights, the trend in the first quarter still points to:
As a result of the Cherokee collapse, Economic Class passengers had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, long-range heavy fuel flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, the prices of the Economy Class air tickets fell on average 12,5 % compared to the previous quarter, however, in the first class and business the price changes were much weaker.
In Germany prices are even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose from 11.9%, in the second quarter they dropped from 23.6%.
As for domestic German flights according to the study, prices have even decreased.
On the one hand, economic growth would be low, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market has been exacerbated.
On the other hand, there would be through the open sky agreement, which liberalises air traffic between Use and Europe, an increased pressure on competition.
The sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of non-remunerated routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared failure – only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a simple goal and methods, Hamburg's SV becomes a chiefist.
In Borussia Luhukay is still unable to find a group of 11 that works.
Here Christopher Klein increases the landing of luck for the national player Marko Marin.
The Player of Gladbach first came late into the game and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was accurately formulated, passed on his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the cabs corridor of the Hamburg sand.
It did not happen until in the catacombs, the game break was over and most were sitting back in their place.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist of HSV for nearly 3 decades, enjoying an even larger estimate of some old players.
And so his monk found even heard in the high spheres.
Cornelius Jol's assistant coach blew up and raised his thumb in sign of approval.
Cornelius is the head coach's brother in Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded the same way: here's the second goal!
No change in location.
"Today it wasn't all good to see," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have become "more relaxed".
For the 1 to zero ones in Hamburg they must thank the blow of the head that went to Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that the many weak players in Gladbach could not have hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
The SV in Hamburg this Monday will be 121 years old.
The spectators already celebrated before, in the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing classification on the video screen, which has legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We are able to put everything in place," said Marcel Jansen.
It has the presentation that the provisional table certificate is more indicative of the unpredictability of the sample than of its HSV dominance.
The team with its new late arrivals – the Brazilian Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric gate as well as Jansen sufficed at the FC Bayern – finds himself slowly, but has not yet been able to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," he relaunchs with Jol force.
After the vote has been taken
Wall Street's about to be scared.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package has temporarily crushed Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of his history.
Later down came back a little later.
Around 20:30 the world's largest stock exchange barometer has quoted/recorded with a good 5% in bulk on 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was firm with a deficit of more than 7% on 1548 points
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, it gave us just 14%, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could have done it.
The actions of the Goldman Sachs bank amounted to just 10 %.
Just a few days before the big investor Warren Buffett took part in the company.
In the context of the rescue plan, the financial funds for the so-called mortgage documents were to be allocated
However, the sum must be paid not in a hit, but in degrees.
If the State were to withdraw it, it had to keep the stock option sheets of the financial companies, which could be redeemed with a proper rate rate , to reduce the State's liability for the State's cash.
The course of action in Europe and in the USA in the vortices of the decline
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and in the USA do not remove the doubts of investors.
The course of the actions of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate falls to peak and lasers the index of the German stock exchange to the bottom
The American Dow Jones index gives us back despite the planned financial market salvation through the State.
Spectacular loss of the course of the Hippo Real Estate and the Commerzbank have drawn the index of the German stock exchange into a deep deficit.
In spite of the rescue action of the federal government and private banks temporarily 3 quarters of their value, the Commercial Bank has given over 20%.
The index of the German stock exchange DAX is clearly broken under the psychologically important 6000 points and is quoted with a deficit of 3.7% of 5,839 points.
The world's stock markets fall to the knees.
New York Wall Street has opened with a clear deficit.
Investors were afraid that the 700 billion-dollar rescue package of the US government could not be enough to bring the financial markets back to growth.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of business or 3.3% of 10.809,25 points.
The House of American Members wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the vote in the Senate could follow the first of October.
The other European stock exchanges could also only be directed: in London the FTSE index has now dropped by 3.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9%.
In Asia, the Nikkei reference index after the initial profits had a 1,26 % discount of 11,743,61 payers.

The dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: the dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativity might not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that freeze fast, it is now up to you to freeze death.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion – the anomaly of Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space probes, with which you get additional salt/spint/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example on Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical expedition as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What surprises scholars for years: the races do not behave at all as we would expect under the gravity law.
Instead, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year repetitated Swing-by's anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter with a curve of space, might not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study believes firmly as before Einstein made a mistake, and tries to explain Swing-by's anomaly through the so-called dark matter that astronomers have seen in the cosmos.
"Responsible of the anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
From the existence of the dark matter, space scholars have only known for about 10 years.
There is obviously a force of attraction coming from her, whose effect on other heavenly bodies is seen.
It itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation of any kind, especially any visible light.
According to scientists, the dark matter is at least one fifth of the total mass of the cosmos.
The tourists captured in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists captured in Egypt would be again free, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros to be rescued.
In a shooting before release 6 kidnappers were killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The rescue negotiations are already under way.
The Germans are always in the sight of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists robbed in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was consistent with the Egyptian TV, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian TV broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released
We are examining their health status," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safe, reported Egyptian TV.
The 19 components of a shipment in the desert are already on the way for Cairo.
The delay of a shooting occurred before the release of the hostages remains unclear: so the kidnappers would have been ready after the instructions of an Egyptian public security officer for the conclusion of the robbery before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed on a ransom," the officer said.
It would be "only tried to take over the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had been killed by fire at 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers claimed a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" referred to a German intermediary, the release of hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women in hostage after the ransom was paid.
Men would have to remain detained until the kidnappers had had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected a position regarding the relationship .
Father's abuses "carried to suicide"
Years of abuse by the father brought a woman to death, he declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, of Stithians, Cornovaglia, was in prison for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly bothered his daughter Stephanie Randle when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a note of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Miss Randle was killed in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Treise harassed her and blessed her before having sexual relations, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Treise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he came back to live in Cornwall.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court found that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that caused her.
In 2006, the Public Minister Ramsey Quaife said to the court that Mrs. Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and who had "spoiled with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
You think you killed yourself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's father, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "The legacies and blessed her."
"I didn't bother you sexually.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Treise: "He is a very strange fetishist, and for his victim he must have been terrifying, especially when he was only seven years old.
"This terrible saga ends with the victim who takes away his life.
Even harder is the fact that if he had not done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to be finished before the court."
I know the effects that Stephanie's father and mother have had on their daughter these years.
"Or else it was clearly likely that she was a promising and happy young man of success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Office's official who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be accused by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man was transferred from the Ministry of Defense when he left on the train for Waterloo two highly classified documents.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is the least sensitive of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal attempt.
The BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They thought this was treated internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is to be accused under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service has recommended that the officer be accused by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The missing documents contained assessments on al-Qaaeda and the security capabilities of Iraq.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and brought to a hidden place.
Construction companies face the B&B account
English construction companies could face an account of more than £80 billion after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has given 14 billion sterlings to protect the 2.6 million savings deposits of Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take the savings, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is "angrily" that companies and their members have to pay.
The 14 billion sterling loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid each year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits, but the interest that will mature in the meantime will be owed each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is annoying that those institutions that have acted cautiously... are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to 450 million sterlings in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million sterlings to pay for the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the construction company association, told the BBC that he believed it was unfair.
"It is annoying that those institutions which have acted cautiously in the market in the resumption of houses are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions which have been much less prudent."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We need to examine all aspects in the next few weeks to see which options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a significant account," Mr Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
The milk comes with 5 pennies per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in the wholesale prices of her milk for an extra five pennies per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retail sellers must decide whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the increase in February, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Rejects bail to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladesh court rejected a request for security from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant 50 million takas ($729,700) to a business man when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of the many corruption charges against you.
The long-standing political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh by Sheikh Hasina is scheduled for the next few weeks, but his party, Awami League, has asked that the country's temporary government supported by the military the first days of total freedom.
The correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical treatment on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of her release, if she can remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he'll call the Supreme Court against the Order of the High Court.
"The High Court has rejected the request for security for Sheikh Hasina by saying that she cannot have the security since she is already abroad on the word for medical care," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will present or appeal against the Order of the High Court."
His lawyers explained that he needed security to return to the country from abroad to prepare the December elections.
The return to Sheikh Hasina's house is expected after October 17th, a senior leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the government attached to the military took power, but she was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical care.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear for Afghan campaign anti-polo
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing the recent campaign of immunization due to Taliban-related violence, says the United Nations.
The United Nations has launched a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it's said he can't reach the children in Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A United Nations spokesman said that this happens despite the promises of Taliban who would not attack or impede thousands of staff carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the rival ITV television station.
BSkyB was told by the competition court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed for an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's participation in ITV raises doubts about ITV's independence, making the Competition Commission launch an investigation.
The chief of the Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stack was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special Minister of Public Affairs to examine the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation occurred when a report on the case was made by the Inspector General of the Department of Critic Justice on the actions of the Administrative Officers.
The report was critical to the White House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by the fear that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
The Public Special Minister Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in an attempt to hinder justice.
"Series of allegations of potentially criminal behaviour have not been fully investigated or exhausted," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine American prosecutors were removed from their positions from the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department said that the lawyers had been fired for failing performance.
But later it turned out that the dismissed lawyers had not been assessed more late than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal was motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors were involved in the judicial action against the Republican members of the High-Profile Congress, while others refused to investigate the charge of fraud against the harm of democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute in court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they can't be fired for political reasons.
Then the head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was in the storm for the dismissals, and finally reinstated his position.
A number of other officials from the Justice Department were fired.
(The Commissioner-General's report was very critical in relation to Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in the dismissals, which he had devoted to his role as leader and had been extraordinarily distracted during the process.
Other officials, including Bush Karl Rove's former assistant assistant, were criticized for not working with the investigations.
The Epica dei Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for its inno Bat Out Of Hell epic.
The singer, who will return his special gold prize at the ceremony next week in London, said to be "honored" to gain recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit track of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for the awards this year, being in the list of appointments in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that pass things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is no doubt one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, demanded a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrument section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was performed as a single in UK in 1979 and reached its fifteenth place.
But Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell's album remained almost nine years in class and became able to sell more than 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf - true name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heart beat in 2003 after he broke up on stage.
In 2007, acute larynx forced him to cancel the concerts.
It came out later that he had a cyst on a vocal string.
Dark streets of the city, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, roads and other crossings, some famous, others just used.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and residents have long found it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The small street is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without doing the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty wolf than an active road traffic.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal Atlantis.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner transition for shops and boutiques that should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include close friends who say that they were hit by the steep road simply because it was one of the last remains of the noble neighborhood of the past.
But the city's preservation and development department, which has road control, has no interest in having it.
During a meeting of the Committee on the Use of the Land of the Municipal Committee of the District some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay drew up a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers the road to stay in the city's hands, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, director of the Community Board 3 District.
"There is very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There could be proposals to establish and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that he wanted to reopen the small street and install seats, including some to be used for a coffee where the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this abandoned village and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Preservation Accommodations, said that in fact it was the city's desire to sell the road and made it clear that the agency's purpose was to develop property rather than administer it.
Compared to its most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical print.
Some believe that he took the name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was split between his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The door on the back of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road is perhaps best known as the picture set for the album cover of the Ramones "Rocket to Russia."
"The land was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"He was full of impondition, brandies of clothes and parts of boots, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write "genrification" of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, leading that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a city fragment almost nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A somewhat nostalgic look at the city in the way of extinction"), published part of a talk of the history of the city that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a wrong visa without exit, also dark of day and limited doors of storage in rusty iron and windows with the Sarachinese, with old newspapers of weeks that flow along the bottoms."
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran through the back of the road near a door leading inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic store of clothes.
There were graffiti on the walls and an empty 22 ounce bottle of beer near a group of abandoned newspapers.
A few passersbys said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but they suggest they'd need to be a little adorable.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said that he also thought that some people underestimated the attraction of the road in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty and disgusting places."
Bilingual debate: immersion in English
At this point of the Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member of California's studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
To really attract Spanish voters is a complicated affair.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "African and Latin students have significantly less probability of diplomats than white students," which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transit bilingual education" for English students.
However, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in satisfying learning differences.
For example, take Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the eastern county of Los Angeles.
School students are for the Spanish and low-income majority.
Over a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But among the fourth students, a surprising 100 percent of the students did the higher level test in the 2008 math exam.
An equally surprising 93% of fourth-class students did the expert level test on English-language art.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient than that preferred by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes the review and exercise, constant assessment of the skills and an attitude of the type "no excuses".
Moreover, and it is here that Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of the Sixth Street, of the school's obstructive approach to English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "We had a fantastic success with a student just coming from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months after you were unable to find out what it was".
"It works," he remarked, "for us it works."
Would Obama take a school model like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Spanish majority schools and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its continued support for bilingual education prevent Mr Obama from predicting the answer.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the subject ban when he said that people should stop worrying about "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps of achievement, he should consider carefully the educational models that work rather than despise them or banish them.
Oil shrugs suddenly and renews economic fear
Oil prices have fallen sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the US rescue plan for the financial markets may not be able to solve the economy.
The future of the grain fell from 7 per cent to $99.80 at the market market market in New York in the morning.
Prices have lost more than $20 at the bar from last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the raw materials markets have been driven away by the financial agitation of Wall Street, and by a couple of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 in June, prices were reduced to almost $90 at the beginning of this month, before rising again, on the background of a tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety has influenced investors again Monday even after congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement at the weekend about the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was obscured by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from past.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will purchase the bank operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
The analysts at Barclays Capital said that the break-up negotiations of the weekend had led to a rescue agreement " seemed to have failed to revitalize the feeling of the market.
As the economic situation worsened, we expect the demand for raw materials, including oil, to calm down.
"The perspective for global equity, interest rates and exchange rates markets has become uncertain," the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the contamination.
From the perspective of raw materials our most pressing concern is to the extent that the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for the next year, while household oil consumption due to slowdown of economic growth, reducing the forecast price of oil and gas by about 20 per cent for 2009.
The operation in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, the defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he watched it take place on the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a game without points into a climb.
"More to see something like this," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had levelled the grey of the menacing clouds over them with a tricky game.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranus Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon in which their growing symptoms made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for another two touchdowns in the room, including one when one cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I didn't leave my path," said Favre of all the steps to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Cole were playing games, the defense severely hit the quarterback of Cardinals Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a vague launch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another passage and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner fan.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took advantage of that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had taken over the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely has been a 20-yard goal, for an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets have ever signed in a room.
When asked to describe his madness, the coach of the Jets Eric Mangini said, "The second fourth or the third fourth?"
When both were told - the Jets gave 21 points without answer in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter much more than the third."
There were a lot of points in a little time slot."
Gebrselassie resting above his record of the world
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown again because many consider him the best marathon ever, breaking his same record of the world at the Berlin marathon Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2 mile race under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory on the race favourably plane at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sends in francs for 27 seconds his previous score of 2:03:26, run last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie sets up the 26th record of a world career such as a world championship or a record of the world at every distance from the mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped Beijing's Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps in too alarming, in retrospect - that air pollution would have worsened its asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees from departure, 55 degrees from arrival - Gebrselassie won on Sunday with an average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half of the founders like Gebrselasia and Paul Tergat del Kenya went a long distance, the marathon record fell more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa del Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago she had her eyebrows at the pulpits and missed a week of training.
Of course, the rest left her fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told the reporters.
"All was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had some doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
It was a bit critical - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for having orchestrated its races excessively, usually avoiding many of the best marathon stars in the world, counting on the apripist as if it were a middle-ground race, and putting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely decrease the size of Gebrselasia's skills as a marathon.
With the step crammed by four Kenyans Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite corridors, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held a competition with Gebrselassie after the apripistas had disappeared.
A little over three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie made a final push to separate from Kwambai, which ended second at 2:05:36, improving her best personal time for almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's competition, Irina Mikitenko, native to Kazakhstan, now a German city, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
You lost the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad incident, but she is cured to win Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she has run.
She ran a race doing her calculations well, leaving a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan corridors to go with a big distance, taking her back after about 18 miles and a half.
Ascale Tafa Magarsa dell'Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop del Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the extensive theme park on the Orlando suburbs, a few miles from the splendor, from the noise, from the enormous, lies the quiet city where pride and the complications of the African-American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first black city incorporated into the country and the home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, abundance of guava, two schools and no prisons."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city that has described - and that stops tourists including it in the Florida tourist guide produced by the Depression era Federal Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
It is so independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little of us, doesn't know what's going on."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential appointment, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening talk on the race, many here remain discriminating from the look of the outsider.
"We are very careful about how our history is told," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a resident of the entire life and member of the oldest church in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradise of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of taking power of black and a community of almost 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary centre, but also an example of the shadow of the oaks of the rural culture of the South Blacks - sometimes despised, sometimes awarded - born by American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both fair and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really began with Zora, who everybody here is called Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere books, rich in dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Wee Watching God" (1937).
Five sections of Florida's guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten centre of Florida within a scenario of black history and human drama
Low as a purse both in life and in literature, Hurston brought the readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then turned into more private areas.
"Out of the street to the left," he wrote, "it's the modern public school, brown with the finishes in white, with its well-maintained gardens and courtyards, to which Howard Miller always looked, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever fits to the passage rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This wasn't really Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston immortalized her by quoting men who sing Grossolan songs about their beauty.
Add: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned from his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, remembers that when Hurston was swimming in the city, he usually arrived without notice in a triumph Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that today also enjoys dignified clothing.
Many residents were fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while others were being harassed.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, in addition, dondolandes on his chair on the courtyard on the back overlooking Lake Sabalia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "he never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although once she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 20s, she was buried in a dead tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, and no great conference.
"I don't think they understand their contribution to the world or their abandonment to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography by Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-course highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-way route.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed the Interstate 4 across the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Enforced integration, in addition to other things, had brought an end to its idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle on racial mix brought hatred on the community's home door.
"During that period, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things to the people sitting on one side," said Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who was killed that time.
They got a coconut from a car."
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made the Supreme Court a request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "a insult rather than an honor for my race".
The residents now say that the disengagement of schools, despite being positive in some respects, unravels the cohesion of Eatonville and reiterates the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - hug your teacher in the morning, hug your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher... - I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame the prejudices, as he did, with joyful security of himself and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I can't really understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker began a long journey to the dead tomb of Hurston and began to fight for the resurrection of his reputation.
Five years later, a famous biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway hit the bookstore cabinets, reintroduceing it into the American cannon.
The project of the highway arrived just as his most famous daughter had repatriated the lights of the reef.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston saw her as a lifesaver.
The community began to design a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January, many come back for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state withdrew from its road project.
"The five races of the resurrected highway have brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd put it in a simpler way: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project helped change the image the city has of itself.
Those outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the public historical register in 1998.
A new bookstore on a single floor (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a Kennedy Boulevard repatriated and abbreviated.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s of the 1800s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to look for the story of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A requested permission in advance is required for most of the interview, to some things - like the walls on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who shows black men in the fields - do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weak for the bright red, still fear that their island community will be broken.
However, as soon as the Hurston Festival has expanded, a high level of citizen pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, no better, nor worse and fair, creative, great worker, shock and confusion like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is a genuine civil affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And even those younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, twins 11 years old from Winter Park, seem to have learned how to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they have just entered here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,' said Alondra Kenon after putting in a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's really a nice city."
Here in New York, we all talk fluidly about finance
On the surface, nothing's changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newspapers and huge TV screens of Times Square, they would not be able to stand in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, nesting over their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York live the worst "brown day in the office" every day from the turn of 1929.
The factories spray metal carts for the way through the marches, carrying muffin vases for breakfast meetings.
Latin-Americans drag their feet between condoms carrying, such as human mules, 50 and stretched shirts to a stick on their backs.
The employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel to the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new book of savings Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the façade so that it would coincide with the afternoon break to my JP Morgan Chase's subsidiary, a line of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's gym, to withdraw money or deposit, but in front of the customer service gym, where old customers order check-in books, tourists ask for directions for the big Macy store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would have learned from Starr, my "trust banker," were in line for my own reason.
On the contrary, however, they have already taken the savings from smaller banks from the places where the pendulums are made, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken the money from the so-called triffs (a little like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose subsidiaries operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family.
In the past years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
The last days the Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was subject to controlled administration, and, while the New Yorkers went home for the weekend one afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer who saved it.
The employees and tradesmen who were in front of me, imprudent for another crash, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe port, the bank that is asking for more bail on Wall Street.
Common New York in the last few weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman to my Chinese trusted supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank went bankrupt, and her emulated director general Dick Full in all familiarity, as if lying about a bad colleague.
And Lyn, the portinia in uniform, almost fifty-years of my condominium, has changed the subject compared to our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expense.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not running any risk."
Muslim Tombe profanate as Austria turns to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, left of the right wing of the Party of Freedom and Filip Dewinter of the right Belgian party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization "City against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They bring signals like those street representatives of the mosque with a red line passing in the middle.
The police have blamed the right extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the political parties of the right extreme have won a lot to national general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun cemetery near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The culprits have traced with the spray Jewish symbols such as David's Star above some graves, but the detectives believe it could have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations guided by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the profanation, which occurred at the end of Ramadan, months of religious relevance to Muslims.
In the meantime, Austria embarked on a journey of spiritual research following its right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right parties that took almost 30 percent of the votes, the party of Austrian freedom and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, made a campaign with veto anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Party of Freedom who won more than 18 percent of the votes, made a campaign against candles and burkas and also expressed his opposition to the foods that are perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European fraternity" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and mines, leading to political symbols of a continuous Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Investigations and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have established the extreme right as the nation's strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was brought to the fore by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
In Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of sexual abuse on children, was forbidden to travel to France and Spain from the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he had informed the authorities who were controlling him to want to go to Spain through France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to the Kent police last Thursday after giving the magistrates the proof of previous arrests of Glitter for sexual abuse on minors.
Glitter, true name Paul Gadi, was not present at Ashford's award in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford's price, Kent's police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling abroad in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64 years old, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the registration of convicted persons for sexual offences.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give a seven-day notice to the police on his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may result in a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent's police said they don't want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter's movements in the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have adequate complete systems to manage every potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent's residents is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted persons for sexual crimes registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two boys aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he was sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have made it pass through the passport and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
At the end, he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to include him in the register of sexual offenders.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having images of abuses on children.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacques Smith, the Secretary of the Interior, felt assured and happy that Glitter had been stopped by traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the teacher away from the scene to draw the character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No spots, no wheels, no clothes from the start.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the appearance relaxed of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, at those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they must not go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flemenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some of the songs, dancers and guitarists on stage with the less well-known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original flamenco iconography, taking it from various visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day ever larger," explains the artist and explains that in "Flemenco-People" it could also be common people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, interpreters or performers on the scene.
These "on the street" portraits are "artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the public.
To catch the personality of these big ones you don't have to pull them back into the stage,
because their personality and character are inner.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With the passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began a long journey in 1997 aimed at bringing back singers, guitarists or dancers using a camera with a blade.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, remember the classic photography.
The application of various stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects the design of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, capable of winning the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, were and have been the constant of this work, at the El Fotomata gallery in these days.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, appear in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a kind of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exposed during the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportARTProject" portraits.
Although in "Flemenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "We want to draw people, know them and be able to penetrate them for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think the portrait is the most difficult kind of picture.
You meet or compare with people, characters you don't even know at times or give you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flemenco-people", is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at the number 20 via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he's writing is a "hazard"
It is surrounded by places he still does not know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is at the scene with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Since he was always favorited for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is currently dealing with "is an accident" and that "all indicates that I shouldn't write it."
"If I had a good sense, I wouldn't write it, but I'll do it as well and hope to finish it as soon as I can," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw pass through the city of Acquidodto a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and Los Perros" was, as prognostically, the figure of spicco at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award to be the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" book, filled the positions of the theater Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of a public to whom the time was flying when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humorism, revocated as born in him the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "play to read" and "live beyond what I was living"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to supplement the "miss of inspiration", with an intense documentation, writing and continuous recovery work; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "the images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an efficient experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, "there are effects" and that it "makes the most anticonformist people." That's why he invited the writers to "do not give up on the frivolity" and to "take responsibility" of their vocation.
Time hinders the Festival of Pozoblanco, preventing it from running
The celebration of the races that should have suggested the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the tours selected for the races had verified that the conditions of the plaza soil were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
Weathers broke against this festival, preventing two days from celebrating on three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second bull race.
The cartels included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who would have faced a bull from Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was scheduled to take place only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque to triumph, cutting three ears and coming out into triumph, after having tore with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante finished his two races by picking up health and an ear, granted more by the public than by the race itself.
The worst among them was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutches, the figurines of most of the public were earned.
A truck with two thousand kilos of hashish crosses the stop point in Alava
Five less than ten in the morning.
Agents are intimate to the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping, they give themselves to the escape.
Agents have hired the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping, they ran away.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
After they have been pursued, the agents are able to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years old, identified as A. A. J., as reported in the Communication of the Department of Internal Affairs of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual is charged with drug trafficking and counterfeiting of public documents.
The incident occurred when some officials on the Alava road were carrying out a control of the transport on the N-1, where it was through the municipality of Arminón.
They insisted on stopping a van for the inspection when the driver, crossing the orders, speeded up and crossed the stop.
Agents went to the chase until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the edge of the road and its two occupants ran into a forested area.
Ertzaintza's agents were therefore able to arrest one of the fugitives and kidnap the 2.178 kilograms of hashish they carried and took note of once inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish panels, which were in the back of the vehicle, were subsequently placed under police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
Furthermore, since the officials found that the matrix was "doubled" because it did not match the one reported in the van documentation, the crime of falsification of public documents was also charged to the arrest.
Ertzaintza is continuing investigations to arrest the second suspect, who has managed to escape as mentioned above, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old A.A. J. was taken to the police station to conduct the appropriate procedures and to be available to the court in the next few hours.
Arrests the actress Heather Locklear for guidance under the effect of medications
The actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw him perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the car from the parking lot in Montecito, as revealed in the People magazine by a spokesman for the California street.
The witness specified that around 4:30 p.m. Locklear "was pulling the accelerator deep, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the car with push forwards and backwards. Making a rear-view, he passed several times before his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first sight apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped in a nearby street and had left the vehicle.
It was this person who was alerting emergency services, because "she was concerned about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"He seemed confused," and that's why the agents led him to a specialist drug and alcohol center to test him.
According to a spokesperson of the police, the actress proved to be cooperative and the hypothesis of excess alcohol was removed from the beginning, even though "as observed by the officers at first, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
The Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of driving under the effect of some non-best specified substance and was imprisoned in the local prison around 19:00, to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was re-established by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being recovered after an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU federation to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The UI coordinator general and member of the Izquierda Unida Party, Gaspar Llamazares, today confirmed that he will be waiting for the regional federation of training to take a decision on the case of the former advisor to the Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the charge of customerism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said about the resolution that the party will have to adopt in relation to what has been a civil counsellor to this day.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have done. "The UI has always wanted us to have this type of investigation as transparent as possible."
In the same way, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public charges."
"Sangre de Mayo", Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Episdios Nacionales of Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci is offering in Sangre de Mayo the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost EUR 15 million in budget.
With this film, the director tried "to illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría head of a large cast of interpreters.
Blood de mayo, for more than two and a half hours, starts this Friday in the cinema halls, to become a television ministry in the future more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this spin "a dream of his childhood", and he believes that he should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Madrid Community had commissioned him three years before turning a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2rd. The director had agreed that the story based on the novel Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million budgets allocated by the Community of Madrid for Garci have been a "unique opportunity" to re-create the appropriate scenarios and customs to draw back a "stupid Spain which failed to choose the leader for which to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence has led to a huge delay in development under the Kingdom of Ferdinand VII" has noted Garci.
However, the director regrets that he did not receive funding equal to that of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than double than Sangre de Mayo, so it was not possible to turn some of the scenes that he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the Rever's director at the beginning, influenced what is his usual work practice, the stage with the actors, with which he often uses to try to turn together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "demiliating," considering that "part of the director's work is based on going to the theater and cinema to know what's happening in the sector in which he works."
Many of the interpreters, some of whom are part of the Sangre de Mayo cast, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood - its Blood de Mayo, Seven tables de billar francés and, last selected Los girasoles cegos - do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "that should instead be known."
Garci doesn't expect prizes from this movie.
"At first you think you work for posters, then you realize that you work only for prosperity, and at some point you agree to just turn a movie more," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon discovers the civil essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Civilian Ballerina makes tribute to another ballerina as well as to Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, a Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and mother Andalusa (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), born in the Triana district, and at the age of three he moved with the family to London.
It was a free dance ballerina and a specialist in Oriental dances.
He led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, of Isadora Duncan's caliber, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I'd like to work with Pepa Gamboa and she's offering me this character.
He maintains the ballerina: "We do not intend to tell his whole life, but to collect the spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested to me some basic elements of the flamenco.
So, "the dance of the bat" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tanghi.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing also comes into this aesthetic," he explains.
The stage includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will again sing Isabel in one of her shows, as she does in the "Open Door"; and that of Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what she was a student.
"Matilde interprets Adult Tortola, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored about this."
The album also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi di Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been all round, and who have always had many spasms."
The work is in some ways also present the life of this woman in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since she normally lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her, because I think that she is one of the women who have had a huge influence over a period of history and now no one remembers her and so much less considers her work as something valuable" the Bayon supports.
The show will begin today, at 20.30 a.m. at the Lope de Vega theatre.
With the publication of the "Dario de un un un reen remarried" also closes the Triennio
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Dario de un Poeta Recincasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Advisor to the Culture of the Andalusian Joint to celebrate the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
Thus, the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Choco de Light", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Advisor to the Culture of the Joint of Andalusia has acquired a total of eighty copies of the "Dario de un Poeta Reincasado", under the care of Peter Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the highest-value Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is of actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de Malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of America, in front of the disturbing idea that Newman left.
Yet it cost him a lot to deliver him an Oscar.
And since 2007, he's been retired.
And it was also known that he was very ill.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what a test goes beyond any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better thanks to its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland died at a particularly dark moment, for the fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem from the American people to the earth, to the desperate search for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and are well left to admire, it does not need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, it was the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and lost causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the first death of overdose to the creation of the domestic and biological food brand.
All gifts to a country where it's hard to go beyond a suicide food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without taking care of either nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that a man didn't die, was over a time.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, director of Oscar's award, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the apex of his career.
The bad boy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, has been gambling to define Paul Newman's greatest inspiration.
"He left an example of a very high level for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today try to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high consideration the need for justice and having a serious and distant private life to the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try and Paul Newman is a good example for these.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, who remained faithful even though he certainly did not lack the opportunity to be there.
"Why am I going to eat hamburgers today, if I have a steak at home?" she used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that his children on earth are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Among all the great roles he played, none of them was as proud as that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a rebellious and passionate philanthropy," they said.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will take place in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the "perfect course", but in my opinion it was the worst thing I've ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, which if it were then taken into account in the evaluation and I had to examine it, would be totally negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The jokes began with the withdrawal of the dorsal, which assumed it was going first.
It didn't seem like a bad idea, but if you're forced to go, that's to take it all away (including the chip to avoid the codes during the race).
Not at all.
You had to go only to take the dorsal (first nonsense, go only for this) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they had only 'S' meshes (second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they have decided to buy only small bags made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are inescapable compared to the day of the race.
Besides having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the waiting line was 15 minutes and, more importantly, you had to deposit the bag.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as it was predictable, the race started that we had not even deposited the bag, even though, once it was successful in the company, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the expectation of more than 40 minutes, to which attempts of popular rebellion were added and attacked at the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even result in the correct classification due to the chip that, I suppose, did not record the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this will certainly not enter my mind.
So I think we'll keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search recipient (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented in advance a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case described by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company campus) by assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of facial recognition, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who are - including recalling their position in the company - and listening and understanding the key words in a conversation with them.
It can also group those present in conversation groups.
In the video, for example, the receptionist detects a third person, but realizes that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she's there to visit someone and says she'll be at her disposal shortly.
Everything without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
The company now has better focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with essential and less commercial vacuuming functions, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for "the least".
All a discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is acceptable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is becoming more and more important, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same thing for your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think about the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People always pay less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You only take the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome – and we spend more time daily browsing in a network than in a remote window environment.
What are half the operating system applications used for?
It's less than that.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to make them a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, in fact, and here I bring a small example.
I took the photo inserted in this post in one of the recreation sites for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the drinking machine a folder urges them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to do online research.
Last week, the rest, was confirmed the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be placed on the market in the early months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, unless it is even in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The cell phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is painful.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the Côte d'Ivoire, Leonardo di Capri, in 'Diamante de blood' by Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino's 'Il Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola, in addition to being part of the typical uniform of the gay muscle parish.
And if we try to list the appearances of the stars, we can reverse the image of the force with the pointed buffs that lift the weights in the ambulatory circle.
It is essentially the typical man-made shirt, with inside cotton, attached and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, even though the Belgian Fabulux Marcel lies above all.
The "Marcel" excels above others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive stamp and for the small Belgian flag (unrecognizable), which the most emblematic models of the shirt carry as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels above others for the high quality cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive stamp and for the small Belgian flag (unrecognizable), which the most emblematic models carry as detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian company does not only concern the famous "tank".
It also includes flakes for the college, back boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, sailor shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a sin to use them as intimate whitewashers.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, I don't care about the candidate"
The great similarity with the sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, sisters Cruz took their new activities in the fashion field very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who bear their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that Mango has made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important prizes that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
He's hot and shy, he wins you fast.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for the autumn-winter season in Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the opera in honour of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what items does your new collection for Mango go into this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the movie of the '60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then they love to lose me in the city and observe how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I often do so.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe that, even if at the end of the day, everything is inconclusive and there are many elements in common.
To me, as a child, they liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to enjoy my aunt's closets and to see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the game park.
Then, once a ballerina, I've always paid a lot of attention to the dress.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to class and to the wise, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actresses, when you're delivered the watch is the time when you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with great respect for the stylists and the professions.
Not long ago, you've been 30 years old, you've been in crisis?
But not.
Never heard better, I like the 30-year-old idea.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to enjoy life by making less mistakes.
My biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was little, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because she's asking me for my own body and I also want to be a young mom, I don't want to lose it.
As for the candidate, I don't care too much.
What I will do will be to give my son much happiness and to educate him with great love.
As for the cinema, you're waiting for some films to go around in the different rooms last year.
That's right, and I want them to scan a lot.
Being a woman coming from the theater, I am very impatient and anxious, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it can't always be that way.
I want you to eat "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the tomb of Christ."
Let's see if you'll like it.
A few days ago, you debuted on the pass with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was in a tunnel like a model.
Just Naomi Campbell, who has known me for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity show for her organization "Done for a better world" and the clothes we have shown – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango - have been auctioned to collect funds for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this nice side of Naomi.
They say so many things about her, that I know her for a long time I can confirm that I am not so true.
Moreover, I find myself with this good part in which she is involved.
He asked me to show up for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pin, I would have done it the same way.
If it's to help third-world women, you can't go back.
Recurrent drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcohol"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that drivers with three administrative sanctions for excessive blood alcohol, install in their car the system that prevents the driving of the vehicle in a state of vomiting or if it does not fall into the device.
The measure has been announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the General Public Prosecutor, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The aim of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this will have to be a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the Directorate-General for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of the drivers reported more than once for driving a pregnant woman then drive the car back.
The alcohol would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the blown air and prevents you from driving the car if the driver does not blow, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than that allowed.
The cost is more than EUR 1000 and would be charged to the defendant.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices would reduce up to 65% of the offences committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to stop these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And in order to facilitate their development, since legal reform can be carried out on a regular basis, and, without a doubt, the necessary reform for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, even though it has already been experimentally introduced into some industrial and public vehicles.
It is tomorrow that the Congress of Members will vote on a PSOE initiative which proposes to install this system on school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British timing, at 17.40 a.m., the second programme, the Spanish aircraft in which the Asturias principles were travelling landed in the presidential hangar at the airport of Benito Juárez di Città del Mexico.
The sun was rising, but the rays still forced the hand to be used as a visionary to see the real couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, along the road, if he knew that the Spanish principles were going to visit the city to formalise an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you won't be able to go to the airport to load people at that moment... you're from here or...
No, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the Asturias principles are and the importance of the trip.
There are many who wait in the hangar of the airport on the red carpet and the military cordon composed of 27 Marine soldiers offering the honour.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, calls to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they reported that in Mexico City she was threatening the wrong time.
They give the photos a smile and a brief pause before going to the room where the official comitival awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a spiritual reporter of Mexican television awaits them.
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world most suitable to present a fashion prize, which is not Paris and there is probably no more delicious and bont vitan of Valentino.
Mango just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talent in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, watched his drawings in the window of Mango at the number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept out of emotion.
On the other hand, it is the company's second largest store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first one is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the Valentino stylist who presided over the jury of the competition, started with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the close proximity of Chagal's most delicious tele, the presidential table of gala prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and making a need for virtue, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a household dress and some ELAH supplements to take away the fiate and arm of his son Luis - a boy almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the president of the wedding dinner.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the house honors and the knight who finished, along with Barone Rotchil, without a jacket, because they both had given it to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in pants and shirts – designed by her hand – was transformed for dinner, wearing a long, very sensual black dress and excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the work, when they showed us the room for ballet sages and her, recalling other times, he caught a bar and beat a "great floor".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the palace premises, but had shown us the photos of his son on the cell phone before.
The next day we were happy for the presence of Olivier Martinez – another boys who moved on - and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and insurance in the past, who had no smell in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there's life.
1001, the number of stress
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frenzy of everyday life.
And as if this wasn't enough, they're all collected in a book that will bring the relaxation in the libraries on September 30th.
The wake is almost a punishment when it squeals every morning at 7:00 a.m. but it is even worse to imagine involved in the frenzy of modern life.
The office is called tension and computer bad back.
Stress is the evil of the twenty-first century.
However, there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhausting and fatigue to get rid of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond the yoga positions, the classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects on the pages of her book, all a "menu" of custom-made options for taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is entitled "1001 ways to relax" and its calmness will reach the libraries thanks to the editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone thinks that it is not possible to gain peace in areas such as work or in personal relations, this "manual" denies such conviction.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in touch with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline does not run out in your veins to regain body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, shut your mind and concentrate on reading.
Talk in the sleep
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very excited to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who speak are still asleep.
The first time it happens, at most you get scared, but actually it doesn't matter very much.
It is a benign alteration of defined sleep sleep.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Certainly, most of you have told me that you have spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode) or with a greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing anymore.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes episodes are related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, night enuresis (making the sleeping pipe), or sleep-abublism, but not necessarily so.
As mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stress situations or overcrowding.
In any case, it is a phenomenon not yet studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper, or that the opposite happens ( urla, cry, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, you might need to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to see if there are any issues that are generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a result of the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration, so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (e.g. when combined with insomnia or stress).
What can be done, however, is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
Offer quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that cause fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them to gain some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the dreamers appear to try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the day after it will remember nothing of what has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because it's not aware of what's happening, and you interrupted his sleep.
Although she's talking, she's sleeping and then she's resting.
Remember that if it appears very anxious and the episodes have a certain frequency, it is better to consult a doctor or check where it comes from so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to question him for information.
You will not get anything, because it is sleepy and therefore unconscious to organize its thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he is dreaming to say, so you need to pay very much attention to the interpretation of the information and to the conclusions it might bring.
Never tell the child you could ask him questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not for jokes.
Something like this is causing a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that takes just a few minutes.
Illhaeueren... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the road of victory at home after a long fruitful period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Giallo-neri created the largest number of network opportunities by transforming one into the game victory.
The rhythm was not much sustained during this meeting where the attackers expressed themselves tired.
After a first attempt by the captain of the Kauffmann host team who blew the seven with a shot away, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other caused the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick away, then Hirn high, Romain high and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie answered with a block in the middle of the field, leaving only the Riahi shooting at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed by Riahi and Temporale for Denmark, and immediately after the first Marais network for the Illhaeusen, well-positioned, took a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Cannoner of Illhaeusen will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be expelled a dozen minutes after leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Denmark will not be able to take advantage of it and will not put great problems in the Eleven of Illhaeuesern, sent back just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last minutes of the game when, after a rocking action, the ball blew through.
Sarkozy Meets Fishermen in Collera
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a step in Britain.
Prior to the demonstration of fishermen who brutally prevented access to various British and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning in the Finistère department to charm the representatives.
The latter promised to accept him "with a constructive spirit" and hope that "they will be present with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place just at the same time with the general meeting of the "crisis committee", created by the British fishermen in order to take measures to deal with the increase in the price of gas, which reached its record with an average of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Eliseo David Martinon's spokesman, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help companies regain competitiveness and make sure the working conditions and the remuneration of the marines."
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand firm.
Tuesday morning, they led the "lumaca operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of ingestion.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-Île have not been interrupted.
A roadblock was implemented on the Chiberon peninsula.
On Monday the marines have already proved their determination by burning, starting from dawn, tyres and pallets in front of the fuel deposits at the gates of Brest and Lorient, while taking out demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the fishermen remained at the mill, or Havre, where twenty boats prevented the movement of ships from trade.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Atlantic Loira, interrupted the closure of the total finish note by Donges in the evening.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday to decide any action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will, in fact, decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not give up" et "they do not intend to move to Paris", announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on gas, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, but they estimate that the cost limit of a vessel is only reached with a gas of less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home of Connecticut.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also greeted the legend of the film and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
This year, the construction company has 215 deliveries, despite the threats of recession that are affecting the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth global company in the sector, maintains delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, he delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian company is widely located in the Chinese market, especially for aircraft of the range between 30 and 120 places.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 flights to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would give more than 15% of its activities
The American International Group insurance company, set up by the American monetary authorities, would give over 15% of its activities in order to repay the loan of $85 billion, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is willing to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, states the newspaper on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to consider any transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at the AIG.
The activities that AIG intends to offer include the International Lease Financial Corp. airline, its share of 59% of the Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on such transfers, FT continues.
The AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the grant of 85 billion concessional loans from the Federal Reserve, while the US authorities do not have 80% of its capital.
Paris: chronistria Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange charged with a historic collapse Monday, after the House of Representatives had voiced against Paulson's plan to save the financial institutions: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, i.e. a loss ever seen, approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) is finished at 10.365,45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) above that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of major technological titles, has lost 199,61 points closing at 1,983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 has lost 8.81% (i.e. 106,85 points) closing at 1,106,55, at the definitive closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the sitting, Wall Street is deep after the unspoilt rejection of the bank's rescue plan, designed to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two Republicans in three rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"All this indicates how much the market was counting on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project was actually dying (...) then the witness would be quickly passed to the Fed – Federal Reserve – (the American Central Bank, ndr) and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, who was responsible for the financial and economic sector at Global Insight.
And while still stressing the state of emergency," every day that leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, Piezza stressed.
After the failure of the Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by the rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated rapidly, calling for urgent intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only in the face of an American crisis, but in a global crisis," FTN Financial analyst added.
The compulsory market has gone up strongly.
The return of the Treasure's Goods with a 10-year maturity is reclaimed to 3,632%, against 3,827% on Friday evening, while the 30-year maturity is 4,161%, against 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama benefits from the first television duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House, here is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general districts of the republican and democratic campaign have proclaimed their victory of the television duel, followed by a third of American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although worthy, was not brilliant enough to allow him to slow down his five-week polls from the presidents.
The Gallup Institute, of which a published opinion poll on Saturday, gives an advantage of five points in Obama (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the democrat had the best.
An instant survey conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them consider Obama the winner, while 25% point on McCain.
An excellent performance by his partner Joe Biden, who waited during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm on Thursday Obama's advantage.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He's got a good insight," said Bill Clinton this week-end.
Seventeen McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, stressing the "ingenuity" of the opponent regarding the arguments raised during the first face-to-face.
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that.. he has often said many times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills needed to become president," he assured.
What is a continuous target for the Republican television campaign yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without extending, it proved to be clear and accurate.
It has promoted its predisposition to the right decisions and its intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain never understood, contrary to Obama," he reiterated, this weekend, a democratic spot, reprobating the Republic that he had not taken the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, yesterday, Obama, before 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a rainstorm, for an election meeting.
He has not even spoken the words "media class" or "workers". The financial crisis goes in favour of Obama, considered by the Americans as the best person to save the economy on the edge of the precipitation.
"The next week could be a decisive turn," the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer considered yesterday.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's intimacies with that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current strike "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reducing the intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's results, Illinois's senator also mentioned among its priorities the achievement of a country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
With caution, the two candidates put aside the financial rescue-oriented applications of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) adopted last night the Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents manifested themselves on Sunday evening in the main square of Belarus's capital to challenge the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met Sunday evening after the closing of the electoral seats in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still pending, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignations".
Some admit that they have not even voted: "What for? They will do what they want, of my vote," says one boy.
I do not believe that the regime that has made a fine figure for external observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of goods, could be lifted if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
I didn't, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the roll-off of the votes," lamented Jouris Potemkine, spokesperson of the Union of the Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a face-to-face change, says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidency and head of the pro-European movement, because the important one is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If opposition Members enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can include a television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals."
The opposition therefore has the duty to enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt with Russia, is in crisis, and we do not provide for any reform, we are at risk of becoming a Russian protector.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe which has followed the electoral process recognises the validity of the poll.
It underlines that the participation rates seem too high and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) has led to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you notice that there were elections? Ask the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year in August.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will have been at least five Members of the opposition to Parliament, those most suitable to power."
The night silence falls on October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Committee are pleased with their success.
Meeting - Blood is again safe
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, since Hema-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, seriously broken by the scandal of infected blood between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a drama and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation in February 1994 , led by Judge Horace Krever , which aimed to highlight the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent a similar disaster.
While the judge Krever was delaying a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of designing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the reports of Gélineau et Krever, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide the Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Québec started its activities, as 38% of the people said they still had confidence in the system of donations in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalled.
The situation was deadly.
Thanks to the continued efforts to improve the safety of blood transfusions and the field research over the years, we have regained public confidence," he explains before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were many cases in Europe of the human variant of the crazy cow, a new manifestation of the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, who told the president of it since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't know at all if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of Krever and Gélinau's reports, according to which when you have doubts and you might get a serious illness, in this case the softness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, are taken of exclusion measures.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than one month in the United Kingdom was rejected from 1980.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that this disease has undoubtedly been transmitted through infected blood.
This episode so proved to us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for the identification of HIV appeared on the market: nuclear acid (TAN) tests that allowed donors to directly recognise the presence of the virus in the blood and not the presence of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have allowed the window period to be reduced, i.e. since the person contracted the disease to the extent that the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them is thus significantly reduced.
These improvements have resulted in a considerable reduction in the risk of AIDS being countered by a blood transfusion.
Today, a person of 12 million runs the risk of receiving blood infected from the HIV virus.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected by the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples each year, there will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion is found.
I believe that today you can feel calm in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the Hema-Quebec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by an insect.
Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient resources, and must be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary.
"The needs increase because the population is ageing.
Being the most aggressive cancer cures, patients often need a dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the number of donors, which on average is only 3% of the inhabitants of Québec acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people who are 18 years old and who meet the eligibility criteria can give blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of those offering themselves as donors are not accepted because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where the latter is disseminated, they will be rejected for a period equal to one year.
"With this 3% we manage to maintain an inventory capable of meeting the needs of hospitals.
The cases of poverty are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they age and cannot make any more donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to give blood, but above all to keep it and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so frenzy that you find it difficult to give blood an hour," says desolate Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone trappings, eyeball valves and skin that are used almost exclusively for severe rashes.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited at Hema-Québec that manages the only public bank of the blood of umbilical cordon in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which once was considered a biomedical discharge, there is plenty of blood rich in stem cells that can serve to cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion into the bank of our thousandth blood sample of cordon and we expect to take more than a thousand each year.
It should begin to propose them for trappers at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this blood take practice as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that you cannot have access," because Hema-Québec does not have the necessary means to propose this complex and costly program in all Québec hospitals.
Calcium - The impact in semifinals
The Impact Montreal qualified for the semifinals of the A series, winning 3-1 against Seattle's Sounders, yesterday, during a second decisive match of the final quarters, at the Saputo Stadium.
The central camper Antonio Ribeiro, marked the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first time without goal from both sides, David Texto and Rocco Placentino signaled the subsequent networks for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
We remember that at the first round of the turn-back on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in semi-finals.
Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunderler completed a first 3-1 in the return game winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still take part in the semifinal.
The impact will have to face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed in the day.
In brief - decisive network of Kovalev
Canadians and their axes are ready to begin the season.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, marked a goal, made two steps, and collected a passage for victory, in the fourth of the prepared games of the Habs.
I decided for the victory the only network signed by Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet, he warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to punish in the first period, he noticed Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a good ovation."
Charest Point North
The Prime Minister shall not exclude the opening of the elections before the end of the year.
In conclusion of the Liberal Party's general council, Jean Charest met yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to elect himself during the partial elections today.
"Enlarge the borders of our last large northern border": this long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday in Levis, through instruments from the strong visual impact, during the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
After him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Mulino to images".
On three maxi screens, there were spectacular negative hydroelectric digs, mineral cultivations, Quebec images seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means as in full electoral campaign.
During the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the opening of the autumn elections, even though he noted that he was very busy.
The "Nord Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often appointed in the most recent speeches by the Prime Minister, the opening of the North- the northern territory at the 49th parallel- was never the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, was limited to explaining why the North would be "a joy from the immense potential", but did not speak of timings or investment quotas, nor did he explain exactly what priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
More and more, it has been limited to pointing out what it considers to be a priority: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has experienced various improvements following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
Standing on Charest's list, the North contains" nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "large territory is the double of France", is here, is Quebec.
It is not only here, but it is instigated in us," he insisted, as he wished to encourage a myth of a national founder.
The foundation of Quebec is rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the fever of gold in Abitib, the national engineering, the Bay of James.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map to his shoulders.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, has specified the prime minister during the press conference.
"It's a traditionally maintained position by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been in force for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I will repeat that position on behalf of the government," he said.
In other words, considering climate change, it is necessary to reevaluate the North," he said, speaking of the north-west crossing, which will be open all year round due to the meltdown of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister estimates that occupying the territory is a duty."
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former member of the PQ of Hungary), have already given way to the consultation of a thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, where Julie Boulet (Transports and Natural Resources) is in charge of important tasks, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, not necessarily a summit, but a moment when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would in the rest be linked to the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be concerted, ordered and will respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the first liberal ministers who preceded it.
"As the liberals who have preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail in honour of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to reintroduce the Beauharnois Central in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Burassa, creator of Baia James, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963, used another reference, conservative this time, the program "Road to the North" program.
Faced with the project concerning the hydroelectric dam of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charest stated that its operation would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will do it," he confessed to his militants, causing them to hear applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April there would have been no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not cut off the possibility of starting a poll in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
It underlines that it is certainly very busy, in particular in a mission of the federal council in China and at the summit of Quebec-New York.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal Chapter with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of the "constitutional aspirations" which have been released like oil: the PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will be appointed members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that the latter will have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
With regard to the opposition, the text of the Northern Plan was adopted in a sceptical manner.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, has re-evaluated the Northern Development Policy of Quebec launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to you, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not respect its application.
If you had done so, we would have made progress today" said Marois next to the candidate for Jean-Talon (scripture today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has declared to support the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
"What we hope for is that all this is not simply perceived as a show," said the leader Sébastien Proulx, replaced by Mario Dumont, back today by the holidays.
Letter - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of the "Justice" (Ironia of the Kind) of Harper's cabinet, to allow himself to state, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "comfort" for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has fought relentlessly for justice and deserves all our admiration says much about both the presence of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are in front of a government that is the only, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated a citizen held in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a simple teenager at the time the guilty facts occurred.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, has refused its word and lets a child-soldier stand in inhuman conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, as a matter of fact, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers' Order, in particular, invoke the return of Omar Khadaf so that it can be subjected to a regular process in Canada.
It is exactly the same government that closes its eyes to torture: it matters very little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of upheaval.
There is no mention of it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", a word that Harper does not give up and sounds so crazy about his lips.
Here we have arrived at a time when there is no more morals: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until today's minority (to see what will be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that a party preaching the Virtue, the Respect of the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
It is here that shame, Mr Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinions - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world's largest aurifera company has sported a querela for defamation by six million against three authors and a small square editor house with the intention of launching a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a desire for defamation, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden from Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who supported a position contrary to his own.
Little matter the outcome of the process, writers and editor of the book Canada Black will have to spend a sum of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, at decisively learned weapons, against an army of lawyers funded by the pockets virtually without the bottom of the mining company.
In other words, in these fights with learned weapons, the tactics are often that of breaking the agreement in order to impose a consensus regulation that imposes the opposition in addition to scare anyone else to speak again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was first of all a public opinion that should have presented its own vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many countries where Barrick Gold is working, debates are normally held in Canada with the exchange of views and not at the expense of manpower.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to open its books, documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could shed light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to be too confident in public opinion and misappropriately rejects requests and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a public debate" when his contempt for the same public is obvious?
In the Vice-President's world, it seems that this word refers exclusively to those lawyers who are highly paid and not the whole of the Canadians; this is a rather narrow vision of the concept.
In a democratic system, even the denominators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn't understand – or doesn't want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Canada Nero does so first because he refuses the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchange of views, and not in the perspective of what many perceive as a sort of packaging (searching the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Nero an ultimatum in an attempt to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, Barrack Gold's love sport is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of the truth, essential in every democratic society.
It rejects the right to quote authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which form the basis for intellectual work itself.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss arguments with the richest companies in the world, who can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures of Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This goes beyond the university world, as is the case with the same public debate in Canada, and it is now time for governments to take measures to limit the abuses.
Operation - Rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the congressional capitals, representatives of the republican and democratic shift, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest saving-financial level after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new 700 billion-dollar version of the plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been on Wall Street for months, still needs to be ratified by the two Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: verifications of its actual implementation by the elected leaders, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money, new arrangements to contain the number of houses seized for non-payments, as well as a right to inspect the remuneration paid to the managers of the protected companies.
The US Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the representative of the Republic of the treaty table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day trial marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective agreement on markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been taken in such a way as to protect the American economy and people from the current crisis at Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, unestimable discomforts and disturbances would have turned on the daily lives of Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The time limit agreed was for the opening of the markets this morning.
After the negotiations, the two candidates to the US Presidency proved rather favourable to the agreement, but did not allow themselves to express their discontent in advance of the adoption of extreme solutions.
The democratic Senator Barack Obama deserves to have added some provisions to the agreement, in particular that will enable owners to maintain their own home and that inherent to the remuneration of the heads of companies covered by the State.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibleness of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to find out if he will vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze its details, but I hope so."
"As far as I've read it, it's something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move on"
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion-dollar plan is aimed at reinvigorating the taxpayers with the money of doubt, risk-and-inventive assets of the US financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that has led first to the collapse of mortgage loans at risk (mutes) and then to extend to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and to settle in the freezing of liquidity and in the disposal of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge of airing the first draft agreement last week.
It seems to have been out of that blind alley since the Democrats accepted that the active "tossic" of some companies in difficulty is only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone at the Congress, a provision was added that if the government had to face losses over the five years due to this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion will be added if the President thinks it is necessary.
The 350 billion payment should be ratified by a further vote of the Congress.
In exchange for its aid, Washington will receive shares of participation in protected companies that will receive dividends in case of profit and that will be able to recycle when the waters calm down.
As set out in the plan, the federal government will have the possibility to delay the settlement procedures for real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and the compensation paid to the directors of the undertakings involved.
From today, the plan architects would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that the free course will be given to their plan.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both in the republican and democratic setting.
"Of course Washington doesn't feel you," he said to his voters, Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Chamber's Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But of course you don't take advantage of the taxpayers.
Leader of a small group at the Congress named "the caucus of skeptics", the democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred prominent economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, have written us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to examine carefully the way to be taken," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, once again there was evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas found that it would have given up its competitor, in full failure after the loss of EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) for the risk-risk mortgage crisis in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of the largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It is not lost money, said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
On the other hand, there is a risk of influence and voting in banking matters.
It's certainly something that the rescuers and families now appreciate that the times are certain"
During this period, on the other side of Manica, the British government seems to nationalize another bank in the bank for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would charge all of the loans currently under way at the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that she will be buying the UK branch offices and customer accounts.
From the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalisation by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty of the blue eyes was his axis in the sleeve for a long time, for others his weak point.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the ambulatory smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have driven him out of that circle of powerful devoted to true and sacred monsters.
What a burden!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his connecticut ranch, after a lung cancer, remains one of the latest American cinema icons of the past few years.
Less monumental of Brando, which he resembled and of which he was along a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 by German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots one of the glorious visions of the American dream will be born.
A humble ego, last brand of quality.
Because in him there was a whole country recognized by the safe made man, the combatant of the Pacific War, proud in the fight, who at the beginning of the 50s studied dramatic art in Yale, later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, in television and soon to film.
The same militant man for civil rights was also the driver who classified himself according to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as six symbols, although part of a couple model since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward.
If they go with him the shadow areas of a private star, discreet, busy, allergic to the scandals of the show-business, of which you will never be able to fully reveal the mystery.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a heart-to-heart blow for filmmakers, while his great characters popularize the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is proposed through its interpretations.
They are confused in memory by the fascinating cow-boy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy unable to wish his wife Focus (Elyzabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the roof that was set up by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him in the arms of sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that did not keep what he promised.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone to history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, a criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Lasso someone loves me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean and taken after his death, who officially launched Newman in 1956.
That nice villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best film in 1973.
A bitter and vindictive billiard player in Lo Spaccone, the magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), the color of Martin Scorsese's money, which won him the only Oscar on 9 nominations in 1987.
That face over the years was his.
Even him.
The epochs happen through its path.
Young people know him especially for the cult movement Slap Shot-Colpo dry by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of a hockey team on little orthodox ice.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, brothers Coen.
The circle was closed with a last role as the father of the Irish mafia in my father's era in 2003.
Unlike the most legendary levels of the cinema that soon abandoned the trade, Newman will stay long in the halls, denouncing Hollywood throughout his party, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, defined it, with a point of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging you to exceed your performance.
The profession was not always a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, to which the roles seemed to fall like a mannequin from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalate to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholics or desperate, of which he expressed exaggeration and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown shades of his true, sensitivities.
The first time that Jennifer, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the role of the protagonist, was drawing a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost Scott's son for an overdose, dedicated the movie Harry and Son to him in 1984, discreet and sad.
Among the countless tributes spent yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old gunmate Robert Redford (they read together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a career of legend, a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a Hollywood protestor.
We would have starved his face on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging him as a bad choice of taste, though born as gag.
However, the proceeds of those sales were intended for his Childhood Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of adjusting to his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that said "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Try it, it was a privilege."
And it was equally privileged for us to follow the path of such a clean and generous American artist.
Citizens model, then, and much more.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & partners?
In the meantime, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will be discussed.
The political man and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed under a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including counterfeiting of documents.
According to the Procurator, the money obtained from competitive bands was used by them for private purposes, and they have often certified the performance of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million flowers, is partly ended in the banks of the Fiatal Balldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, known by the investigating authorities, they have received the money obtained from the tenders on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never fulfilled the obligations they have assumed.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To do so, the invoice blocks were purchased on the Józsefváros market, but circular stamps were manufactured in Kisunalas.
And in order to decide which companies to issue the invoices, it was established amongst others during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of the latter, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices for consumption, on the model of these, then invoices were prepared to be forwarded to the competition bands, among others, those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are works by István Lados and András γri which, according to our information, has drawn up, above all, the reports necessary to obtain funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "travel" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and members in 2003, the restaurant provided food for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
But so many people, according to the restaurant, would not all come together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in summer 2002 at the Jobb Jöv ̈ért Foundation, hereinafter referred to as Együtt in Harmadik Évesredért, is a stamp of formal errors and content.
One Badacsonytomaj pension has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay overnight, but in the invoice there were 130 guests.
However, the authors of the invoices full of fantasy exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., this also deals with a restaurant, in which the accounts - according to the information given to the judicial authorities - did not even appear the documents on behalf of the companies Job Jöv·ért and Hoppá.
Gyʹzʹ Farkas, the company's administrator, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to search and showed him the invoices, he immediately realized that this was false documents.
"On the stamp the name and the Iva match of our company were at a wrong point."
He added: In addition to the formal reasons he did not return even the fact that hundreds of people were housed according to the bill, when they have eleven rooms in total and there are not so many beds.
In the end, the invoice was restaurant and their restaurant is no longer in operation for a long time.
The tax collectors were not concerned to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, organizes only travel abroad, so they were shockingly indicating the invoice with payment in cash trips in Hungary, which did not agree with the company's billing practice.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, Iva was also on the invoice, while Iva was exempt from travel activities to countries outside the European Union.
Among other things, the amount of Iva was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Job Jöv ürt Foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company it was necessary to apply Iva to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the invoices, as well as the employees of the hotel only issued printed invoices, while the invoice manufactured was written by hand.
In addition, the "issuers" have broken down other invoices, in the case of an entity they have indicated how the transport of goods on the road, as is known from the procedure of the Search, activities which were not carried out by the company originally founded by investment advice.
In addition to formal defects - because of non-conformity invoice format, false stamp - it has been discovered that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt to Harmadik Évesredért Alapítvány of XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The falsifiers have not even paid attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, that is why the company's liquidator, according to our information, refused to issue that invoice.
They issued invoices knowingly
Another group of invoice issuers is those who were aware of the need to issue invoices.
The Esély Budapest Alapitvány Foundation issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Balldal - Ifjú Szocialisták for the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évesredért of almost 4 million flowers.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, has persuaded the director of the Kft. Colllab to issue invoices.
He collaborated with Zuschlag and also with the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million flowers at the Jobb Jöv ért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlas Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenny Egyesület Association, after which there was no real economic activity.
No movement of money because the prepared invoices were then broken, but the associations forgot to make this aspect appear in their documents.
In the following group of invoices issuing companies belong to those who are related to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to rescue the Director General of the Delta Trió Kft, with headquarters in Budapest but not detectable there, which deals with fuel and vehicle trade.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 concerning the sale of IT, for a value of approximately 18 million flowers.
According to data from the investigation, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kisunalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The Director-General of this company was a Romanian who would have forwarded the documents concerning the company to Ivan Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, has acknowledged that he has issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány and the controvalor was taken from him.
At Ivan Kubatov's express request, Romanian murals founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, in fact none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received a job.
However, companies have become useful to him because, at the request of the fellow attorney Zsolt Szente, editor of the company's founding documents, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generació.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued to the various companies 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million flowers.
The investigation considers that Kubatov has invested 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as Iva.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue invoices made for the Biztos Pont competition band.
Y-Generation and Sövetség in Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 presented a band for the Socialist Party's public utility agency, Tancesics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 head flowers but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the band.
To prevent this from happening, they presented to the TMA five fiction invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the Office of Arpád Kemexei at the Ministry of Public Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants, as they have already done, will probably refer to the progress in the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the accused number one, János Zuschlag, decided to raise the veil over everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and even though he has promised several times to talk about everything in a broad way, he has not yet done so.
It should be seen whether it is in his interest, it could also be that the Socialists have made agreements with Zusi, which, in exchange for a ransom of 50 million flowers, much of the damage, would be willing to do the spying.
For now, Zuschlag could also have offended itself because his requests for relief of his prison conditions, namely the granting of house arrests, have not yet been met.
While the authors of non-reciprocable commercial offences and causing much greater damage can freely or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which has not been granted to him.
The psychology of excessive bidding: why spend more money?
Buyers are willing to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economists researchers at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published on Science magazine, men do not want to stay behind in a competition such as the eBay auction, so they are available to pay even a higher price.
The research has tried to trace the nervous scheme of this "lot" at the level of the nervous system through experimental axes.
One group of volunteers played the game, the other group of players participated in an auction, while the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games participants could win money, but in the game of auction, in which the essential element is to bid more than the other, the body stretched under the brain cortex becomes intensely functioning when you lose the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the rise in price is explained by scanning the actual reaction of the stretched body.
In support of their theory, the research group economists conducted a financial investigation.
In this investigation, three groups appealed against a partner under different conditions.
The control group reported the actual value of the product concerned and made their point.
To another group, they promised that in the event of a win, they would receive another $15 prize.
The third group would have received 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost the money in the event of a loss at the auction.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them the gain was underlined, and for the other the loss.
Checking the hypothesis of neurologists the group members who were playing "against loss" were willing to make higher points of the control group or "winner".
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, these so far explained the phenomena that are responsive to auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding the risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation" - said Andrew Scotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when should you talk to your doctor?
Almost half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, but chronic liver diseases are mentioned in Hungary among the first causes of death.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis patients goes up to 100 thousand, of which only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know how to be infected.
The liver definition is the collective name of the infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between symptoms, typical are hepatitis and itteracy, but their pathogen agents and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen agent: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal loss, saliva).
For those travelling it is useful to immunise against the A and B virus, against the C no vaccine exists.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After forming yellow spots on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the faeces become clear and the dark urine, the healing takes place within two or three weeks.
A million people die every year worldwide for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, causing liver tumors and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason, according to estimates, is that only one person in ten receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver tumours.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because the pathogens destroy the liver cells in a subtle way, in many cases the first symptoms occur 20-30 years later.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical tests.
This disease is much more frequent than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, the drug addicts and the tattoos.
In the world today, the number of people infected by chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Because also a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease is worth addressing the family doctor when any unknown symptoms are observed.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, thus stopping the infectious power and can prevent the formation of tumors.
On September 30, it is the world's day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 worldwide by associations of patients.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis, to the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feel less pain?
According to a recent survey, religious faith works as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at Oxford University have had an interesting experience, examining how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
In the somewhat bizarre investigation, an electroshock was performed to 12 Catholic believers and to other atheists, while all who observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
Based on the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploration technique of the human brain, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for controlling the pain.
The test is the first of a series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University also take part, as well as academics.
The test took place exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrat and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci hermelin painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary originated a sort of religious status among the believers, while the Leonardo framework was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and considered it to be a calming effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this era of time received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the painting on a religious theme or the other.
The Catholics reported that the Virgin Mary's vision made them feel "secure", as if "someone would take care of them" and "they were calmed and were overcome by peace".
Looking at the religious theme image, they account for 12% less pain than when they had before themselves the work of Leonardo.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image of the strong effect even for atheists, but you need to find the right image.
"We need to look for an image to which they nurture very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the search.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it succeeds in changing our personality." - Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question remains, if the believers are presented the painting of a lady of Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber, what effect could it have on the control of the pain?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On the day of the tenth birthday, Google can claim to be in the pockets of both people and in the sky above their heads; he knows where they spent their holidays, which ambulatory they attend and what interests them.
But this, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors, is not enough.
What concerns the skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian encube, they do not actually see the substance of web 2.0.
Recently, Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as many personal data as possible from its users, and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google's founders that was: "let's insert all the information from the world into a system!".
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still in the beginning to be able to manage all the information.
Asking what would happen in five years Schmidt answered: he would like to know if Google could answer questions like "What am I doing tomorrow?" or "what would be the job that I do?", but software doesn't seem to answer simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the exact words they search for are recorded during their Internet searches, the IP address they are searching for, and the page that stops after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago users can store their browsing history, they can relate to what they have looked for and clicked, and these long-term results will generate much better results; on this same logic it is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our previously stated and registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they see what I'm doing? - the concerned users of the Google data monopoly are asked.
In most cases, the counter-reactions of the netizens are caused by the horror experienced by the size of the potential power represented by the entity, and not by the sense of guilt, by the fear of punishment, by the desire for freedom or even rebellion to power.
One fact is, however, confirmed and that all the sought expressions are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of the residents.
The most outstanding example of this in recent times has perhaps been the coordinated action against the pedophiles of Brazil, in which Google has forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that has enabled the identification of pedophiles from the website of the Orkut community maintained by Google.
The netizens concerned about personal rights, on the other hand, have been relieved in May when the company - in agreement with the EFF's electronic legal protection association - has successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: neither can you force Google with any point of the constitution to provide any information specifically requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully removed nearly 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search expressions regarding the confirmation of the child protection law approved years ago, but has not been able to obtain the search lists of individual users and the full list of web pages and keywords of two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data are spreading Google because they believe that this is how their private sphere is affected and private life is starting to use them and they are rising with the rebellion of the multinationals who are looking for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and the proliferation of computer enthusiasts, activists and users in many countries see in them the future generation of large companies, the cool corporation, unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as the world's winner because of Windows, because they both fight for the same goal.
This may happen because, unlike Microsoft, Google does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for their services, the source code always kept up to date and the software package is much more accessible, youthful and cool of the official software crash practice.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problem relationship between personal rights and the Internet, which implies one of the key words most often repeated in recent years, web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 speaks only of collaboration, to intentionally leave traces behind us and to use the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
A young average can create profiles in several community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists its musical tastes, all of which can insert them into systems like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs about which your most recent photo galleries are automatically stored on Flickr or Picasa.
Meanwhile, we read a number of examples from which it turns out that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common friends tour, comes to know easily who spent the night with her faithful boyfriend or a company can fire her employee because she wrote a sincere opinion on the company's top: one thing is sure, the concept of private life now has been completely reconsidered.
Whoever lives an online life makes it so as to show himself and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Whoever wants to hide something or just wants to avoid Google's monopoly can do it (for example, starting with Scroogle using Google's search system, but at the same time does not voluntarily leave traces).
Not few people who don't register on community pages to be found, Google's online applications, from the preparation of texts to image management and news collection, can replace with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile so far.
The public opinion does not even wait so secretly when Google will pull out the articles.
Currently, the company with its 156 billion dollars worth more than the IBM $140 billion), the Intel $124 billion or the Coca Cola $110 billion), the AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the entrances of advertising agencies, but the services introduced in record-time cause not only serious problems to Microsoft but also to many software development companies.
However, critical observers besides all of this find alarming points: the corporate summit, for example, has completely rejected the protest of employees after doubled the company's asylum law, has considered it too expensive to repeat the daily restaurant to the satisfaction of the employees, but this is misleading in view of the fact that in 2006 Google has turned the head of the Chinese government and, according to their agreement, the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to publish a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines from Google will take on proportions such that the company will soon be faced with the American Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this we can create our health profile with our references, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of fantasy writers, the story of the famous Cory Doctorow's Scroobed describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped the double murder of Ózd to make the tracks disappear
The police asked two minors about the double murder of Ózd, who were seriously suspected of having helped to clear the criminal records - said the spokesman of the Police Question of the Borsod region on Tuesday.
Young people have confessed the crime to their accused, they are currently being accused of favour.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI's information, defend themselves on their own foot.
The favor is punishable until 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old man from the scene, was put in custody on Sunday.
He's suspected of pre-medicated multi-micide committed for profit.
The survey showed that the young 20th-century man had a large debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to settle the debt, so on Wednesday night he lured his creditor into a Ózd yard where he and his 9-year-old daughter were killed.
According to MTI information, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the scene.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer for the purchase of Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the Prague Stock Exchange stock list.
Ludwick Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer advanced by the Polish despite the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in hand in the Polish state which intends to sell around a few months more than 60% of its titles.
The Czech financial daily E15 states that the Polish offer represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press so far, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have presented an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all the stakeholders the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead to the closing of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by the Česká Sporijtelna Bank with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday's comments on the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 11 September".
The global financial disaster has happened thanks to the American president - the accusation La Repubblica - who has not been able to compact his party behind a law quickly abolished, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as said the billionaire superfinancer Warren Buffett, it would be more accurate to speak than a second 11 September.
A part of Madrid's press also sees the spy capper in Washington.
According to El World, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world's economy on the edge of the creek.
The threat of the collapse of the American financial system is growing and will then be felt by the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the congress vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means of managing the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the history of capitalism is undergoing greater transformation.
It is no longer possible to ignore the threat - highlights the Geneva Tags-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still offer a bailout to the bartender financial institutions and with taxpayers' money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as a domino effect, then neither the financial means nor new solutions will be sufficient.
In the long run, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and to concentrate control on the financial markets left behind.
Only on Monday did the weak financial institutions get more than EUR 100 billion - he recalls the Venetian Der Standard, which seems to be increasingly real the anxieties that European taxpayers, like those in the US, will have to put their hands on their portfolio to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
The "salvators" must not immediately dissipate the EUR 100 billion, however it would be better if they established in which case it is appropriate to touch the taxpayer's money to prevent further damage.
The Smart Machine Imitates the Calabron Flight
What might be the best way to develop anti-choice technologies if you do not imitate the sensors of the obstacles found in nature?
For example, bees.
In the amazing project presented to CEATEC in Japan, the Calabrons gave the engineers Nissan the initial strategic idea of how to build the next generation of anti-choice systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotic mine with the properties of the bees, with the aim of creating a system that can scan all the collisions.
Flying the bees form their own oval personal space that looks really much like our protective shield - he explained to Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technology and research and development.
It is the role of the monkey view, capable of a view of 300 degrees in each direction.
Engineers have approached the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the monkey view.
The BR23C detects the obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor on board that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the monkey, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the incident.
This method of avoidance, unlike the current system, is carried out in an instinctive manner.
"If not, the robot car would not react quickly to avoid collisions" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must respond instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the harmful and more internal layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what ape does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in an eyebrow.
However, unlike the legs, the deviation cannot go up or down or in diagonally, it can only be bidimensional and in the direction of rigidity of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available for bees to scan other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can wheel on itself, speed up and slow down.
The BR23C is fed by batteries to lithium polymers, lighter and with high energy density, which means that their duration is higher than those to lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantaneity of the intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store it.
This robot must produce some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so use only a memory of a few decades of Kb.
You don't need a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions, which, according to Nissan, can be installed on serial vehicles within 10 years.
Further application options can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoids road obstacles leading to destination.
They also found the name of the expensive child
The written version of the Economic Savings Act of 700 billion dollars for the purchase of disproportionate loans has been drawn up, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the amount is spent.
In the new protracted agreements up to midnight on Saturday according to the Eastern Coast's schedule, congress leaders decided the 700 billion-dollar rescue plan after a debate that lasted for days - Reuters reported.
We have made serious progress - said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the House of American Representatives, according to which it was only left to put the agreement on paper.
Both candidates to the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
The Minister of Treasure Henry Paulson, speaking of the result of the compromise, said: the programme will work and will be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelosi, it is not about the saving of Wall Street but about the investment of the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets at 8 a.m. in Washington (the 2nd of Monday, the 2nd hour of Central Europe), but it did not make a big increase in stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the draft economic stabilization law 2008 concerning the programme, after which it will touch the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and then welcomed the news of the agreement with joy at the White House.
We are pleased with the progress made last night and very much appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Fratto spokesperson of the White House.
However, the programme differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which provided that the 700 billion dollars would all be spent to purchase securities with disproportionate credit.
Now as a first step you can spend up to half the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the Congress vote Monday, the Treasury Minister will purchase securities with disproportionate credit, and the remaining 100 billion dollars will be decided by the President.
A special college will monitor the programme to which the President of the Federal Reserve also takes part.
The expenditure of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of the Congress.
Under the Law, the Ministry of the Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can purchase at the same time credit, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of credit "poored".
The purchase can take place through auctions and directly - they have announced the departmental authorities.
The legal rule makes it possible for interested parties to take part in an insurance programme where the Ministry of the Treasury guarantees the means of concern for which companies will pay a price appropriate to the likely damage.
Henz Paulson said: the law gives the means necessary for 700 billion dollars to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, which is about the purchase of wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will do all the necessary steps to make ourselves ready to introduce the law just signed - he added.
The managers of banks in crisis and pending state aid think that the government will limit their well-being, defined by the ultra-ocean slang simply as gold parachutes.
The limitations of payments will only take place in some cases, and the limitations depend on how the Ministry of the Treasury will provide assistance.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry purchases in the course of an auction, it will impose a surplus on the gold parachute, if they do not send the bank manager down to retirement.
At the time of direct acquisition of disproportionate loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the directors' money is not excessive.
In addition, the existing contracts of the gold parachute will not change, the limitation is only valid for the new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation on the remuneration of general administrators - the democratic Barney Frank commented on the provision of the committee responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to adapt to a proportion of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can also gain if the economy, and together with the saved bank, will be restored.
The bill includes that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will provide for the return of the estimated losses from the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about the project from both sides.
This is not what American citizens have asked us not to defend the taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Member of California Darrell Issa.
His Democratic counterpart of Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by the same people who are responsible for the Wall Street crash.
Industrial prices continue to rise
National industrial sales prices in August 2008 increased by 0.1% compared to the previous month, by 12.9% compared to August 2007 - reports the Hungarian Central Statistical Institute.
The export sales prices of the industry reported in July 2008 were higher than 1.1%, but compared to the previous year they decreased by 3.9%.
As a result of the change in domestic prices and exports, industrial production costs were higher than 0.7% compared to the previous month and 3.2% compared to one year ago.
The prices of national industrial sales related to the previous month are only increased by 0.1%.
National sales prices in the manufacturing sector also rose to a minimum of 0.1% compared to July.
The higher prices in August 2008 occurred in the leather and shoe processing sector (2.8%), mainly bags and belts with 4.6% and shoe production with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price level of plastic and chemical raw materials has resulted in a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the product and chemical sector.
A decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical instruments and machines (0.9%) and to a minimum extent in wood processing (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, editorial and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the processing industry, there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices increased by 0.3% in August in industrial national sales, firstly as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the price of gas made by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared to 12 months, considering the domestic sales of the processing industry, the higher increases were in the processing of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacturing sector of metal products, the increase in prices was 13.2%, 11% in food production, beverages and tobacco representing a decisive weight.
A decrease in prices occurred in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the areas of the production of electrical tools and machines (0.3%).
In other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price increase varies from 0.6% to 9.1%.
Overall in the manufacturing industry last year prices rose by 10.2%.
The prices of the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector exceeded 18.7% of those of last year.
In national sales among target groups in the sectors, the higher monthly prices occurred in August in the sectors producing investment goods (0.7%).
In the sectors that produce consumer goods, prices have increased by 0.3%, in the energy and subsequent use sectors, prices have not changed compared to those of the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, higher prices were observed in the energy and subsequent use sector (16.8%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, the increase was 6.8%, a 1.4% reduction was measured for investment goods.
The prices of industrial export sales calculated in flowers increased by 1.1% in August compared to the previous month, compared to the 12 months, decreased by 3.9%.
The Hungarian flower around a month has weakened compared to the euro of 1.7%, compared to the dollar of 7.1%, compared with August 2007 it increased by 7.5% compared to the euro and 15.9% compared to the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a vision?
Kinginga Göncz sees the possibility that around 12 January the US-Hungarian visa exemption agreement could enter into force - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion, "now everything depends on the fact that the extraocean is built in time the electronic system of entry and control".
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be permission to enter, but before departure the tourists will have to register.
The responsible for Hungarian diplomacy will continue the negotiations in Washington from now on.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will give the medal of the Order of the Hungarian Republic's Order with Stella and will engage with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Also Barack Obama and John McCain complained in favour of the bank's rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, guaranteed their support on Sunday at the government plan of 700 billion dollars for bank rescue, but there are politicians demanding the resignations of the Minister of the Treasury.
The representatives of the Congress and the administration after the marathon negotiations lasting for days announced on Sunday night that they had concluded a principle agreement on the bank's rescue plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package of the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to show themselves more suitable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys with the first level of economic issues Obama has regained some advantage again, while the advantage of McCain, obtained after the Republican Convention with the appointment of Sarah Palin Vice-President, has disappeared.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed the hope that the Congress would quickly approve the 700 billion-dollar law.
He stressed that the proposal contained those consumer protection steps which were also supported by him.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn't let himself get away from defining McCain's economic ideas.
McCain explained in an interview with the ABC that "all those who will send down with difficulty this situation (...) but doing nothing is not a way out."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal included the creation of a monitoring committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outputs of the top managers, which he insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no merit in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Print description of the German language world
The right pole is intact, only within the pole voters have become more aware of car - thus Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The mirror (speel.de)
Franz Walter, in the online edition of the German magazine on the left, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known politician, the erosion of the CSU began a long time before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple got in charge.
The Christian-socials have remoded Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as is Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a great surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday a process was completed which was just ten years ago feasible: the indisputable hegemony of a state party ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was precipitated at 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 in the period mentioned in Stoiber.
This is the reason why modernization has been carried out in a consistent way in the region, which devours parents.
The sociologists predicted it 40 years ago, but they made a lot of time. However, secularization, the results of education, the placement of the Germans of the East and the North in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of the voters to the CSU.
Modernisation is a step in increasing opportunities and the political consequences are evident.
The right pole is intact, only inside the pole the voters have become more aware, critical, stuccoed.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the CSU has removed itself from the classic bourgeois groups: free professionals, artisans, diplomats and graduates.
Here CSU support is dropped below 40%.
The Press (depresse.com)
The conservative daily Vienna "Who with whom?" In the article "Chairmen of the parties are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confused Austrian internal political situation created following the elections.
SPÖ intends to deal with the OEF.
The OEPS prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections were held, and now everything around the coalition is rolling; in the public debate the party leaders just saw the cards.
Werner Faymann President of the SPÖ has confirmed that he wants to deal with the ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann has left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the ÖVP, as vice-cancellary.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Manyer has responded cautiously to red offerings.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not have happened if Faymann tries to intervene in the internal affairs of the OEF.
If his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition it is still open in the party, questions need to be discussed in any case within the CFSP.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ has repeated to be open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition we are ready to assume the responsibility of governing" - said Haider.
Járóka: The visual circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, organised by France this year with the European Union's rotating presidency.
Lívia Járóka, Member of Fidesz of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenary as the main rapporteur of the congress, drew attention to the segregation of schools because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimír Špidla, responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were the governments, the European social partners and representatives of the major European civil organisations and the defence of rights within the framework of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz PE parliamentary group, recalled, in addition to discrimination in the occupations, that the Roma are exorbitant from the labour market in the first place because of their low education.
"Most Roma young people do not have a middle-level study title and as a result of basic poor quality teaching only an unrestrained number of them can reach a higher study title."
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in the enjoyment of human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to make these links more aware in the wider context between the Roma and the non-Romas.
In fact, as soon as the school starts a rom, the more its opportunities to become a productive member of the labour market, the more the taxes paid for income and consumption contribute to the nation's budget.
"The right of European citizenship of Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools" - highlighted Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, the European Union's objective and action is necessary to speed up the process of deregulation of schools, and therefore it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be properly respected.
"The visible circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, it is necessary to give Roma children the opportunities granted from the democratic space so that they can contribute as citizens full of the future of Europe" - Járóka asked.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to ensure for all, the purpose of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised each year, since the Berlin meeting last year, is to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at the state and European level.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
By the end of October, you will decide the fate of the Huber-Beckstein packed couple.
Despite the poor electoral defeat, the discussions on personal matters have not yet been postponed to the Bavarian CSU summits.
The president of the Erwin Huber party and the regional governor Günther Beckstein are still in place, the question is as long as mercy lasts.
Of the kind of tandem that has suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the party's extraordinary congress in the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticised politicians have made it clear in any case that they are not attacked with all the forces at the headquarters.
So they tried to soften the angry inscriptions of the parliamentary group and the basis that one day after the Bavarian tsunamis, they claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the guidance of Edmund Stoiber, then at the end of his career, the Christian-Social Union reached 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber, 43.4% fell.
The 46-year-old CSU was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria that gives 18% of German GDP.
However, conservationists in the southern region of fundamental importance for the Hungarian economy will always be forced in the future to cool down in any way.
As the first signal of reorganisation within the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the narrow exploratory group that will start negotiations with the FDP liberals and with the Free Voters exhibiting right values for any government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke about the fate in the list of Liberi electors, that Gabriele Pauli, whose attitude against Stoiber was exploited as an opportunity to strike by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat the woman with no regard for the great ambitions.
CSU leaders now concentrate all their forces to stabilize Beckstein in some way.
Meanwhile, Stoiber will also have an active role to play in the shadow. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU defined on 28 September the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful to the CSU, according to which they would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be cancelled after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 if the CSU has played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the loss of the CSU's land will not adversely affect the great coalition of Berlin.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the injured CSU, but the social democratic crisis is still hard.
The SPD has achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposion: 110-0
A representative of the opposition also entered the Belarusian Parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of well-being and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that it is explained by the brothels made in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) hoped that Lukashenko, with a renewed presidential mandate for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections in the circumstances under discussion, would allow some seats in Parliament to represent the opposition.
The ODS has thus renounced a previously assessed boycott.
In the light of the opposition's expectations, Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, has demanded a credit to reduce the import of Russian natural gas and has agreed to give the Russians the gas that is in possession of Beltransgaz, which is going through the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter into the Belarusian political situation considered anti-democracy.
He referred to a distance that the OSCE, evaluating the electoral campaign, put emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on the presence of a third of the opposition candidates.
The OSCE's rapid report on Monday, however, also criticised the campaign, during which the candidates for the opposition in practice could not appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this opposition, an improvement in the political climate is perceived: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also prepared for a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of the South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state, considers the two countries independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - it has told our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the opposition of the 2006 elections, it is desirable that it remains, despite the fact that "the power has been afraid of even one opponent entering a Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not provide protests for the results, but rather tries to get voters to the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course we have many problems, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities have difficulty, but I also see that more and more people support the change, even among the elders - Milinkevich said that even the most officially assisted queto, that of the pensioners, considers the Lukashenko regime to be appropriate, which considers its main outcome to create social security.
Due to the indebt of the country and the increase in the economic deficit, it is only a matter of time that the social security disaggregation "which remembers the grave silence" - thinks Milinkevich.
In contrast to opposition policy, the Russian observers judged the elections democratically.
Mr Lebedev, President of the Independent Community, told the Russian press agency RIA News: "Men believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were turning doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But today he's taking this new measure against the furbets, against those who seal, and then he's going to drink a coffee at the bar in working hours.
The anti-fannullon novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The rotating doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services" the minister said.
"Now there is a new season of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta still points out.
With Palazzo Chigi it completes the installation in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of turning doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There have been no resistance by employees, the Secretary-General assures us: "There has been a process shared by workers and there has been the collaboration of all."
I mean, nothing more breakfast in working hours; nothing more coffee and cornette.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a beautiful cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand".
During a convention at the Public Administration School
in Rome, the minister then notes that "in three months the public employees' disease syndicates decreased by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand more workers in one year".
And it adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italian, " whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
In the meantime, thousands of public employees have joined in protesting the rules of the Brunetta decree, joining the application supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service is dropping numbers today about the least absenteeism at work due to illness - writes the consumer association - the people of the 'operative fans' are constantly growing.
In fact, thousands in Italy are employees of the right and productive public administration who have joined in declaring war to the illegal rules contained in the decree."
In particular, the Tar will challenge the exclusion of additional economic treatments for dependent diseases; the extension of the hourly stages of the recovery of the sick worker, including the inspection visits, and other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister.
Work incidents, Napolitano: "Creative Prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deaths compared to murders.
To draw attention to institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all Italian provinces the 58th National Day for Victims of Labour Accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the same tragic chronics of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, the Mutilated and Invalid National Labour Association, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "lifelong appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention at work, the protection of unhappiness workers, the assistance of families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"Of course, an angry 'almost', sincerely shared, has been lifted up in the face of tragedies that, for their size, provoke the slander of the media and the involvement of the public opinion, but the everyday reality offers us dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
In particular, they take the numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness by young people who look at the world of work.
It is necessary to pay attention to the phenomenon, not to delay the alarm on its social gravity, to apply and improve legislation.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini has stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which violates the conscience of each of us and imposes on all the institutions a decisive commitment to bring an end to them."
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not deny that the number of white deaths is impressive however," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "tender down" to become less attention, because it is precisely when the attention turns out to explode the tragedy.
"We believe that at a general level there is still too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our opinion - it has stressed Mercandelli - to increase controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school".
"It is a further effort - it has added - with regard to the communication and awareness of the public opinion.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility from employers in relation to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of protection provided for the victims of work" and "the aid law to which the system has been pushing in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to restore the worker's insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who are unhappy should not depend on spontaneousism or enlargement at times prescribed by the legislator."
Mp3 readers in charge, risk hearing
Listening to high volume music for a longer period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
As far as the European Commission is concerned, a communication published in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on emerging and recently identified health risks (Csseri) of the United States, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour per day while holding the high-volume device risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and cell phones at high acoustic levels can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings - the responsible Ue continues - there is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What is more, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, in order to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - the executive Ue concludes - confirm that there is a reason for concern and the European Commission will now consider together with the Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar equipment."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but concerns about the hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources are growing.
It is possible to limit these damage by using solutions such as reduction of levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee Ue points out that users of portable musical equipment if they listen to louder music (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours per week exceed the limits currently in force regarding the maximum noise permitted at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would cover 5-10% of users of these devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the United States.
Rome, Germany gives way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June it will drop the amounts.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which was established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once the beats are closed in March, the Junta and the Municipal Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official Bollin" of Campidoglio and its mayor Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are all political, social and cultural ideas - it must stress German - it will have to provide proposals for an idea of development in Rome, of which the political decision-makers, who remain the Joint and the Community Council, will then be able to benefit.
There is no overposition of roles but only the desire to have a place to develop a large project for Rome.
In March, he will finish his work and then disengage, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of inapplicability, given that its opinions will not be binding, Germany says: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If there will be quality, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
It is too often the policy to focus on the management of the newspaper and on the emergencies that are once again taking place.
On the contrary, we want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
Furthermore, the mayor of Rome tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a carriage zone: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a euro and it will serve to reason and involve the best intelligence that the Capital expresses".
For Germany, in fact, "there must be a strategic reference design, not closed or real, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which it absolutely needs, thinking with a unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the present municipal borders but will look well beyond" not only at the prospect of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but "even in view of the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? First President Anti-American. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who kept us going independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions tenthed the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
They increase attacks on Obama as the date of the elections approaches.
She wrote a lady from Miami on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big toast face: he thinks he'll win the highest charge of a nation he's ever had in all two governors and five black senators!".
In fact, they are attacks that don't say much; they are attacks clearly of racial nature and do not answer the voters' question: will it be a good president? Then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win and with a good distance.
Even in this case, there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the south of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the booth to vote we know well who will give his vote to the American patriot.
It goes out one side of the United States mindset covered up to the last.
"Tell me what you want, then we'll think about where to put the croquet, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama should win, we'll leave America.
What you have never said before, which seems almost certain to be the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasons, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89% replied: Iraq.
He's changing America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home to the football field.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to make bail.
However, Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to do.
Use, the economic strike also makes you feel like journalists: in the newspapers it is time to cut. And many blame the Internet, "kill" of the printed paper.
Fifty American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Well, journalists today are almost all pessimists about their future.
However, the newsmen have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is an economic crisis.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem to be solved, according to the interviewers, if you do not want traditional journalism as the big public understands it to be substantially out of the question.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today the U.S. journalist.
You are on ten newspapermen and executive seniors are convinced that journalism at national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The biggest publishing houses open a gap to the Internet, for many views as the "killer" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" warned journalists increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are hugging technology in the hope that it "makes something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap today in American journalism is among those who run the newsrooms - that is, the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure their reporters divide their values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this has to do with "working safety".
Executives who think they're losing their job in about 3 years are 47% at national level.
For the reporter's staff if it goes to 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a vast nation such as Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "take it or leave it", to take or leave it.
The directors receive almost always high wages, while the editor can also earn $10,000 a month, in addition to pension and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, the reasoning is complicated: to days after the first year, to days after the third year to arrive at 15 days in total after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, often get sick during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: THE ROOM TRIBUNAL, DANILO COOPOLA RED TO GROTTAFERRAT
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaud, decided to reject the estateist Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the Unipol-Bnl-scale counterpath investigation.
During the process at its post last week, he obtained the dismissal from the housekeepers who were transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estater could travel from the city of the province to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the Court, however, these movements (to which he gave the opinion) would allow them to influence their company and access to the evidence that they accused him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself some days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the 700 billion-dollar rescue plan of the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times confirms this yesterday by informing us that the current crisis is breaking down the Republican Party, increasingly divided among its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, especially in the Central and South states.
The soul, for the sake of the matter, which was made very much alive by the vote I was about to say at the outset.
However, this is only an example of the changes, of the major changes, which the current economic earthquake may prenounze or even leave the gap: not only in the United States but throughout the West, but perhaps even here.
Both in use and in Europe the crisis seems to act as an incubator of phenomena incubation for a long time and in the new climate they are solidified and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the renewal, the extraordinary relaunch, of the dual category of state sovereignty in relation to a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions that have, yes, made connections with the outside world, but which first and foremost involve the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
Which creates a political problem immediately for those who govern it: that is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, among other things, are also elected.
The crisis seems economically global but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of play or not to have much to say: the European Union has a clear proof that it is usually divided between the various interests and between the various state strategies is unable to decide on a common policy line.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects to be involved, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all the funding provided: since when it comes to the narrows it is only the States that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back to six.
They also have the necessary means and the right to use them: two resources of irresponsible value, in certain circumstances, of which no market and no international organisation may ever have to do the same.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the static-national element is still in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attach to a very closely linked factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of material, while we were convinced that the globalised finance was now intended to dominate the world, we have come to a conclusion that our future must, instead, make the accounts to an increasing extent with those very little material things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look a little bit, can certainly be transported from one place to another in the country, but are nevertheless absolutely bound to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
As for those who are to be sovereign, he certainly has several more cards than those who are not, to those who have difficulty living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that presupposes a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and so Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the request of someone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species, is so inadequate and full of shadows.
And together something even deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an inoffence, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire class leading in a growing number of Western countries.
It seems to be becoming more and more common, in vast areas of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far growing, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, having made their own time and being increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, i.e., feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the leading classes and traditional political essays, which occurs in the sudden "revolving" electoral or sudden events of the collective moods of these last and final times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavira to the collapse of the Labourist consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy has something to do).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say to someone, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not taking shape today in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis invigorates, increases, potentially acts to dissipate.
In the face of all this, speaking of a 'rebelion of the masses' on the agenda would be exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not for nothing.
The supercool to walk on the walls
Conquer the laws of gravity thanks to a super necklace and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of various American research centres and now a team of four institutions has gone very close to us.
With an adhesion of only 2.5 square centimeters, the scholars were able to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
THE STUDIO – The American magazine Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the study team is an evolution of those existing who use a particular structure of carbon, called nanotubes of carbon.
"The principle of the neck can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a stack of spaghetti" explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the gecko’s legs, covered by microscopic skin that can ensure perfect animal adherence.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the belts of these rectangles and at the same time "gets easily out of the wall," explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton University of Engineering.
CAMMINATION ON MURIES? -"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are drivers of heat and power.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
For the time being, I'm not going to be a superhero.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – Even the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented a microfibre adhesive as hair that self-cleans from dust during the movement on a surface to maintain a perfect adherent.
Pharmaceuticals: never with fruit juices
Attention to the pumping juice, to the orange and apple juice.
These drinks, mainly consumed in summer because vitamin dissantants and rich ones, if they are taking some life-saving drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with even serious health consequences.
To reiterate the risks of fruit juices both packed and fresh associated with the absorption of some medicinal products David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, which since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: enough a glass of pumped juice, orange and apple to reduce the absorption of some medicines saved, eliminating the benefits and endangering the health of patients.
The pumping juice was already finished under charge because it was considered responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotics, ansiolytics, antihistamines and neurologicals up to the toxic levels.
PHARMACLES IN RISCHIO - The same Italian Medicines Agency had reported it in an information leaflet two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mix and to take care of what you drink in case you take medicines such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT JUST POMPELMO - According to experts, also orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit the drugs.
Along the list of active principles inhibited by pump and other sugars.
From here the appeal by Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These discoveries in general are immediately reported to the various agencies of the international and national pharmaceuticals that may provide for changes in the information notes of the pharmaceuticals.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear, do not make us impressed but ask for clarifications to your doctor or pharmacist” the expert stressed to Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize for the Economy in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for the Economy was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a Neokinese who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editorialist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the choices in the economy and foreign policy of the Bush administration.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days that Enron fell, Krugman predicted in an editorial published on the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that led not to a few controversy and that for years it had been remedied to the economist, but that it has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and also a little shocked at the speed at which the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a publisher with a "very aggressive, particularly critical style against the excessive liberalism of Bush administration".
Open Office, here's the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of OpenOffice.org 3.0 release, the open source of personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most well-known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year by voluntary developers, whose backs watch SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the large audience with different news: to the welcome screen and to the magazine interface and made less broken, adding other more substantial ones such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version ISO.
Attention is also given to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as what allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them via email, or the possibility to import PDF files into the graphical processing module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
On this front you can always create "Hebrew PDF" documents that accumulate the typical graphics of Adobe format with elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
Collaboration is an element that has received various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene more hand in hand among different users, avoiding conflicts on changes in the text editor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded to http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
Besides for Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the CD installation may also be sent to the home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a train for distribution in the homes, it is precisely in business that the Open Office suite tries the big bet, already able to count on various projects made in public administration and schools.
And there are not even the realities that offer an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding video writing of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the Emulated Presentations of PowerPoint; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we are today at almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can also exceed the planned figure.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positiveness to the last Tour de France: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, third-class winner of the best climber shirt.
To report the news is the website of daily L'Equipe.
The 26th year Kohl is the fourth positive corridor to Cera, the third generation era, after the Italians Ricardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The tests on Kohl's blood samples are among those carried out in the last few weeks by the laboratories in Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counteranalysis confirm the positive in Cera, Austria will lose the third place in the Tour and will meet two years of canonical qualifications.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positive in the third generation era is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordy, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the positive to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian sat on the final podium at the back of Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, also adding the shirt to a better climber.
IMMIGRATION: NEW YORK TIMES IF YOU GO, IS ITALIAN?
Italy "from the country of immigrants has only recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with determination.
This is turning Belpaese into a nation of racists? It is how much is the New York Times in a long article that has devoted a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, the original Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what Nyt defines as the "north paradise": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" is recorded, but also the "highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support to the North League".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation of the Law which restricts the ban on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a paradigm for climate change in Italy.
The trend is highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students who are victims of rent up to 900 euros for a room
The rent market for universities is not in crisis.
According to Sunia's latest survey, the rent union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very serious characters to exclude whole sections of young people from the right to study for the very high total costs that families of origin should support - explains the head of Sunia's study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so deformed the market to initiate a process of generalized increase for residents."
In most cases, the rental offers then contain a number of violations: free contracts, unregistered, with no cannon limit, connected sub-loans.
In the case of Sunia, extraordinary measures are needed which, through the revision of the tax burden, can reduce prices.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a place in the Brianza area, there are about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Black Band zone) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence a bedside cost an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas near the University, they have to spend 250/280 euros on a double bed, from 370 to 500 per single.
In Rome areas near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostia and Cinecity).
It only saves if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed place and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples there are 300/450 euros for a bed, for a room it spends from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a place of bed there are 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a higher weight in the city economy.
In the cities where rents are more frequent to extra-Community students, as in Perugia, there is at last a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon requested foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradise, cities cancel historical halls
Historical cinematographic halls close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographes what is happening in the large Italian urban centres but also in the city of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the big multisales and the consequent death by consummation of the monosales in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that seem irrevocable and unconversible to us, but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and loads of memory," it is as if a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of street and many emotions," observes the director of New Paradise Cinema, the film that twenty years ago in Tornator was the Oscar Prize and the Grand Prize of the jury of Cannes, and that told the poetry of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way to live the lost cinema perhaps forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of the executives, are clear: in the last five years, the 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and to pay the biggest discount are mainly the halls in the main cities: 10 in less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost monosala cinema, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multisala cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exercise has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec," it is useful that new structures are built, but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its participants are willing to move to multiplex.
In order not to talk about the lack of appropriations for the fund in favour of the executives: the state's pre-debt debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not comply with existing laws.
To support the sector, between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million per year would be needed."
Interestingly, Bologna, the first Italian city, concerned with closures, has decided to run to repair with the signature of a protocol between Commune and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote monosala cinemas in both the historical center and the periphery.
The rules include tax relief measures in favour of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special tariffs for the stop and in some parking lots.
"It is an initiative that I like" observed Giuseppe Turnatore and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures.
It is true, however, that in order to counter multiplex corruption, traditional halls also need to improve the quality of sound and image, because today the public is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Paradise cinema", which I had been thinking of for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I go before the Rialto or the Quirinale of National Via now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so that I don't see the dust-stained cartoons I turn around from the other side."
Leagues between politics and arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to harmonise the choices of the municipality in the interests of the Pyromalli cusca."
The accusations are heavy that the magistrates of the Antimaphic Directorate of Calabria refer to the mayor and vice-president of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for an external competition in mafiosa association.
In mannets too, Joacchino Pyromalli, the old mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his lawyer's nephew, homonymous of the boss, already convicted by association to criminalize mafiso press, sentenced to EUR 10 million.
"In spite of any legal and moral standard, as well as good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay counsel to lawyer Piromelli.
"It would have been so granted to the cosca - the judges write - to enter officially within the municipalities by facilitating the possibility, already large, of controlling and addressing the public administration."
The president of the regional council of Calabres Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and malavit organized there are many" in his region: "These are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'drangheta', heroes who keep themselves clean."
This morning's arrests followed those of July with which the police announced that they had decapitated the Pyromalli shell.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved but already in 1991, and always for alleged conditions between organised crime and local administration, local politicians had been called upon to administer the Community.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, was elected head of a central right coalition, after the May 2006 ballout.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called in question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having architected everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the order of arrest signed this morning, explained that the Pyromalli cosca had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, they write the pms, "the availability to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a wider group knownly close to the Pyromals, uniforming the public administration's choices in the interests of the cow".
When the energy comes from the waves now they go down in the field the big
It is a long-term storage, which covers more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the world's major energy companies.
Where, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they put their eyes, and now they try to put their hands like Chevron.
The possibility of generating energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, the research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmentalists and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity requirements could be covered by sea-based motor vehicles.
This quantity would be the double of that currently produced by nuclear power stations.
And there would be currents and tides.
You know the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced, it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are more and more and more of these companies voted from time to time on traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technologies on ocean energy - he has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the U.S. oil strike to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It is a signal not recently, especially if it is considered that, in Alaska, the Uses continue to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new vibrations.
In addition to Chevron, there is the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the energy road that comes from the sea and the amounts invested so far, as not noted in the details, indicate an interest in excess, according to observers.
The technology to be developed.
Experts are still talking about a technology to trees, even because marine energy does not escape all the doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as Portuguese or some in Scotland are small sizes and do not seem to create major problems in the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies must be used with a greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a good system connected to each other.
The pressure of the waves, which moves the boe up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure from pistons and cylinders inside the gallbladders.
Pressure turns a turbine that feeds a generator in turn.
Electricity is sent to the shore through underwater cables.
For now there are four installations of this type in the way of design, waiting only for federal approval and part of energy could serve as a military facility.
The Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a commercial centre and parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there are the tides turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use energy.
After the waves, the tide.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, is now worth the potential of the seas.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely about the energy of the seas that have been like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others that look at the costs, they have already invested 7 and a half dollars in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million for 2009.
