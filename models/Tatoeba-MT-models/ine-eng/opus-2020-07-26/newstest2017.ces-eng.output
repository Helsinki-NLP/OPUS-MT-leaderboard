Eighteen-year-old chef found dead in a shop in San Francisco
Eighteen-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was on the steps of local trade this week.
But the victim's brother says he doesn't think of anyone who wants to hurt him, and he adds: "He finally started to do it."
The body found in Westfield Mall in the middle of the morning was identified as an 18-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, the office of a doctor.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and investigation.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia at the ABC KGO station in San Francisco said that Frank, who was a former chef in Boston, had his dream job as chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The Sons & Daughters speech restaurant said his death was "shocked and destroyed".
"We have a small team that works as a close family. We will miss a lot," the speaker said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank had first slept in the accommodations, but that recently “he had finally begun to do so.”
"You found an apartment, you went with a girl," Louis Galicia said to the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he doesn't think he'd want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to join his family, he always cooked food for us, made dinner for us," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to take part in any fights.
He was the brother who took things the way they were.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an unpaved diamond that looked up every day," he said.

The Czech routes have invested in modernising vehicles over 31 billion.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, public transport has invested over 31 billion crowns to modernise vehicles.
A third of the vehicles are currently equipped with air conditioning, and about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
However, the rates for modernisation in each year with the exception of 2012 are gradually declining.
Over 31 billion crowns have been invested in modernising vehicles in the last six years.
A third of the vehicles are currently equipped with air conditioning, and about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
The money spent was shown to reduce average age by two years in locomotives and separate units and by six years in classic cars.
A greater share of investments gave transporters to regional transport, where about 60 per cent of the said money was directed, and 40 per cent of the company then invested in the refurbishment of vehicles for remote transport.
The average old locomotives and units currently reach 19 years.
However, modernized older vehicles are counted in this indicator as completely new.
If the modernisation of vehicles were not calculated, the average age of CDC moving vehicles would increase in ten years.
They are about something older on the average of a personal wagon whose average age at the time of the modernisation is 23 years.
If only the age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, the classic components made up of wagons and locomotives have been progressively replaced by motor or electric units in recent years by Czech and global railways.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive died from 280 to 223 pieces, and the number of classic cars from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year also decreased.
In particular, the carrier had rid himself of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of locking the opening during the ride.
From January to July, the carrier let 110 of these vehicles crash.
For example, it is possible to introduce a purchase of 50 cars for speed up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to place on the international line of Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic high-speed routes.
The contract includes up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electrical units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We're totally powerless, admitting.
For a quarter of a year online edition of the newspaper Aktualno.cz is watching the story of the billboard in southern Czech Republic, which now attracts motorists to the visit of Lipna, where it is not only a touristic walk in the tree crowns, but also an Olympic park.
The managers of the highway know they're right there, but they say they can't do anything about it.
Similar advertisements are hundreds throughout the country, perhaps thousands.
According to officials, there is a criminal code that makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
The need is ahead of a complex bureaucratic wheel.
In the meantime, the company changes its name and the office is short on it.
Or it's enough advertising to move about a few meters and the official process has to start again.
Roads and highways were admitted four years ago: at the main bay from the Czech Budějovic in Lipno stands on our ground at the state road advertising billboard closely.
Not three months, however, the officials were not allowed to remove the unauthorized portable structure with a huge insert poster.
It's as if no one cares that they're standing right next to the carriage, in a 40-foot protective belt, where nothing can happen for safety.
Road managers say they can't just talk to billboards about the law.
You need to load it and take it away.
"That's not the only way we can afford it," says the spokesman of the Directorate of Road and Road Nina Ledvin and refers to the complex bureaucratic wheel that billboard removal must pass by law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began online today.cz watch in detail in the spring, but it is not unique and shows a general problem that cannot state and offices effectively and quickly solve.
In the south Czech Republic alone, the editor has counted dozens of similar mobile advertisements placed against the rules directly next to or near the vehicle.
So are other countries.
"We have difficulty in getting the company to remove the users," the head of the Transport Committee of the Czech Buddhist Country Office Jiří Klas, whose colleagues share stories.
According to Class, there's a law of guilt that binds officials.
First of all, it's hard for the billboard's owners to call to give the commercial away.
Although the boss's firm is often inconvenient or they know the fent, which has already been described in the past when the issue became more interesting: enough mobile stand with the advertisement to move about a few meters and the officials can put the previous call to the removal of the black fire in the trash.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard is.
"If someone moves her and coordinates suddenly disagree, she looks at it as a new device and we have to call the owners again," explains Jiří Klas.
The new law won't help.
The change could bring in a new law that prohibits billboards from September next year at the highways and restricts them to Class I roads.
Critics point out that the rules for the suppression of illegal and easily transferable advertising will remain the same today.
And the authorities don't care so much.
Companies can continue to make tens of millions of crowns each year on illegal land rentals and no one can.
For example, the billboard auctioning in July belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials are well aware of it: the Czech Buddhist magistrate is currently conducting three administrative procedures for the well-established billboards.
The company is threatened by a tripartite penalty in each case.
It's more of the ads that were placed without permission in the class I road protection belt.
The operation has not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Czech Buddhist Master's Transport Committee.
The ad, which is currently interested in.cz, although it is not yet listed among these cases, will soon arrive with the highest probability.
According to the speaker, РSD Nina Ledvin’s company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will then be reached on the country’s table and then probably to the magistrates.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can't be contacted.
He doesn't take the mail and the official seat on Zizkova cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company went to the South Korean entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who made a sharp argument with the head of the Czech brand Hyundai.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard company rents and offers them to the auctioners, has refused any connection in the past.
But this year in the spring, when RSD began to encourage Actual.cz to be interested in advertising in Lipno, Fischer let state officials send a letter for the secret company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where he is allegedly a new company.
Even from this address, however, no one has called the managers of the highway to date.
An empty fight.
Similar silence or translucent changes of seats are not uncommon.
One company, a couple of years ago, we were punitive for two million crowns.
She just changed her name and ICHO and it wasn't a solution.
The executor's case came back, the commercials went on, maybe elsewhere.
We are quite powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, admitting on the condition of keeping anonymity one of the officials.
No one's going to solve the bill in this respect.
Currently, several Members have spoken to the problem.
But they haven't done any activity yet.
On the contrary, Members who wanted to extend the term for the maintenance of billboards in the main Czech communications appeared.
The government has rejected it.
Billboards are not only for national but also for national and general policies very sensitive and some scissors theme.
On the one hand, they know about social demand after their restrictions, on the other hand, they themselves need to be instigated in pre-election campaigns.
I don't stop the relatively well-established notion that if something doesn't work, then you need to change the laws.
This year, farmers grow fewer crops, but more tails and pops, estimate statistics.
According to the estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, the harvest of cereals this year will be 6.7 per cent lower than last year.
However, this year's yield exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
Instead, it's going to be a drop of tails (at 3.9 percent) and pops (2.5 percent).
The crop harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers raise 7.2 million tons of cereals.
This results from a estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on 15 July.
The initial estimate was more pessimistic a month ago and predicted a ten-year decline against the lunatic.
The last harvest of cereals was too average.
This year's yield exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, this year, it's going to be a whole lot higher.
Peanuts grow by 3.9 percent more than a year ago when they received 1,256 million tons.
This year's crop may be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The expected decrease in the production of cereals is due to the reduction of the hectare yield by 3,7 per cent to 5,71 tonnes per hectare, and the reduction of the oscillation area.
This year's farmers sold three percent less fields.
The rice, which is the most important crop for the Czech Republic, is estimated to grow by 3.3 per cent less this year.
Farmers put her on more fields.
However, a lower hectare yield will be signed at a decrease of 6.04 tonnes.
The fall in five statistics is assumed in barley barley, which is most commonly used for the production of beer.
The decrease in the number of areas is 15.2 per cent, but also a lower hectare yield.
In contrast, the icebergs are born 6.3 percent more.
You'll also grow the grain harvest.
Statistics are estimated to be 1,305 million tons, which is more against last year.
The ossuary area was 7.3 percent.
Hectaric output is going to be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year the yield of the mustard exceeds the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, while the yield on the plot is larger than ten years ago.
In the last four years, there's also a machete field.
This year, the farmers sent him to 35.543 hectares.
By 2008, when the pop grew in the Czech Republic in the record 70,000 hectares, the field was half.
Thanks to the expansion of the oscillating areas, this year's landing will make it richer.
Anti-harvest levels of 2.5 per cent to 27,423 tonnes.
Hectaric output is going to be 6.1 percent lower.
The law enforcement officers accused two men of assaulting the knife and the machete, and the court sent them to jail.
The police accused two attackers who attacked a 15-year-old man with a knife and a cat in downtown Olomoce on Tuesday.
"Despite trying to escape the attack, he suffered severe and severe injuries, which he had requested treatment at the hospital and other treatments," said police spokesman Marie Štrbáková.
The two plaintiffs were detained immediately after the attack.
The plaintiff filed a motion for a court to be taken into custody, and the court ruled on him on Friday.
Both men are threatened by three to ten years in prison.
The police accused two detainees of assaulting a 15-year-old man in downtown Olomoce with a knife and a knife.
The attackers caused him severe and severe injuries, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people who became police officers on Tuesday in the south of the Svobody class.
Pachatels ended up in custody, reported by the Olomoucian police spokesman Marie Štrbáková.
A collective drive between the two families took place in the garden area in front of the Trattoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouce.
After the aggressive verbal opposition, two attackers were attacked by a 15 - year - old man with a knife and a cat.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, he was subjected to severe and severe injuries, which he had requested treatment at the hospital and other treatments, a police spokesman told him.
At the rally, which aroused a great deal of attention in the city center, and for which several police guards and guards had to intervene on the spot, it was a family dispute.
The criminals of a 40-year-old man from Slovakia and a 70-year-old man from Olomoce have been accused of trying to seriously harm health and expropriation.
The complainant filed a motion for a court to arrest them and the court ruled on him on Friday, supplemented the speaker.
At the center of Olomouce, the attacker was also used five years ago, so it became only a few dozen meters away, before the discotheque Varna in Riegrov Street.
At that time, the police stated that a group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the guests of the company who stood before the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, holes and cats in their hands.
The court then ordered two attackers to punish the sentence.
abandoned and empty houses in central Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most striking examples of an unused and empty house is the extensive construction of the former IPB site in the middle of the Senowing Square.
That was supposed to work as a hotel a long time ago.
It's just nothing.
That you need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the centre of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Václav Square, there are several crime houses that, despite their location, size and often even memory protection, are empty and empty.
We chose real estate in the center using the project Prazdnédomy.cz, which maps the length of the empty property in the territory of the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of the financial problems of their owners, of intransigence between companies or belong to a state that does not know or wants to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
If the owners pay a special tax, they want an initiative

Clinton's husband made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax confession.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars were spent on Clinton's charity.
Most Clinton's revenues -- over six million dollars -- are due to their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax confession.
The candidate for US Democrats to President Hillary Clinton published his tax returns on Friday, raising pressure on his Republican opponent Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, announced the AP agency.
Most of Clinton's revenues - over six million dollars - are for their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015 when Clinton started his campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that Clinton's husband had a federal income tax of 34.2 per cent last year and then tax of income at the state and local level of nine per cent.
So they paid 43.2 percent of the income tax.
But Trump has a similar problem, so far he has not decided to publish tax recognition.
It's possible that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, wrote Clinton on the Twitter a few minutes after his confession.
Clinton repeatedly returns to the secrecy of Trump's revenues, among other things, to raise doubts as to whether her rival is really as rich as she claims, the AP has introduced.
The trumpet's worth of money is estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower benefit would damage the reputation of the Republican candidate as a successful entrepreneur.
Senator Tim Kaine, who, in tandem with the former first lady, is running for the post of vice president, today published a report on his tax deductions in the last ten years.
Together with his wife, Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 percent of their income on charity and spent 25.6 percent of their earnings on taxes last year.
In Nigeria, she broke up again.
The Islamists from Boko Haram defended their belief, and the doctors killed them.
In Nigeria, cases of child abuse have reappeared.
In the northeastern part of the country, the government declared extraordinary expectations because there were two children infected with this disease.
Vaccines were transported there by helicopters.
In the affected area, Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram, who defended the doctrine and even killed the doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was undetected there.
In the northeastern part of Nigeria, children are being subjected to an emergency to attack because two children were protected there.
In Africa, the virus was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government announced that in the state of Borno there would be millions of children and four million more in the surrounding countries.
The Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to the AP agency, quickly transported vaccines against children's defences to the affected northern part of the country, where Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram act.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the virus has been undetected for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram in the past have defended the pancreas and even killed the doctors.
Their attacks on Thursday also made it impossible for doctors to reach areas where children with guns were found.
Both affected battalions came from refugees in Nigeria recently freed from Boko Haram.
The head of the WHO section responsible for the release of the Michel Zaffran branch said the BBC station is beginning to kick in in Nigeria next week.
In the state of Borna, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram has been active for a long time.
The area was made accessible by international organizations and governments until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken in this part of the country in a fundamental way.
The Nigerian Minister of Health Isaac Advole admitted that the new defence cases were a major disappointment for the country because Nigeria wanted to declare next year that the defence had been exposed.
WHO noted that it is possible that although the disease has not appeared for two years, it has spread among children.
They're gonna have kids under the age of five.
In 2012, Nigeria was one and a half of the world’s defence cases.
While it was still in 125 countries in 1988, it is now only in three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the moving stories of fallen women.
Pope František met with twenty former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, had escaped from the gang.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
František wanted to draw attention to this meeting and to call for a stronger fight against it.
Pope František met with twenty former prostitutes in Rome who were released by the police from the power of a gang of passports.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the moving stories of fallen women and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, led by the Vatican spokesman.
Among the former prostitutes that František visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is about 30.
According to the Vatican, all were exposed to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution.
The visitor wanted František to pay attention to human trafficking and to call for a stronger fight against him, he introduced the pope’s spokesman.
František often points to the fates of people on the edge of society.
For example, on Thursday, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this year in April and in June thanks to his personal invitation.
France is going to hit the production of the Jedi.
But without the help of Muslims, it won't work.
The French have the help of Muslims themselves in the fight against radical Islam.
The government of Prime Minister Manuel Vals is also about to change the fundamentals in the functioning of mixed and spiritual education.
Since last December, we have closed 20 blends and prayer.
And the others will follow, the minister has announced inside.
In the country, it works over a hundred Jedi productions.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be even harder for France to guarantee this recognition of freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, it is intended to ensure that only the persons who have been educated in France are taught in the mixes and prayers.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding from mixing abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad to build new blends, most from Morocco, Algeria and the Persian Gulf.
And that's why they get teachers who can spread radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the Prime Minister added.
The key that will ensure his achievement of these goals will be the new French Islamic hope.
It should function as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
In the country, the French Foundation for Islam, which was established by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
By then, the funding had to contribute to the simplification of the financial flows between the blends and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institutions soon came to grips with internal disputes and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," observed Valls recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate was opened on a new institution that will replace the non-functional reward.
All stepped up further terrorist attacks in France, which on behalf of the Islamic State have carried out radicalised Islamists.
French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently heard that a new award would be made this October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure financing mix of domestic resources and also to watch the images.
In the meantime, it is not clear where it will take money not only to build new blends, but also different educational centers.
But he's considering a few proposals.
One of them is a special fee or a food tax.
In practice, the sellers would pay for the food, which is for the certification.
Some of this money would then travel right into the cash donation.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 kroner) could then be paid by French passengers who are issuing to Mecca.
Every year they go there for a traditional tour to Saudi Arabia about 30,000.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only teachers who have passed special education programmes at French universities should be involved in the mix in the future.
This should ensure that the preaching is in line with democracy.
We'll close the radical mix.
At the same time, the French government is fighting radicals.
And the others will follow, the Minister has recently announced inside.
In France, there is no place for those who declare hate and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
In the country according to estimates, about 2,500 mixes and prayers.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islam.
Since 2012, the authorities have made up about 80 species and several other decades have considered it.
But not everyone thinks that the government's steps can significantly affect radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
In fact, it is not in the mixes that young people radicalize on the Internet, Severine Labatová, an expert from the National Research Centre.
Driver Kelemen lost in the 1st round of sprint with the Baugem star.
The procedure for the eight-wheel drive must be carried out by the Czech road cyclist in the correct driving.
The leading cyclist Pavel Kelemen in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, after the qualification of the sprint among the top eighteen, lost in the 1st round a match with the French-sized Grégory Baugem, the silver defender of the previous games in London.
The procedure for the eight-wheel drive must be killed in the right-hand drive.
At the start of the royal discipline on the track, 27 riders were built and the best Czech driver at the moment signed up for the fourteenth best time.
The two-year-old starter arrived in 9,969 seconds.
In the main exhaust phase, he was expected to be qualified by the fifth Baugé, who already has the bronze in the team sprint from Rio.
Kelemen finally reached out to the experienced French, but he took a look at the procedure.
With a great performance, Jason Kenny's gold protector shined out.
Eighteen-year-old Brit took the third fastest double of history and qualified in the Olympic record 9,551.
Easy then, as expected, he also consulted the latest German Maximilian Levy.
There was also a British quartet with Bradley Wiggins, who took a new world record 3:50,570 to the finals in the race for 4 km.
The average peak (3:51,659), which was four years since the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young Doctors Press: Wanting a Fresh Wind in the Field
Representatives of young doctors met to approve new steps in their new contract dispute.
The Board of Young Doctors (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the full board to support further sectoral actions early in September.
JDC says the ministers were unable to resolve the issues regarding the contract.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted against the agreement agreed with BMA.
58 % of its members who participated in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to the members published on Thursday night on Twitter, President JDC Ellen McCourt stated that the government remained "still quiet" on questions, which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: “In this light, the JDC’s voting power has decided to reject the proposed new contract completely and to request a new formal procedure in all matters.”
In response to the government's silence today, the JDC Executive Board formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council with a view to approving the ongoing programme of accelerated sectoral actions early in September.
The dispute led the young doctor to a six-story announcement this year, including the first general reports in the history of NHS.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malavan, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
BMA members at meetings before the vote in front of 54 000 young doctors and medical students said that the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said the contract would mean a burden for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: Associations "inseparable"?
It was the gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to lay their hands and announce the formal end of eight months of long verbal wars and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish opposition to the overcrowded palace in Petrohrada, I felt that Ankara wanted more after this reconciliation.
It came to hand-hand, yes.
But Putin didn't smile, and he barely got the heat out of him, and that's according to his standard.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke about his " dear friend" to Mr Putin - five times, as one of the news reports.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their level before the crisis, but they would be even better.
The next day one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan was acting like nothing bad ever happened.
According to his enthusiasm, I saw the exact opposite.
But the constant cold that he had fired from Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement: Shooting the Russian warplane Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction back then was devastating.
Putin was hurting himself and Ankara accused Moscow of killing a knife in the back.
The deterioration was greater than it was from the alleged friend.
Rebuilding real faith will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media carried out a massive global campaign against Ankara a month later.
Suddenly it seemed like the Turks could do anything.
More serious was the accusation from the top state representatives that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly opposed this.
But there was an official message in Petrograd that it was time to move on.
The end of this meeting was only because Putin had an apology requested by President Erdogan.
Russia could also declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the declaration are quite clear.
In the first row, Erdogan was almost powerless last month during an unscrupulous storm and therefore needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey are also visible.
There's also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a hard impact - especially the cancellation of charter flights, which will transport several million Russian tourists each year on the Turkish coast.
This figure was reduced by almost 90 %.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will breathe here when the flight renewal occurs.
They earn on Mediterranean travel in the end of the season.
Even this week, the state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when it was again allowed to import agricultural commodities from Turkey.
"Tourists there, paradise back here," as reported in the Vedemas newspaper.
The visit, however, had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry for what it considers to be a failure to react to a reversing attempt.
In addition, the long-term non-violence of long-term EU accession talks and Putina's accession, which is moving ahead in order to use and break Turkey's path to the West.
The Russian leader certainly won the bonus points when Ankara asked for the help of the elected authorities after attempting to push.
You must understand that for Moscow, who has a deep-rooted fear of changing the regime, it is given.
So the summit in this spring, the Baltic Palace of Russia and Turkey made it possible to introduce what one analyst described to me as "a union of inconsistency": how they connect the forces of two countries that feel rejected and used by the West.
Despite public reconciliation, however, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently became a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey stand on the opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three-hour opening talks, both presidents at the press conference stated that they had not mentioned this question.
The Turkish President deliberately answered the question of differences between them, while Putin decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both States could find a common word on the question of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of a complete disaster when a member of NATO shot the Russian warplane - it is certainly better that both leaders speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS mark should be pressed into the role of the back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS mark was connected to the global ambitions of the bank.
She came out of them when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At that time, the strategic brands were used by RBS to protect other brands of consumer finance.
It was followed by millions of pounds spent on sponsoring international sports, from the six Nations football championship after Winbled andy Marraye.
Now, however, it has been decided that it is better to make more of the national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but it won't start a new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of the center and the stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Ulster Bank brand is already in use.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will get more ahead - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During the trip to customers and employees in the Inverness-shire, McEwan answered our questions, Ross McEwan.
The BBC Scotland Station said: "The RBS flag will cease to be our investor mark and mark for which our employees are working, because we are now becoming a much more brand bank."
Because the bank itself became a global brand, it became a global brand and RBS.
Now I'm saying we don't have global aspirations anymore, we've got domestic efforts.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue in its sponsorship of the Six Nations championship, prepared a profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
"It has been a good time for us to move to a brand bank, because the basic question (which we are asking) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" the Executive Director said.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical if we said that we would become a great bank for customers and the brands.
But together with how we focused on customer needs, and not on our own, I think there's a lot of changes going on.
We can mention these marks again, I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on the horse Predilection led to the goal 3000. winner
Dettori dissipates champagne after the double victory in Newmarket brought him 3,000 victories
Jack Frankie Dettori won 3,000 winnings in Britain on Friday in New Market.
This lover achieved his second victory in the evening on his local track - on the horse Predilection, which John Gosden is training.
Four decades of Italy is the sixth hooker, which has achieved this result in the equations.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
The three-way champion of Dettori, who previously won on the Ghayyar horse, said, "It's strange."
I'm very touched because my family is here, too.
I'm so glad it happened in Newmarket, because I was stuck here 30 years ago.
It's not a big deal, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I've had a good time, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings Predilection after victory
Two joggings of this mill were achieved in obstacles - a Richard Johnson jogging champion and a 20-person champion on the board Sir Anthony McCoy, who led more than 4,300 winners during his careers in record-taking.
Lester Piggott, 9th winner Derby, 4 493 winners in the career
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times, and it's not surprising that he's reached a milestone that only a few riders have achieved before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's just his tactical fistron that distinguishes him from the other riders in the weight.
He is a fantastic ambassador of achievements, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he hadn't just been out on weekends and big hits, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
It's true, though, that Frankie drove a winner in Great Britain for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a living nature, which is good for British sports, but more importantly, he's an incredible gambler.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous summer shock
From the summer finish after the summer shock - Frankie Dettori was a two-decade of British level achievements.
It was like a ride on the mountain road.
Unprecedented number of winners of the major races, including his famous "great sevens" in Ascot. He also survived the plane crash and had a ban on the launch of drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned after six months of banning the start, he showed incredible inner strength and returned to all doubters in the best form.
And maybe it won't last - Dettori already announced that he would like to continue in the race for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin missed President Sergei Ivanov's chief office
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly left Sergei Ivanov out of office as head of the president's office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest collaborators for many years.
Ivanov was appointed a special representative for the environment and transport.
The Kremlin declaration states that Putin “has released Ivanov from his service to the head of the Russian presidential office”, but there was no reason.
His place will be taken over by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's representative since 2012.
Forty-four years old Warden was a diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, promoted at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the website (in Russian) it is stated that he was later the head of the presidential protocol and the president's office.
At the appointment of Putin, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your head of state activities in terms of the draft laws and control of the extent to which your guidelines are respected.
Putin said on Friday at the Russian TV station that Ivanov asked her to be released from the post and recommended that he replace her just Warden.
Can you believe the smiles?
This step was totally mystical to Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has been one of the closest collaborators of Vladimir Putin for a long time and as well as Putin worked for the KGB.
As head of the president's office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who broadcasts state television, both men declared that the head of the presidential office was going to his own request.
But the smiles in the cameras have convinced only a few people - especially now, right in front of the parliamentary elections.
So this is the result of a struggle of power?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who once thought himself to be a possible president wants to lead an environmental policy of Russia, suddenly met with great mistrust.
On Kremlu’s pages are quoted as saying to Putin: “It’s true that in 2012 I asked you to give me this very demanding post, even to say a problematic post, he spent four years in the interview.
Looks like I've been the head of the president's office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov was arrested in December 2011.
Formerly, he was the vice-president of the government and the Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin led the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his representative.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
It was even speculated that Ivanov could become the successor of Putin in front of the State after his second election period, because the third period would be anti-constitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close companion of Putin's, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin went back to the presidential office in just three and a half years later as prime minister.
Thomas Gibson, a serial star of the idea of a criminal, was released after the director struck.
Gibson's last month in Los Angeles was involved in the physical exchange of views on the scene.
The TV stations ABC and CBS, which produce the series, have announced their release in a joint declaration.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before announcing his release.
There have been creative differences on stage and accidents.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in a statement.
According to TV stations ABC and CBS, details are about how Gibson's character disappears from the series that follows the stories of the FBI team, a bit later.
A 14-year-old actor, whose main role in the Dharma and Greg sitcom, has been in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thoughts of criminals and have given them hearts and souls over the past twelve years," Gibson stated in his statement on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be in it by the end, but it's not gonna be possible right now.
I would still like to express my thanks to the authors, the producers, the actors, our amazing team, and above all to the great fans in which this show could have hoped.
Returning the series to the twelfth series is expected on September 28.
In the city of Banff secretly landed in a fish garden
A man from Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be sandstones that left the water.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a short film of his findings on Periscope's canal in the belief that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters of fish were caught in his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects with Fife
Project for 1.35 billion libre is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the north and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
This is the first of the four closures between the "floor winds", which are now almost finished around each of the three bridge pillars.
The part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
There are 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 suspended wires.
The project for 1.35 billion libre is to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the fortress to the bridge.
He said: “This is the historic moment and symbolic moment of Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we all witness how construction engineers actually used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the width of the bridge was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
In its place there is now a total of more than 79 % of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last part of the surface is now being flown in Rosyth, so the whole area is ready to rise to the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first closure in building each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this wonderful project, this closure represents the tip of the earthly structure.
After installation of the last part of the road surface and its connection to the expanding North Tower surface, we had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We've done this through the northern approximate route of 700 millimetres south.
This was massive and at the same time very delicate.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and it was necessary to stretch it with a climb of about 3 %.
Decisive because the tolerances he worked with were very small - just a few millimeters each direction.
Everything went very well.
Saved in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “happy to be alive”
Three men are "happy that they are alive" after the water from their fishing boat had burst into England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station announced a strike on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw an incident in the Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim safely while their boats continued undriving.
"We've seen their boat circling in their vicinity and we've come up with the worst of us," said the rescue shipr Moelfre Vince Jones.
"The strong wind took her luck away from them before we left," he added.
Two men saved the local fishing boat, a third man at the age of 60 was found without a rescue vest worn out, holding the battles.
All were transferred on board the coastal rescue boat and transported back to the rescue ship station
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy that they are alive and completely without injury.
The ship's engine had a rope for emergency shutdown, but somehow it came to its connection from the person who was driving the boat when it came back.
Someone was holding a guard arm over those guys.
The judge refuses to deal with the case because of the wife of Tluchoch.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three Members who, according to the complaint, were to be received from the Prime Minister of the Untime and his then head of the Janya Nagy's political traffic office, i.e. the lucrative post for political action.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Schnydr, Fuksa and Tluchoř made it possible by their resignations.
Then they showed up at the influential positions in state companies.
And that's why they also faced suspicions of payment and ended up in jail for a month.
According to the court, however, it was not justified, and the compensation was thus paid to nearly 2 million crowns.
The fat person is now in charge as a witness, and this is after the Supreme Court's interference.
His wife works in the fruit market court building and settles civil disputes.
However, she wants to be the Judge of the King (resolves criminal matters - no. reg.) and avoid possible opposition.
The case is likely to cause concern to another Prague court district.
The Queen then released the guilt of Jan Nezeit, before Nagy.
It was a alleged abuse of military intelligence to monitor Prime Minister Not Time Radka's first wife.
In this case, Tluchoř did not form.
According to Lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, however, it is an overreached reaction.
I don't think impartiality can be so ruled out as to rule out whether witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid then it wouldn't be a trial at all, marked for the diary.
"I think it's crazy," he added.
In the case of political traffic, Roman Boček, former official, is also accused.
According to his lawyer, Peter Toman, however, any objection would have a chance of success.
The District Court for Prague 1 held a 13th June complaint against a former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petra Nekzee Janny Nagy (now Nekzevo) and other accused of abuse of military intelligence.
There's a stranger coming to court with his husband on the video.
The fat guy was supposed to address Perutkov's judgment.
For example, the wife of the exhibit had to judge President Milos Zeman's sentences on the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutkovi.
Zeman said he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl must have died in the plane crash of the joint forces.
In Syria, along with her two equally old girlfriends, she flew out of the London Gatwick airport last February.
The British Ministry is not commenting on her death.
Young Londonmen who fled their homes were secretly transferred to Syria, according to the police, across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begumová, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana were directed by the media for their other former London school partner, Bethnal Green Academy.
The incident caused a huge wave of attention last year, as well as tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security records estimate that about 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria, including about 50 young women and girls.
A number of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home are a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for hundreds of dollars.
Great payload work you don't even need a high school for.
That's how it looks at the first look at the work of an anaconda.
And often the other one.
The benefit is not only extremely high wages in Czech terms (in Prague you will earn up to 180,000 Kč), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, nearly 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
Among the most sought, according to the staff agency Grafton are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
The candidates can choose between a few job offers.
The candidates do not therefore agree on the job position, but the job position on the candidates, comments Jitka Soukkova, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school is not necessary.
Higher education, then, is not necessary for foreigners.
Higher education means a good foundation and is the overall indicator of the intelligence and education of the candidate, but it often has little in common with the knowledge of development.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which once studied high school does not succeed, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
Mostly won in Prague.
Ajacs are moving high above the republican average.
For the most money they'll come to Prague and Brno, there's no such hit parade in the regions anymore.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Cuba confirms.
Technical directors will reach the highest cost.
In Prague and Brno they can reach 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, payment is lower, but it does not fall below 80,000 CZK.
Demands are also IT project managers.
They can earn 60,000 to 100,000 CZK.
The fight is about the graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the office of work, they don't pay for it.
So if I move in and transfer an expert from another company, they like to go after the graduate.
They can raise him according to their own.
They won't escape without their tongue.
The knowledge of a foreign language is appropriate in every profession, but there is a need for a minimally decent English.
The knowledge of at least one foreign language is necessary in some IT positions.
On the other hand, we meet with a number of cases where companies are looking for a highly educated and experienced person in particular and are satisfied with only the average English knowledge.
However, if, for example, a support worker has more foreign words, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, the director of Cuba will deliver.
Yoo in Google, there's a paradise.
It's easy to envy the Czech employees in Google.
Of course, it is a flexible working time for them, the possibility of working from home or different short notices, not just for mothers.
"The newly sealed fathers provide the company with four weeks of vacation extra after the birth of a child," says Martina Joneková, Google spokesman.
Hiccupation also carries health care for employees and family, feeding, transportation, training, wellness or massage directly at the workplace.
Whoever wants to learn has green and doesn't depend on what new one wants to learn.
But that doesn't end the benefits.
Such a full refrigerator for free is certainly not to be put in place.
A healthy lunch (in some places and breakfasts and dinners) is available on site every day.
In addition, in all offices there are so-called microwaves, where people always find a healthy kitchen, the speaker shows.
And so nothing has to be discarded, so as it does, it goes into a box that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these inconvenient benefits in Czech?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"For Google, it is not important for employees to sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, movement or development, ideas and innovative solutions," the speaker added.
The United Nations strongly criticised Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria of systematically violating the human rights of refugees.
The Bulgarian government's official strategy "is causing serious concern about Bulgaria's failure to respect international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussain warned in a statement.
He noted that "it is particularly disturbing to be a witness of how important and influential public personalities express support for criminal armed fighters, who are the doorkeepers of refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who move to Bulgarian territory are automatically arrested," Zeid stressed.
What is worse is that they are often held guilty and imprisoned for a year or longer, if they try to leave the land.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right, under international law, to leave any country, including his own.
Bulgaria held 14 000 migrants this year, last year for the same period of 21,000.
Pokémon Go - Honba for health and happiness that will be paid
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
During the last decade, many people complain that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer spending free time in front of the screens.
Pokémon brings people out of the band and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens was originally lost on television, later on video games and more recently on smart phones.
It's great to see that technology and activities outside are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I'm talking about fashion, which is Pokémon Go, application based on items that first appeared in video games at the end of the 1990s (later created a drawn series, playing cards, etc.).
As with many cultural phenomena, this new game has been introduced in the beginning of July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand to a decline in interest.
The introduction in other countries was then postponed because of the potential interest that led to server overload.
Pokémon Go got more users over several days than Tinder and almost as many users as he has Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players on the smart phone go out looking for the Pokémons who follow them using GPS, and when they find them, they can "take them out" (through the screenshot on the phone) or "get them".
Manie praised the generation who played the game at a younger age, brought her out of the seat and woman out looking for Pokémony.
In the United States, this game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps that "average" people make every day.
The Cardiogram application for smart hours from Apple, who is tracking 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the game being released, the number of people who have been practicing every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who Pokémon is playing him - it sees only rough data about level exercises.
Many public campaigns aimed at "finding 30", "getting up from the couch" and "being active every day" fell on an unpopular basis, because most public-health messages are boring and targeted by people who do not look good.
However, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who practice regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we cannot give here.
But the beauty of the game Pokémon is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover three health pillars - movement, fresh air and sun peppers.
Some people even get new friends when they're horrified.
As it is, of course, they will find such boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can come in the door.
What about, like?
It's a breakthrough.
At their time applications for smart phones, like Fitbit, were able to monitor our activity, but they didn't give us any reason to do something like this game.
The news is looking at and the interest in it is beginning to fall at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémons, there will be other games that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people in the pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles won gold in the multi-fighting gymnast of women
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump.
Without the stains on the shed.
They've all gone to the simples.
Excellent at all.
And now finally the Olympic champion.
The 90-year-old American gymnast went straight on Thursday with a title in a multi-fight and the others on the full line under the Olympic reflectors.
The overall result 62,198 clearly confirmed its advance to the silver medalist and member of the "final five" team Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliy Mustafin.
Simone Bilesová (USA) on Thursday during the event at the camp in the finals of several players in the sports gymnast at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in brazilian Rio de Janeiro.
Biles became the fourth American in a series that won the win over, and the fifth overall, when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps even the best.
When her overall final assessment was on the table and her long journey to this point ended, she was shown face-to-face.
This success results in the same league of single athletes of their time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles' sport has dominated for the last three years, won 15 medals in world championships - including 10 gold. Her fascinating compositions are a mix of ambitions and accuracy and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton marked her as "the best gymnast she'd ever seen."
The final test was waiting for her in Brazil, not so between Billes and the rest of the race, but between her own and the burden of too great expectations.
Anything other than returning home to your family in Spring, Texas, with a hand full of gold medals, would be considered a disappointment.
Simone Bilesová (USA), left, and Aly Raisman are encapsulated after winning gold and silver medals in the finals of the women's multi-faceted singles at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was as a janitor in the famous national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked forward to her long journey to the summit, which is not entirely true.
Part of her composition in the simples - the one that contains her typical three-storey salt with a double turn - is planted in Latin music, which would have just been thrown home, into the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her cousins as battalions and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman's way to the gym where Boorman was training and where he gained strength.
The competition has not won since 2013 - this is the result of a victory that can continue as long as Biles will want.
Even though Mustafin took a short lead on two islands, it was just an illusion.
Kladina and the simple - where Billes defends the world championship - wait.
She got back to the front with 15,433 points behind the floor - and ended with 15,933 points in the free.
Raisman gently hugged her when she was waiting for the final score - just formality - and around three-thirds of the red, white, and blue shadows Biles came out of tears when the wish that she had ever written in her diary was fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was so little payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared the third line with Mustafin, then bronze for her three best compositions.
This time a twenty-two-year-old captain of the team, who the Americans call "a grandmother", was quite ahead.
After her simples, she sent a gift of air kisses, and she was given back, which sometimes seemed to be inextricable.
For Biles, this nine-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where he became a complete hit, a whole new point:
Police: Three victims in the case of a serial killer shot while listening to music in the car
According to the police report published on Thursday, two women and a girl died at the age of 12 during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and the daughter of Ellis Maleah were shot on 12 June in a car parked on the way.
The report states that the armed man stood on the side of the driver and fired eight wounds from the handgun. Then he ran into another vehicle.
According to the police, they don't stand for a triple murder robbery because the attacker didn't take the money, nor the $2,900 that one of his adult victims had.
Speaking police in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the investigators were investigating whether the shooting had any connection with any of the previous four attacks.
In two mostly Spanish quarters, nine attacks were reported in four months, with seven people being killed and two others being injured.
"It's happening in the villa neighborhood in front of the houses," Howard said earlier this month for the KHO branch of the CBS station.
Police believe that the suspect used several cars, including Nissan's lamb at the end of the 1990s, the black BMW at the end of the 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to explain what evidence led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was transferred to a hospital where she later suffered from her injury.
Linear (31) and the daughter of Ellis Maleah died on the spot.
A police witness said it wasn't unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which became the target of an empty delivery only half an hour before a triple murder, and the police believe its origin was this serial killer.
The investigators found the cartridges and made a bullet from the rest of the balls in the seat and from underneath the engine caps.
The mother of a six-year-old child with a microcephalus: "His condition is improving"
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves songs, toys, and of course also his mother.
But unlike her peers, she suffers microcephalus, which is the result of a genetic disorder that her mother, Elizabeth Picciutová, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I thought I couldn't handle this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are preparing for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, learned that Edmund might never be known and that he might not survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the institution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people didn't do this anymore," explains Picciut.
Edmund's walking with a walker.
He shouldn't sit down until he's three years old, and he's still not talking.
Some barriers are already filling slowly.
She comes with help and she rides a bike.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth plays the sign language through which Edmund says, "Please sing to me."
"We're teaching him the sign word," said Picciutová for CBS News.
But it's not the usual sign word - says Edmund invented some sign himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different states: genetics, such as Edmund, and post-infectious viruses caused by pregnancy, such as sleepers or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It's too soon to be able to tell us how the Zika virus will affect the lives of the infected.
Picciut recalls the emotional tax he chooses for the future.
I keep asking myself, "What's going to happen?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I've never wondered what a total prediction is, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
Picciutová, however, has an encouraging report for mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by Zika.
The situation is getting better.
You know it's gonna be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods have requested rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
A strong rain and extensive floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. Another rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) reported that after extreme flooding, a number of rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and southern Mississippi will flow from their shores and threaten extensive flooding.
Governor Louisiana John Bel Edwards said state officials are constantly in contact with local authorities and help is already on their way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesperson of the Governor for National Security and Preparedness for the Crisis Situation, said they were receiving requests for vehicles to drive in water, boat and sand.
Steele said that only the Tangipahoea district asked for ten thousand pints of sand.
The flood guards will remain in most of the southern Louisianas working on Saturday.
The Meteorological Service stated in the declaration that it can charge more than 8 to 13 centimeters above the sea.
In southern Alabama, there was a flood guard on Friday, when rains continued in the area of the city of Mobile.
According to predictions, the Committees at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs have the weekend to culminate.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that both said they could flood a number of homes in the indigenous areas of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that there is a danger of flooding after a current in the Ascension County, when these diluted streams will flow to Lake Maurepas only slowly.
The Tickfaw River, something souther than the Mississippi state border in Louisiana, reached the highest recorded level at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
Rescuers are still raising people from the coastal waters of Amite and Wilkinson in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his own son were already among the Gloster survivors on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 metres from his home, rose rapidly over the night.
He said he was alerted by his next non-owning son who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was getting closer," Hansford said.
We had it up to the belt.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all his family are injured and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford stated that crisis workers saved all three huge military-style freight vehicles and took them to a fire station in Gloster, where they stayed hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of the rainy rains, the floods “broadcast” and the authorities consider evacuation.
According to Krautmann, the observer near Livinston announced that the rains dropped 35 centimeters [35 cm] from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the ground was very busy from mid to mid to mid.
The authorities indicated that the efficient rain and paid roads had requested the rescue of residents from their homes during the period of Tangipahoe and the abolition of education in five school districts.
The WWL branch at CBS announced that 200 homes had been flooded, according to Tangipaho's elders.
The residents were evacuated into two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The mayor of Robby Miller stated that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that had been trapped by high water.
In the village of Amit and in the city of Hammond there were shelters for those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the county of Tangipahoa in Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to the flood, and the locals were provided with sand cans that could be picked up and tried to protect their homes and businesses from the water.
"The last major floods we had here in March," said the city manager of Lacy Landrum.
Looks like these floods are gonna be similar.
Rupert Lacy, the crisis manager in Harrison County, Mississippi, stated that on the coast of the Persian Gulf, a persistent rain continued.
He said that a few homes were closed on Thursday, but on Friday none of them showed up in the report.
Keith Townson, leader of the Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot in the face", survived a shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, a sixth boy was shot in Philadelphia, and this week a second shooting at a child at 6 years of age in the city.
Her child's parents for CBS Philadelphia identified her as Mahaje Brown.
The parents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including weakness, legs, pains and stomachs, but he was aware of it when he was transported to the hospital.
"He grasped the tremendous power, his small body was assimilated as the solution," said his grandmother, Delores Melendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family at the station said the boy should get well.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three more men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-olds is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia there are two other victims in stabilised condition.
According to the report, a child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle with a 90-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are checking if any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
The investigators at the CBS Philadelphia indicated that there was likely a shooter between several armed men.
The site was equipped with weapons of a type of attack, a number of weapons of attack.
According to everything, it was definitely a continuing battle.
On the street there were trailers on both sides of the road.
It seems, then, that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved here," the captain of the Philadelphia police station, Anthony Ginaldi, told the station.
Several homes and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No one's been detained, and the police are allegedly investigating video recordings from the camera.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot into a wildly shot in front of a house in the vicinity of West Oak Lane on Tuesday.
The girl's back, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's how I imagine a female gymnastic team for this year's Olympics, right for a few reasons.
First of all, I've been to every summer Olympic since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, in this team are three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which complements Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also confirmed the presence of blacks and Latin Americans on the tip of this sport.
The gymnast number one in the past four years was African-American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second points last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals was surprised to become a champion of the Olympics and America was riding.
Now the world could testify to the incredible performance of the three-dimensional world winners Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterly gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in a woman’s more individual battle.
And team member Aly Raisman won the silver.
We're witnesses to the sports peak, but it doesn't look that way in high school hours in the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie graduated from the Olympic team the same way as Aly and Madison.
They are "final five", because the team will only consist of four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi is training.
However, the fact is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastics clubs that keep parents paying for training, equipment, travel, clothes, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their creditors and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs the gymnasiums have all the training and for the gymnasiums and gymnasium families are a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started high school.
It is our duty to bring gymnastic training that is more accessible and accessible to the countless young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired.
I set up a gymnasium fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or with low costs in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (especially black and Spanish origin) and we trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnasts to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and get out of this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and mind decision.
This combination means life benefits for good health, success in school and work.
The inspiration of this team will send thousands of young girls to us who want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for proving "wonderful force" and for winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all reasons to become on the road with healthy, strong and successful young women.
Following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter other states
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would end the disagreement on changes, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the election rejected the agreement.
Hunt discovered plans to get out of the contract in July with NHS being in "no one's land" and further delays would have a harmful impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work procedures with a view to improving care in non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, president of the BMA Committee on Young Doctors last night stated: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contracts, especially in the sense that the current labour crisis will increase and therefore the fair treatment of all doctors.”
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes into a new contract, progress is needed and time is coming.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through the negotiation have met with eagerness to engage Dr and often with a defunct silence by the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this possibility is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for expulsion and solve the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last season at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, as sisters and specialists were invited to attend doctors who were among the protestors.
Ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the recast contract, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would conclude disagreements with regard to changes.
BMA wants higher pay for work on the weekend for 54 000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the president of the NHS employees, called on young doctors not to enter any positions.
Mortimer said: “The field action will only achieve little or nothing, but will put pressure on the already overloaded teams and services and will increase anxiety, exhaustion and disruption for patients, treating staff and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have dealt with the advice of young doctors and with the Ministry of Health and have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervisor and informant.
Employers hoped that the continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as stress, flexibility in education, further training for those returning after career interruptions, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study freedom and gender differences - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health take agreements that were reached with BMA in November, February and May.
The medicine for 60 crowns per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a medicine that is estimated to be around 60 crowns (two books).
The medicine against blood clotting Ticagrelor reduces the risk of reinfection in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now administered for 12 months after the heart attack to reduce the risk of death or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people will suffer from heart attack each year, and a quarter of them will experience another arrest or heart attack.
Infarct and morticaria are caused by the accumulation of fat that forms a related layer on the walls of the artery.
If this level is severed, blood clots, blood clots, and heart attack may occur.
If the wound is released, the blood clot can continue, block the blood supply into the brain, and cause the brain to die.
People who have already had a heart attack are exposed to a higher risk of another seizure.
ticagrelor, which manufactures the British company AstraZeneca and which is sold under the commercial name Brilique, reduces the risk of being less likely to cause contaminants.
It is recommended that patients receive 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “In spite of the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who have another heart arrest or death - often with devastating consequences.”
The fear of repetition may have a significant negative effect on the quality of the patient’s life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart arrests and death in people who have already experienced a heart attack.
It is our pleasure to see that in the preliminary recommendation to Ticagrelor, we can extend the possibilities of treatment that are available to thousands of people who will be able to take it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially about the risk of bleeding - is limited over the three-year period, it is not recommended in the proposal for treatment over this period.
With computer culture, frauds in Muslim areas began to flourish
The mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year for corruption, which was linked to the government's report.
The culture of political justice has led to an examination of the widespread frauds in Muslim communities, as reported in the government report today.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticises the police, election inspectors and counsellors for ignoring the abuse of the will for "responsibility to ethnicity and religion."
A former community secretary, now a leader of anti-corruption attacks, said that threatening the wills on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should protect the cordon from the polling stations and the convicted voters.
He recommended that the voters take the ID with them and be able to prove who they are in the elections.
At present, the electorate will only enter its name and address.
The report further proposes that people should make an unmistakable ink on their fingers when the vote is delivered so that they can be prevented from being elected twice.
Whistleblowers should have greater protection, says Pickles.
It calls for greater access to the documents from the meeting and for decisions taken by the informal committees or working groups.
"It is only a matter of protecting against electoral fraud, but also of protecting local government against the wider corrupt environment and financial frauds that go hand in hand with it," he said.
The report requested Downing Street as a result of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets in western London.
Last year, the special electoral court decided that the mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after charges of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "cynically attacked" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his criticism of the accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, according to his words, "led his campaign in such a way that it was the duty of the devoted Muslims to vote for it."
Up to 300 votes were questioned or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and betrays himself to someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud in the corresponding vote - which it is claimed that the senior members of the Muslim community during it have put pressure on people to vote for the candidates they have chosen.
Sir Eric, on the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean the electoral system, including presentation of ID
His report states: “Provided evidence was presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were under pressure to vote in accordance with the will of the elders, and above all in communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
"The concerns were raised that... the state institutions had made eye contact with such behaviour because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric presented 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including for political activists to be forbidden from manipulating with a corresponding vote and thus preventing the "voice performance."
The report, which is now being evaluated by Theresa May, also asks for more detailed checks on registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and dose fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking the voters to submit an ID before the vote.
Using an unscrupulous fingerprint on people's fingers when voting to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Systematic checks of the nationality of persons shall be carried out in order to ensure that they are able to vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence shall be limited to three years.
To prevent political agitators and activists from manipulated with surrendered correspondence voices and electoral envelopes.
To give the police permission to create around the polling stations of the cordon.
To amend the laws to make it easier for persons who are developing an illegal burden under the 1983 Reform Act.
Ban the posting of photos in the polling rooms.
Require only English (except Wales) to work in the polling stations.
Encouraging training and ensuring that employees comply with the rule that voters go to the polling stations individually.
Sir Eric criticises the London police and says it's "surprising", that after the Tower Hamlets case, no criminal charges were filed.
"The Court of Justice ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for litany corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty over the scope of the reasoned doubts - in force of evidence of a criminal offence.
It also criticises the inconsistency of "control of shrinking lenses" in the department for the registration of volunteers at the council.
Sir Eric said: “The fate of the court in the case of Tower Hamlets by awakening.
Our nation has a proud link to parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden proliferation of electoral frauds and the refusal of some authorities threatens this reputation.
Fascinating the Cyclical Bishop of Kate and other well-known personalities on the Olympics in Rio
The fans of the 2016 Olympics went crazy this week to the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is apparently like the Duke of Cambridge.
But the four-year-old Olympic is not far from the only athlete who is trying to make a gold year, which can be praised by his own twin of a number of well-known personalities - at least not according to social networks.
At the celebration of the Olympics in Rio and all the well-known personalities that currently appear on our screens, the FEMAIL column for women has drawn up a list of the Olympics that are more than remotely similar to the Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunted animal: A member of the American team of firefighters, Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonardo DiCapri
Next to Kate's double on the cycling route, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain firefighter could be a twin of Leonardo DiCapria's star.
A champion of Brady Ellison's U.S. firefighters caused a storm on Twitter after his images were invented on which he was supposed to look like a Wall Street wolf.
Brady noticed the media madness himself and admitted that he was hearing from a little girl about his similarities with Lee.
"There's no such thing as a big deal, except for the cows," said Brady for the Huffington Post.
"He's a guy and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted this year even more: the imaginary image between the British jump to far away Greg Rutherford and the favorite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast, Aliye Mustafin, with her big, prominent eyes, was said to be a copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the Gel Matthew Morrison series for several years.
And for change: The user thinks that Nathan is a "athletic version" actor from the film Home (Inception)
Another long-standing comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Nadala and the actors Josh Hartnett, who have similarly dense eyes and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimo's proud not only eat the flesh and blonde hair like Annalynne McCord's. And about Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, fans say it looks like "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Important women: Hope Sol (left) football lion and Dexter Jennifer Carpenter series (right) have a similar shape of face and eyes
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased that the similarities were also observed
On waves theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a similar view of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed his satisfaction at the fact that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical."
The Hope Sol football star and the actress of the Dexter Jennifer Carpenter series have a truly incredible face and eye shape.
Among other favorite comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical with the smile of the actress Laura Linney, or the holder of gold medals for Gaby Douglas gymnastics, proud of her beautiful wide smile, which would copy the smile of Gabrielle Union, the stars of the movie Bravo, girls!
The CBC station's Olympics comment apologized for saying about the Chinese swimming pool that "blow"
Mid-term live transfer from the Olympics to the CBC station led to the selection of the performance of fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan by Byron MacDonald. The swimming pool ended in the fourth place of women's race at 4x200 m staff free style
The Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "stumbled like a smell" and "breathing".
Commentary Byron MacDonald felt that his microphone was turned off when at the end of the finals of the women's staff at 4x200 meters free style began to shake his own opinions.
MacDonald, who had the CBC's comments team to bring "resurrection," said, among other things, "This little 14-year-old from China gave it up, you fool."
Too much excitement, she smelled like a smell, she blew up.
Thank you.
Chinese sailor Ai Yanhan (14) sailed the second bar in the race at 1:57.79 - at 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and enabled Canadians to reach China.
The viewers in Canada began to quickly invite online and were frightened by the tone and language that the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "Did the speaker tell the CBC that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "blow"????
The idiot didn't notice he's still on the show."
Ai Yanhan from China at the finals of the women's staff race at 4x200 meters free-style was described as: "This little 14-year-old from China gave it up, you fool."
Critics Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his withdrawal
When Twitter users learned how tender Byron MacDonald is, they didn't hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a gang of racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was hosting CBC, apologized for the live comment MacDonald, and said: "We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimmer who has escaped the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
The CBC station finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Co-rapporteur Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonalda
CBC then copied and filed their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about the comments made by MacDonald
The station also apologized and made a statement.
She's sincerely sorry that the word was pronounced, she shouldn't get to the ether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers in the broadcast and to those who watch us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimming pool, not the swimming pool itself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized for his live broadcast and tried to explain his note by saying he didn't want to sound like a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's workshop," he said in a broadcast from the Olympics at the CBC station.
"I had in mind the performance of the swimmer and not the person of the swimmer as such."
"There's no need to say that I didn't mean any offense and I'm very sorry."
Customers in Primark are abused by a woman who has tried underage laundry in the middle of the store
When the woman went out to try her pants in the middle of Primark’s sales area, they were not sure what to look at.
To make it even worse, she tried how her size fell, took her pants off and returned them back to the regiment.
She continued in the search and finally tried four pairs of pants in the shop in Bouverie Place shopping center in Flokeston.
Primark shop in Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where a woman tried her pants before returning to the store
Jenny Davidson’s mother, who was in the shop at the time, said that after testing the underwear, a mysterious woman “dressed again and went out of the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe in their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her pants off, took her own pants off, and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she just stood there, squeaking like monkeys."
"Everyone just watched her dress up again, and obviously she didn't like it because she got back to the regula."
She did the same with three others before finally decided she didn't like anything, got dressed again and left.
"It seemed that she didn't mind who she was looking at - nor that she would think of the man who would have to buy the pants she tried."
Ms. Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: “This idea is that someone will take home the pants that someone had on himself and nobody cleaned them. It’s disgusting.”
It happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I picked up the things she had obviously tried to get them out of the sale – which is also the only right thing.”
"I'm afraid I'm going to bring home a new coat and find out that she had another woman on her side, took them off and that they weren't dressed."
Primark spokesperson said: "Prmark knows about the incident that occurred in our trade in Folkestone on Tuesday, 9 August."
All the products concerned were downloaded from the sale.
How to Combat the Arms Attack by Krav Maga
The world out there is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com it could be safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, the state-owned Krav Magic Federation in New York, to find out how to deal with armed thieves near the distance.
This video will show you how all of a sudden you get over the rapist, whether he's getting close to you in front or behind.
If you're getting close to the back, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "have a free shot".
Then you will grasp a weapon between your fronts and your shoulders just before you hit it in the face with a loose bow.
Then he follows his knee to the weak, and while the attacker turns in pain, you shoot his weapon out of his hand, hit his head in the face, and start to step back, and you hold the weapon aimed at him.
If a armed man approaches you in front of you, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the fire line, grab a gun and shoot it so the dealer can't shoot.
At the same time, put the weapon into the force and strike the attacker into the chest, then shoot the weapon out of his swing and start to step back, while still at peace with him.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video where you'll see exactly how Misrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get out of the fall - if you are not the great Krav Maga - is to spend all the money.
Traveler Ian Wright olyzes the most spicy places in Europe to travel guide
The British traveler decided to undergo a difficult test of his immune system and a david reflex - olysing the most repulsive and unpleasant places in Europe.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, for proof of the strength of his immune system, surrounded the euro banknote with his tongue on Piccadilly Circus, the button was placed on the train's toilet and the Russian public phone.
He used a flashlight to show himself and all of us what he's allowed to do.
The experiment, based on which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the switch button on the train used by thousands of other people may seem completely repulsive, but the need for a kitchen sink is actually much more harmful bacteria.
Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals throughout his journey throughout Europe about strengthening the bacteria of the wheat florie and his own health.
Luckily, none of what he smelled left anything worse in his mouth than his taste.
Ian Wright celebrated himself by testing his gut resistance on his way around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system completely safely - from public landings at train stations after the crash
In his film, he said: “I haven’t had much to do with my health since I was a child, and I have given myself everything I can, from the clay after eating worms and boiled water.”
In the film, his reputation as a drug addict confirmed.
The only thing he refused was the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple beam, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but the lipstick refused after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producers Valio filmed the travelers' film entitled The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
In the film, he said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever felt in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than this!
I won't be able to smell anything because it's disgusting here.
Film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was staged in collaboration with the Finnish milk producer Valio.
Mr. Wright’s company provided Valio Gefilus, which contains milk acid and vitamins C and D, which help people strengthen the wheat bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for decorations, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow the occupation and at the same time enable us to explain the benefits of the probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea "Let's call Ian."
It is said that interest in the health of cereals is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about producers, we wanted to put them in broader contexts - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of stomach health and how it is connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy cereals is a global phenomenon, and through this document we have provided consumers with interesting information.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's say this, Ian would lose my respect if he smelled some of what I wanted him to do - like the nasty Russian toilet that appears in the film."
Some things were naturally easier for Ian, others rather difficult.
I'm glad we made some of those dirty things.
Valio carried out a study in 2015 whereby 84% of respondents combined their lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and stomach health and 58% of respondents indicated that at least occasionally they were using products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
The family socially needed before moving destroyed the public building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of the socially needed left the damage to their general home of 50,000 pounds after they had been accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were displaced from home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long number of complaints against them.
After their violent move from the house, apartment officials were shocked when they found that the property was in an accident condition.
There were holes in the vaults, the floor covering was torn down, the floors fell on the floor, and the walls were covered.
The family has already moved away and is considered to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing in Cornwall Houseing, said she was worried about saving the house.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, as this property is likely to be known as “not as good as part” of Cornwall.
This family is not well known and their names are not well known.
Couples have three sons who sometimes lived in the house, and the police have stated that the horrors of the family were street fights using baseball bats, threatening the surrounding population, using drugs, distribution of drugs and loud screams, quarrels and slogans.
Skeldon (47) whose name was mentioned in the rental contract was sentenced to anti-social behaviour in June.
In a few rooms in the house, which may have been torn down, they found incandescent waste.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was removed
Neighbors say they saw them on the street as they prowled, and people regularly called the police here
Cornwall Houseing and her partner forced her to move out of the house this week after they had received an additional 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The neighbor who got away welcomed the move by their lives being a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone at all."
We lived next door for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, they can't count at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the supervisor of Cornwall Housing, stated that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly called to the house
Waste and old toys fell into the upper part of the general house
She adds: “It is a shame that the tenants failed to take responsibility for their own conduct and for the conduct of their families.
It was a very difficult case, because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, Devon and Cornwall police and local community members who have been firmly informed.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time bring the message that we will not tolerate sexual behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the tenants who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
The contaminated mattress, which remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after moving
Workers will now have to remove a pile of waste left around the house
In 2014, she carried out police in the house of ragia and found more than 70 grams of rope, weight, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was punished when she was found guilty of holding Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was designed on the basis of a home for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner are now living in private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they'll try to move tenants who violate the rules of their leases
Angela Crowová of the Denov and Cornwall police stated that the move was a clear message for other tenants who would continue to violate the rules.
"This is a message for all those who think they can behave impartially, and for those who would like to follow such conduct," she said.
The police of Denov and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and non-social behaviour and will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after a low crossing of a military trisk plane over the beach
Tourists enjoying the sunflowers in Portugal's Aveir were terrified of death
Portuguese military aircraft P-3C Orion flew to incredibly low
Military aircraft declared that it was a practical flight and claimed that there was no danger of safety
At a time when a low - flying treacle climbed over the crowded beach, frightened tourists panicked.
On dramatic images it is seen how the military aircraft reaches almost to the distance of the sun to the sandy beaches near the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to wonder after they were disturbed by the noise of the engine of a three - plane plane without seeing what was coming out of the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several recruits who published video recordings of the dramatic overrun on social networks, said: “The plane has been really low twice, and at one point it seemed to be going off.”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I was surfing, and I really thought the plane would fall on my head.”
Tourists on the Aveir Beach were terrified when a plane flying low emerged from the darkness
The Portuguese military aircraft today declared that the pilot P-3C Orion was on the exercise flight to identify the fishing vessels on the coast and had to move low because it was the only way to check the ships.
The plane reportedly flew about something less than usual because of the poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the aircraft claims that the safety of the people was not threatened.
This summer's forest fires destroyed part of the mainland of Portugal and requested four victims to live on the island of Madeira.
Portuguese military aircraft today declared that the pilot had to fly low due to dense noise and smoke from fires that prevented him from seeing
The pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels during the training.
Half of funeral services do not comply with the rules.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspectorate (CIOI) found this in the second quarter of the year.
According to it, funeral services do not most often inform others of their prices or do not issue written confirmations of the acceptance of the order.
CHOI has placed 41 bribes in the total value of 73,000 crowns.
Today, her spokesman Jiří Fröhlich was informed.
The inspectors found a doubt in 47 out of 95 checks.
In addition to non-informed prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at other prices than agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not duly labelled and once the seller used an officially uncertified measure.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 crowns.
These were packages for urns, candle covers and binders that were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"Because in this specific area of services there is still a violation of the law, control actions will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
The London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
It was announced that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who had been sent from London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
Legal representative Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned about her death in the Syrian Rakce a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that she was probably killed during a Russian flight attack in Rakce, which is the property of a group in the country.
Sultani was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died at the time she was preparing to flee the war - torn country and return to Britain.
"People want to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing -- as a message and a warning to others -- is that these are real dangers associated with the road to the war zone -- is that they're making people from when they make decisions," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolchildren from eastern London entered the plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then to the bus to the border with Syria.
Sultana’s family learned that she had married an IS warrior in Syria - and had been widowed for several months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, he leaves Garland as the candidate of the Supreme Court.
Leader of the Senate on the democratic side of Harry Reid says he is convinced that the candidate for presidential elections for the Democrats Hillary Clinton appoints Judge Merrick Garland to the highest court in the case of his election.
The Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama nominated it in March.
The Senate leader, Mitch McConnel, says that the person who replaces the late judge of the Supreme Court will elect the future president.
Reid announced on Thursday during a conference call that he believed Clinton would choose Garland "with certain degree of credibility."
Reid's speaker later stated that he didn't talk directly to Clinton about whether Garland would name and just speculate.
He evaluated Garland and said the Clinton team wouldn't want to "spoil the ship" by choosing someone else.
Garland is president of the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Reid said that the republics that block Garland's nominations are "obligators" and "pokok" of the Republican candidate to the Presidential Office of Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't getting into the office.
According to the magazine Treatments, our calendars are for "women and men"
The magazine Treats works closely with photographer David Bellemer to issue a calendar for 2017, inspired by Pirelli's 70-year-old calendar.
But instead of the well-known personalities you are trying to find another generation top models for your 2017 NU Must.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine was full of trouble from Playboy from the old school because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing it for women.
He obviously thinks the calendar too.
"We must return to the display of overtime and classic tensions, when women and men are pleasantly felt and let themselves be inspired by the photos of the woman's body," Shaw said in a press release to the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or personally during open competitions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl direct: who really buys the gramofo boards?
Vinyl loves the isolation of a middle-aged man.
Before you decide to pay a section of comments with censored notes under the pseudonym NeAllOsmélíPeopleIn the Middle Ages, we state that this statement comes from real data.
According to YouGov, so much discussion about the rise of gramophone boards is associated not with the boom of millennials who want to love the original property of the physical object, but with the nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are the most likely people between 45 and 54 years of age.
Young people 18-24 are at least likely.
In fact, it is not even about the gathering of a excited fan - it is all about the emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone boards are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56%) versus 53%) and like themselves (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGo's true?
If this blog was broadcast as a television report, the camera would follow me as I go out into the dirty street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gesticulating widely. Then I would stop, pull out my hands and say something authoritarian, like, "Then let's look at it."
Let's take a look at that.
While Soho's heart slowly loses its charm and charm - buildings once occupied by independent sellers, hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, clothing and office needs - several fantastic specialty shops with gramophone desks have yet to be filled.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while. I'll get into the vicinity of different men in these shops and try to figure out what their age and emotional disposition is.
Stuart (55), a relative from Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (pockets: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (pockets: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has an afternoon meeting in London and is looking through the shops to fill a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about three or four thousand recordings.
All these recordings are tearing down the walls of his living room - on the picture above (the photo sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This huge amount of albums and singles also has thanks to the fact that they can afford it: they can now buy gramophone boards that they could not afford when they first came up, and they buy again what they sold in their youth and had no wind.
“Many of what I buy is from the end of the 60s and from the beginning of the 70s. These are things that would be issued when I was 11 or 12 then I was too small and couldn’t arrange them,” he says.
He agrees with the fact that those who buy recordings are probably introverts that they like themselves, and he adds: “I don’t smoke or drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works in Sister Ray, and he also thinks that a number of customers he meets are in the YouTube profile.
He also noticed a new flood of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt forced to buy their old phonograph records back.
According to my interviews, the people of their collections were most often released between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their gramophone records and bought a CD, now sell their CDs to buy their gramophone records back," he says.
That could explain the boom of lovers of gramophone covers of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of the gramophone decks?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find in a store like Phoenix that in a music store you will find a pleasant community of people with similar thoughts.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly damaged by the wireless payment system.
In the digital world, some favoritisms can feel paid and decided on the known environment of the envelopes of gramophones, things that bring memories of peaceful upbringing.
"I think that filling a gap or property of something material can bring some comfort," says Wez.
I'm a collector, I'm the same person, and I think a lot of people are.
It's an easy way to fill the place in your head.
"We are all like their social workers!" a collaborator is called from a bunch of gramophone boards.
The ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought their vinyl album a month ago had not heard it yet.
According to the survey, 41% of the surveyed gramophones that never use, while 7% of those who buy gramophones do not have a gramophone.
At this point in the report, he probably seemed really upset when he walked through the building of the compilation bossa nova.
The aspect of "trophy" and the recovery of interest is something Jonny (42), who works in the Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone recently came and said, "I don't have a phonograph yet, but I want to buy on the radiohead desk so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
The percentage is not big, but it's happening.
It's more about the product page than about music.
People come to us who say, "I don't have a phonograph."
These are the younger people, not the older, grown-ups who get into it.
Fopp, where at the present time almost one-thirty-one-thirty gramophone desks are replaced, has many different visitors on my arrival.
There's a couple of seventies, tourists who do photos, pubs and women in middle age.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as shops before - from the players with the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it's good to see different customers instead of the jazz.
None of them look particularly lonely, but you'll find it hard to guess when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) spends a few minutes at Fopp and searches various phonograph records in the download.
It's one of those who's looking at the exhibits more than they're going to lose.
According to his words, he doesn't make a lot of money, so he doesn't seem to think that he'd collect a record of the phonograph.
It's worth a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but the phonograph boards have their own magic... ," she sighs anxiously.
I can't explain - it's unique.
My last stop is a store that supposedly inspired a new generation of gramophone desk lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I look like I'm very excited about the girls in the gowns and I'm looking at a bunch of naked girls who're just hanging around Polaroid cameras, and then my father and daughter decide to buy Crosley's gramophone.
The left is the backyard whose walls cover the Gramophone Boards Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collections of Gramophone Boards.
No one's looking at them -- maybe because they're just for decorations and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's just a vinyl trick.
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the depth of Soho for the next, there is not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is probably more time and money than in other areas, is also where the most luxurious goods the vinyl is certainly.
But while my findings suggest that the results of YouGov are accurate - at least in shops with gramophone boards, they do not take into account a large number of collectors and vinyl lovers who actually exist in shops with gramophone boards and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or in offices.
He's certainly not going to spend the Thursday morning snooping after a shop with a phonograph desk on Berwick Street, going through recordings, and avoiding the sight of a strange, 30-year-old fake TV moderator, hiding behind the back of nothing indistinguishable middle-aged men.
Grönský skralok is the longest live storyteller - video report
According to scientists, the granite shark has the longest average life span of all the world's spindles.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the recording shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years and measures five meters
Court in France refused to pay off shops in the Jungle refugee camp
The court in France rejected the order of the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week of the Calais office, it was suggested that the state should be able to abolish a total of 72 provisional shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes after energy drinks, offer hair cuttings, and in provisional restaurants sell tea for 50 cents or basic bread for several euros.
The Office of the Prefect in Calais argued that places need to be destroyed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they mean a danger of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organisations have stated at the court that shops and restaurants are vital and that the food offered by the state-supported association and other groups does not provide an additional food for the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Disputed provisional shops and restaurants often provide shelters and free food to people in need.
The Court in Lille decided that there is no legal basis that would prevent people from operating 72 provisional trades, but stated that Prefect Calais's objections are "very understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants sell more than just food to people who "live in extremely desperate conditions."
He said that spaces provide peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that the Democrats threatened was a coffee shop in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, which is run by a non-profit organization that daily offers 200 meals, hours of English and French and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable people without joining the camp.
The petition for the protection of "children" cafes has signed more than 170,000 people.
The Guardian received a letter stating that the closure of the cafe “was a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.”
Charity organisations Help Refugee and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of refugees in the camp after the sharp increase in the coming years has grown to over 9,000 - which is still the highest throughout the entire period.
You thought he was dead.
The wolf crosses himself and the volleyball Ghost.
"From March I could normally train," he reported on the start of the summer preparation in full force.
What happened to you?
I had both lung embolism, and that's why I had heart problems.
Because when I was at the University of Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble caused the long flight to Asia?
I've had a stroke for two years, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me, nobody found me anything.
Then the blow came up.
There's a broken soul in the joint, it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when it hurts or changes the weather.
But nothing that would limit me is more aesthetic.
Were you worried about your life?
He did.
Last year, I didn't know I had any embolism at the tree tournament, and I couldn't move there anymore.
I spilled my blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different. I've been completely cured for five more days.
I actually thought I was dead, my girlfriend and family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you compare it?
I guess I had to live through it. Now it's just gonna go up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I need to be more careful when I fly.
But it can do anything.
Only when I wanted to go back to Prebram's preparation last year, there were still problems with the heart.
It's all right now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself for home to be able to play again.
I'll lock it up. I'm physically better at it than before.
What do you expect from Usty?
I'm glad the party looks good, most guys know.
I'm curious about two other foreigners coming in.
I hope we'll sit down with the people so it can fit us together.
You're gonna pick up the Uste?
There was a reputation for revelation, but every season is different.
Brno was eight years ago, now the second is over.
There's a new team in Usta, there's only a few players left.
It was the last one in extralysis, so there's a big room for improvement.
The way we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see who's gonna be the first rounds, maybe we won't.
Is Brom a guarantee of success?
He's already experienced and experienced it a lot, he'll think of a better place than the last place.
But my coming didn't depend on him, I agreed earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I'm a big friend with one of them, and it's been agreed that it's going to work here.
I'm not gonna say a name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for decades, he's an old good player.
Put us up.
What are you bringing?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like hectic, and I like to get an opportunity in not being such a good team.
I've been in Prebramy for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team right now, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger, in Ústí he is already training Australian Boehm.
What's it look like?
I know him under the circumstances, we played against ourselves at the university in the group.
And sometimes we had fun together, sometimes we sat together after the fight, so we met friends.
We beat them 3:1, right at the start of the summer preparation in Usta.
He's got a Slovenian girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
There's still American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze coming.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote with the American, it looks like a nice boy, a Brazilian who's going to know English.
Did you contact the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so the one who makes it, so I should communicate with everyone.
Right away, I found out what the players are, I found myself online, I saw some videos.
He's been doing a lot of good, he's a jumper, he's tall.
On Facebook we wrote a few messages, it seemed like a joke, it's going to come to us.
How do you feel about the recording unit position?
I didn't want to take anything else.
But I'm only going to be forty-four, and I don't care how it goes.
I'd rather be in the center of action. I'd rather lead the team than be led by someone else.
I guess I don't want to play anymore if I should be like the second recorder and dedicate myself to it for the full time.
How many times have you been single?
Half the time in Pribra, when it didn't go to Kusto as a captain, he got hurt, and then there were money problems, and he left.
Since then, we've been climbing up and I've been playing.
In Brno, the one I was a kidnapper, I had one and two.
A great year was in Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers, and I just chose Pribra.
That's where Budjejovice wanted me, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season for the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short headline remains the Phelps domain.
"To be back on stage winners and to hear the hymn is sweet as always," laughed Phelps and then again had eyes full of tears.
His fiancée and his mother were laughing again in the mirror, the son of Boomer this time slept quietly in his ears.
I'm living an inreal week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started racing, and in a few hours it'll be after all, he said touchy.
In the final after Phelps in two seconds, a silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino won a long run.
Bronz won Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from the last world championship.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (far) Michael Phelps is the third athlete who has the same discipline in four games behind him.
After most of the race, another American Ryan Locht and the household Thiago Perreira took the lead with Phelps.
While the gold miners in the final crusader's 50s planted a thin finisher, they fell outside the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand its unique medal collection.
Shortly after the flagship announcement, he went to the final race for 100 meters of motorcycles.
The legend could not be obscured even by the countryman Ryan Murphy, who won a double mark - after a hundred wins in Rio and a double track.
At the final, he left 37 sets of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, the third of which ended Russia's Jevgenij Rylov.
While Murphy's last world championship has only fifth of the doubles, he became a Marking King in Rio.
From the intellectual throne, Larkina, who had the same double success at the last world championship.
At the Olympics, he won the medals only now.
In the royal century, Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel were divided into gold.
For the sixteenth year of Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal in these games, for Manuel's second silver from the staff.
Blue gold won the OH as the first African American in history.
I believe I can be inspiring to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, sports will become love for them, and they will get to where I am, said Manuel.
Third, Sweden was Sarah Sjöström, who won a 100-metre motorcycle race in Rio in the world record and still has silver from the Kraularian dual.
By the end of the sixth world record, Australian Cate Campbell.
Japan's Rie Kanet won the Presařsk double, for which it was the first Olympic medal in the 1970s.
It has no precious metal or world championship, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Ruska Julija Jeffimov, who, due to the start of the game despite the doping past, is faced with the inviolability of spectators and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should still answer these questions.
I'm so tired of it, the Russian swimmer said.
The right to start in Rio failed until the special panel of sports arbitration CAS just before the start of the game.
They were getting busy calling me back, and I won.
If someone likes it or does not, or if he has another opinion to turn to the arbitral tribunal, she added.
Hermann: Unfortunately, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs lived on a special day.
Just a whole hour before the match, they found out who he was going to face.
They had to manage tactically.
And then, in a non-traditional time, the little shirt game number one started.
The first set didn't start well, then the opponent jumped, but at 19:19, they couldn't handle the final.
In the second, they were clearly better and comparable, but the decision-makers failed them.
In particular, a number of services shown meant losing 10:15 and playing with the Olympic tournament.
"We could defeat the Russians," said Hermann.
How would you assess the game?
Hermann: After the unfortunate start before I played, we got pretty into the game.
At the end of the last balloon, I got a receipt that I used to get used to.
We lost that set, which was key.
In the next set, we came up with an overview of the playground, another defense, and we pushed on the service.
In the tee-break, there was a terrible crash, and we were dressed up on this site.
It was a disappointment because we could defeat Russia.
Sluková: The damage to the beginning of the first set, we escaped there.
We were able to pull it down, but we missed the points.
The second set was great and decided service in the third.
We made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points, and it was about the five, and there was a lot of deception.
It's a shame because the Russians were playable.
How did you play on the little castle number one?
Sluková: Similar to in China in the adjacent courtyards.
The media and the atmosphere were different.
There was one hour at night, full silence, music playing, nothing.
It was a difference to the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponent an hour before the match?
Hermann: She was special.
We started practicing the game without knowing the anti-games, so we couldn't make a tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon (knock Nausch) caught the tactic on almost all the options that were there.
He had a lot of paper prepared with tactics, so we were pretty well prepared on this site.
Remember when you started the midnight game?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played in the 11th, but not in the 12th.
Blok Rusky Birlovova in the pre-play-off to OH in Rio.
Beach volleyballists Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in an envelope in the pre-play-off to OH in Rio.
Was it unpleasant?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in the group since ten, we had a regime moved before.
This was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has a sportsman who has to give his best performance in 12 hours.
But I think we've prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not quite typical, and it's probably not my favorite play time.
How do you evaluate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the process of the group was our goal, it's on one side okay, okay.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the fight.
Sluková: I'll sleep from it and from tomorrow I'll remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
The big brother is here, the first peaceful SIM is coming.
You're not avoiding her.
The new rules are intended to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who will decide to arrange a SIM for one of the local operators during their stay in Thailand.
So not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who work in Thailand, for example, or close their marriage there.
The Secretary-General of the Office of National Broadcasting and the Telecommunications Commission, Tatarn Tantasith, informed that there would be no exceptions.
The SIM sale plan for foreign nationals was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The new measures enabling the monitoring of their positions shall be adopted by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security, which enables the criminal activity to be handled by foreigners.
In addition, so-called tourist SIM should help to discover also persons who exceed the authorised length of stay.
In the case of sellers, a special SIM for foreigners should also appear on the side of the SIM specifically designated to the Thais.
The difference will be the function of monitoring, which will be permanently switched on in the cards of persons appointed without the Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This function at the SIM for Thai is not because you can always be easy to track," Tantasith added.
It must be added that in Thailand there are no subscriptions anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years one of the operators gave free launch to SIM tourists at airports.
They were so anonymous.
The introduction of the same measures as Thailand also considers ten telecommunication regulators from other Asian countries, such as Malaysia or Singapore.
They are also currently subject to mandatory SIM registration, but the legal use of the monitoring system is not possible.
However, the pending measures do not mean the obligation for a foreigner to arrange for entry into the country of the local operator’s SIM.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be brief.
Operators of the country concerned only know relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after applying the SIM to their network.
So they know the phone number, not the owner information.
However, the difference in roaming prices against the rates of local operators is so devastating that during their stay in Thailand, the majority of tourists start looking at local SIMs.
The efforts of the authorities to oversee the movement of foreigners have been legally criticized by foreigners living in Thailand.
The Tantasith situation calms down and, in relation to the protection of the privacy, the smart system compares to the obligation to provide a resident address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a judicial order if a particular person is to be monitored.
Any abuse of the system will be threatened by a more unspecified punishment.
"If the service provider follows the SIM position without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence," Tantasith added.
The system should also maximize the use of prepaid tickets.
While there is currently a recycling of a specific number until after the 90-day period after which the SIM is not registered, a new issue in the case of the release of Thailand could be renewed after fifteen days.
The luxury apartment in the new building on Vinohradech has a pool and a vertebrae on the terrace.
Why did you choose to live in a new building?
We've been looking for an old-fashioned apartment where most of the property care is owned by the manager.
The condition was that there were enough parking spaces and elevators in the house, which was essentially disqualifying the older building.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old homes, problems with floor swinging, high energy demands, and so on.
There were also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The entire interior for you was designed by architect Lenka Langer with his colleague Kamila Polákov from Artiga.
Why did you just call them?
Would you recommend working with an expert?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone if he proposed the apartment from the beginning, that is, it is a very complex technical process.
The second equation is the design of the interior itself: designers have a much better idea of the scale of possible materials and based on the customer's desire they are able to smooth the interior properly.
We worked with architect Lenko Langer on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of a personal recommendation from another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even when rebuilding our new apartment in Vinohradech.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a magnificent community-dwelling space with a suitable background for a four-member family, known as a modern but not a cold interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and realize intelligent household control.
And, of course, the quality of implementation had to be undermined.
Did you leave everything on the experts, or did you do it yourself in the final form of the interior?
All proposals, including technical drawings and samples of materials, were approved, but the proposal was always taken from the architects.
At first, we decided what we expected from the design, and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to include in the proposal, such as a blanket or an image.
I think that just our collection of mostly Czech authors including works by Karl Malich, Karl Vysušil, Václav Spály or Otto Gutfreunda the architect helped to guide us in our taste.
The combination of black, white and orange wood was also the idea of architects as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, carpets, textiles, art etc.
Did some complications occur when you realized that you had to give up your original ideas, or did you come to the new ones instead?
I hope only in the initial phase of the project when we came to the building at a time when it was first possible to rise to the height of our floor, and found that the prospects that we were planning were actually the shadow of the surrounding building.
Then we literally changed the dispositions overnight from base to base.
The spoon was used on the kitchen line and on the roof wall.
In the interior, the wooden surfaces are then dominated by the skin, such as the calving of Norma’s food and bar chairs from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make some changes or is there something you'd like to have today?
I'm saying it's a modern air interior, which is, above all, fulfilling its purpose.
We don't get any changes, most of the adjustments after the move took place in the level of shade and stay of the terrace.
I hope the only seal is on the floor, when the nut tree is shown to us as too polite in the home with the dog.
The word architect, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornyová, authors of the realization.
The apartment is in the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to make completely new available solutions and several other adjustments within the building.
The interior is an important element in the location of the lighthouses in the hall and the main toilet.
This gave us daylight into the darker space of the apartment.
The direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is also one of the construction adjustments that was very beneficial for the entire apartment function.
There's also a pool and a squirrel.
You're not negative compared to France, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are the origins of Algeria.
I was born in southern France, a piece from the Spanish border.
I've moved enough.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which led me to work in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I started to feel like I was breathing in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere between people.
I thought every Frenchman was very negative.
People in France are negative in general, but lately it has worsened.
That's interesting that you're referring to negativeism.
Some people like that value the Czech character.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to France.
Some people don't get that much when they come to France, because they don't feel that much like tourists.
But it was too much for me.
A big theme is money.
People feel that they have little money, but the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there's also a problem with people's behavior toward Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor began to look through his fingers just because I'm a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job, mostly anywhere else, and I hit a free spot with Air France here in Prague.
I admit I didn't even know from the beginning of Prague.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my dad even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now, and I'm not going to have to imagine that I wouldn't be here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't capture any negative reactions or hints, but I feel that people are more free here.
That I can do anything, get dressed, and no one's gonna judge me.
In France someone is still looking at you, especially when you have special clothes and something like that.
I started looking really free in Prague.
I don't think I'm interested in this kind of thing.
Where do you work now?
After working in Air France, I worked for one travel website.
Then another friend and I set up websites that people are offering and looking for shared housing.
We are still only working in Prague, but we would like to expand it throughout Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are Czechs from the middle, and two more Czech friends.
I have to say that another specific feature of the Czechs is that they're getting more distance from the beginning.
He won't let someone go to the body right now.
It's quite different from where I grew up.
Everyone in the south hugs and kisses the face.
This is different, but I understand it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is your language barrier a problem?
On the contrary, I have it quite simple in Prague, because everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evenings or in the food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have much time.
And by everyone having to communicate a little bit in English, I don't need to learn my language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, someone will come to my aid.
Have you met with any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Not really.
It may also be that I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
There's one experience that strikes me.
My leader, Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: They're not French, but Africans.
That really touched me.
But if someone had a problem with being a Muslim, I haven't had it yet.
And even though my colleague once pointed me at some anti-Muslim demonstration.
He told me not to go to the center, they're gonna put me in there.
The anti-Muslim demonstration is partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, today can happen anywhere.
I may not have been able to imagine that something like this would happen in France.
And it's not just Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect your faith?
It's very difficult.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow the reports of violence, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at Jiří's square from Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, the Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated themselves against violence.
Did you record it?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they have failed?
Do you meet with other Muslims in Prague?
For example, my colleagues are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have quite wild discussions about Islam, because we all see it a little different.
I'm from France, so I've been through another education, and they must have been studying Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinated status of a woman.
How do you feel?
I don't seem to be under any circumstances.
On the contrary.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It's related to not wearing any head coverings.
For example, hijab?
And it's signed in the way I was raised.
For example, my mom is a really good Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but she just doesn't wear a jacket.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on everyone how he interprets it.
When a person reads the Koran, he should have his own opinion on these things.
So when I read in the Qur'an a passage saying that God had told the Prophet to hide his wife from the others' sights, I said, "I am not the Prophet's wife. Why should I hide myself?"
On the other hand, I respect it, and when I get to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the cops demand it, I'll take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but it's great in Prague.
I'll even introduce myself to raising my own children here.
I think Prague is the ideal city for it.
The common Muslims and Christians demonstrated their opposition to violence.
Jachharko Kozelski Fenclow's wind in Rio hit the steppoints.
Five trips to the sea in the Brazilian Riu de Janiero were carried out by Czech yachter Veronica Kozelské Fenclové.
In the class, Laser Radial moved in front of the final two riders to the tenth place.
That would ensure Czech participation in the final ride.
You pick up the bags like a pack.
They want to compete with the transporters.
According to the idea of using already planned routes for the transport of the shipments, the TV director Matej Liška and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger is standing.
The idea was that life was inspired by three applications with a different geographical scope.
We released the National Transportation Application in May.
At this point there are thousands of cities recorded in it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic we want to learn this first, before we focus more on abroad, says in the conversation for iDNES.cz a 40-year-old manager.
How does the transfer application work, and which one of them can benefit?
You'll download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and the details of how big a package you can carry and how much you want to carry.
Someone needs to ask for transport again that day.
When the route and delivery time are appropriate, it will be saved and mutual notification will come.
In that moment, the chat will open, where the two of them will agree on the surrender.
How many people do you think should register to always find their own courier?
I don't know the ideal condition, I can't estimate how many registered and how many roads it takes to be completely optimal and every offer has been filled with demand.
It's already working on the main elevators, and it's logically easier than it's supposed to be on the road between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential of speed and accuracy.
People will still be confident and find that no one will run away with the package.
You didn't have to deal with that yet?
How many users have been in service two months after the release?
At the moment, we have between 5 and 6 thousand people who create roads.
We consider it a success and believe that they will pack up another.
Don't you think the sender's gonna be waiting too long?
We hope that we will be competing for large conglomerates only for the reason that we are able to deliver the thing we need to the same day and at the price break.
In large companies, you will pay a few thousand for delivery within two hours.
You'll have to pay a hundred or less here, because it's the way someone's already doing.
Should traditional transporters worry about possible customer accommodation in the future?
We hope so.
The market has a huge potential, a huge international transporter is fed here, just like a commercial chain, where everyone started to buy and gradually found that quality does not correspond to what they are paying for.
No one wants to find a ticket in the box with a message that the shipment is to be picked up on the sidewalk, and that's the first day after 19 o'clock.
At the time, I needed the package for six hours, and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't praise anyone and send out competition signals to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matej Liška (39).
No one ever acted in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as the music club manager, Matej Liška as a television director.
In 2014, the LTD Shippancee application was launched, which uses already planned routes between the world metropolises, especially the aircraft, to transport packages.
In 2015, they launched a project for the processing of a company that created the application for MAL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted three-quarters of the year and the application was put on the market in March 2016.
The transfer application began to develop in December last year and was released this year in May.
This is the local version of Shippancee managed for the Czech market.
The application Mesík and Mesík Profi have been developed since January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
From the beginning, it was intended to do all these applications that would one day connect in one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to put the application down and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The shared economy has been a topic lately, and this is an AirBnB or Ubera service.
Don't you have any concerns about the action in the area that no one can say so far, where is the boundary of sharing and where is the grey economy?
It's the same as another product.
It is clear to us that if it is successful and we are going up there, we will look further into the shadow of the economy.
But while someone saves and someone wins, it's not the intention to cover financial offices and tax controls.
Each user, either on the one hand or on the other, will be urged to pay his income if he does.
Why do you think the service has such a great potential?
The sender saves and the carrier earns, respectively, lowers the cost on the way.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
At the time of the social networks that people divide, we'd like this to be approached.
They can create nice stories, people are happy to help someone, and they'll tell themselves.
Maybe someone'll bring you the missing glasses, keys or pills.
People, according to me, have been missing personal access for a long time, and we say that this application is the service of people.
How, then, do you guarantee that the courier with the package doesn't drop?
Each user of the application together with the registration shall draw up a civil certificate and indicate a bank connection, a payment card or a credit card.
These are channels that give service and human credibility.
The couriers also collect stars based on the assessment of the transmitters.
We offer insurance, we still ship details.
An uninsured consignment in the event of loss or damage shall be handled by the courier, but shall not be held liable for the content in accordance with criminal law if it is illegal and does not know it.
If he is stopped by the police and found in a closed package in his bag of autopal or ten kilos of hash, the criminal liability is passed on to the consignor.
Does the abuse of sensitive data from the database pose any danger?
They are registered where necessary by the investigating administrative authority, which as the only one will have the opportunity to look into it, and we ourselves are unable to see them, data are protected against abuse.
How much money will the courier get after a successful delivery?
The buyer will determine the price and get the full amount he will say.
The distributors are charged a few percent more to facilitate contact.
This money is our profit, but it's just a few percent, because we want to push the volume.
The courier can't even charge that he didn't deliver the shipment when he actually delivered it, took it and delivered it is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or contents of the package?
You can transfer anything.
We have three sizes, small as a bone of butter, medium as a plate of eggs and large as a bass of beer.
Then there's no further restriction, and if anyone has a seat in the car, they'll probably carry the fridge.
Plus the sender has the option to take a picture of the package application, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack it if you don't want to hide the contents of the presentation.
You're gonna put the forgotten mike in your hand, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to start the job?
A friend got the idea over two years ago, when I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo application with a cross-border range, aimed mainly at a passenger plane.
At the moment, I told him I wasn't going to look for an investor, but I'd like to stay with him and save it myself.
Next year, we continued the development before we founded the company Shippansee LTD in London due to the greater credibility of the entire product.
But this isn't the version you're focusing on right now.
No, marketing has focused on Czech Republic, where we are trying to catch the application, because it all had birth pains and it's still something to solve and improve.
We are trying to react to the feedback from customers and we are currently not dealing with the foreign market.
We know it's a long run, but we don't take it, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the most basic and expensive application, the other two were in their way of upgrade.
The transfer occurred when we said that the national segment could be far more interesting and that we would at least learn it in Czech.
The third application of Mesík is local for the city.
But he can send the package to the exact address and the other end of the world.
It works for the senders as well as the Conveyance, but the difference is that in it as a courier you see the dispatches in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in the cell.
The application for the couriers who want to live on this, we called Mesíke Profi.
So someone can make an exposure by picking up packages around the city?
That's right, the last application will be downloaded in Prague like a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to take a trip to work.
Now that everyone's fooling around with those roommates, they can collect this all the same.
A person sees where orders are in the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and sent.
It's more cheap than competitive services.
At this point, we are still doing web interfaces that will be difficult for companies to send shipments to the web will fill in data about them, or create points on the map.
Then we're able to use their service every month.
Are you now committed to full consideration of the project?
It's bothering us, but we have it normally at work so that we can enjoy and develop the project.
We're not hiding behind a strong supranational investor, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other one jumped into it with other ideas and ideas.
Now we're looking for an investor strong enough to manage to hang with us not the Czech market, but who should go with us to the world product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The historical part of Titanfall 2 should bring a slightly forgotten pest.
This will fix the second part, and the only game in it will be the first information in the Call of Duty.
The length will move around the standard eight hours and the full is to come from the concept of network braking in the first part.
It is therefore possible to enjoy the freedom of movement, which includes, in addition to running, the possibility of using war titanium.
In addition to the action passports, the game will contain a level focused just on the reverse movement.
They'll remember the plates and include the ribs.
They are therefore the main example of double jumps, running down the walls and a chain lock.
Sometimes, however, enemies will have to be eliminated.
There will be no missing maps that remind you of the site and the level of special concepts.
In one example, it will be possible to lift and tear up the panels and close the possible door.
You'll be able to manage the form of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should therefore be linked between the ferocious action and the calmer moments for exploring the unknown planet.
We're gonna play Jack Cooper's footman dream about a pilot's career.
Cooper at the start of the campaign, together with Captain Lastimos, spends his time on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And there won't be a wilder to him.
In addition, in the event of a disaster, he will spare mortal wounds, and Cooper will therefore receive the task of carrying out the captain of the Titan.
His dream of a pilot's career will be fulfilled before he's expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery necessary to repair the robot.
Cooper's calls with the Titan will be important.
The players serve as a source of information about the military's past, but at the same time a robot-customed communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when the Titan will name all the wounds that Cooper is threatened with in the planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 brought the server Polygon.
The result will also be possible to judge in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the network game after Gamecom.
Titanfall 2 is October 28, and that's for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ mark survives, but the original edition remains dead.
Swedish Nordic company changes name to THQ Nordic.
After the publication of THQ in 2013, it received a number of its trademarks and the right to use the logo and company name.
Nordic thanks to this, for example, Darksiders 2 Deathnative Edition or package Red Faction Collection.
In addition, for publishing, there are 23 more games and 13 of them have not yet been discovered.
Thirty years ago, at the time of my retirement, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a younger man, our neighbor, about twenty years old.
I knew it from the beginning - first of all, it was obviously a long time ago, and then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she went in front of me.
She's totally crazy about him.
In those first days, she even changed her voice, had such a girl, in love with her voice.
But when I told her I know what's going on, she got it.
But I've noticed it all.
At that time, he went from work regularly to half a fourth, and so she always left in three to buy.
Every day she tried to see him.
Later, I found out they were meeting at his bar in the laundry.
I knew how many times they were right there.
I took care of my keys, he was determined to get them there.
But I don't know why, after all, I've always stayed home.
I've never been able to go there, take the decisive step.
Maybe you'll laugh at me, but I believe that my wife was mentally controlling me.
Soon I thought she found out that I was capable of doing what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just such a bastard.
Then the neighbors told me they knew about it too.
I was such a fool I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if all this was broken, it would be bad.
That it's going to happen to everyone in the family, she only knew something about her daughter.
So I always put it down, keep going.
But one time, I went to his apartment to get some help in the laundry.
He went there with me, and I told him that I got an anonymous, that he was meeting my wife, and that he was telling me everything.
I asked him what he was gonna tell me.
He stood there, shook his shoulders, looked into the ground and didn't say a word.
Then I also met his wife on the way out of the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond at all, and she didn't tell me.
No one said anything to me back then.
I'm a man who's never gone too far who has a problem meeting someone, but find a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I've always relied on it to end one day.
I told myself I'd forgive her all this and my life will go on.
But it wasn't.
And I've never actually dealt with it.
I've got it in me so far.
I used to give it to her quite often, but I finally left it for peace.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife's home.
At home she always did everything - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's working.
I always thought she was trying not to have another reason to complain.
And it can be said that it's good.
But sometimes I'd like to see her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me she never loved me.
She loved me and loved me, but she didn't love me.
And I see he loves him today, he's her god.
And I don't enjoy that kind of life.
When it started, and I carried it very badly, I told her once I didn't want to live, and I wondered what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought and said, "But there's plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to create a new French Islamic hope that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After the terrorist attacks, France is fighting radical Islamists and the government is calling for help from a local Muslim minority.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be even harder for France to guarantee freedom of expression," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual education in France is taught in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mixed from abroad, when the teachers often come with money from watching jazz.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wanted to create a new French Islamic hope, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution replaces the current French Peace Prize for Islam, established by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
It had already contributed to the simplification of the financial flows between the blends and the countries that financed their construction.
Soon, though, internal conflicts struck her, and she never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
In front of the new award, the former Minister of Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevénement, who is known as the founder of the secular state, will probably become the former Minister of Interior and Defence.
In France, about 2,500 blends and prayer are used, about 120 of them serve radical Islam.
Since 2012, the French authorities from the country have made up about 80 Islamic clergy and several more decades have considered this step.
This week, the German police also attacked the Jewish clergy.
Imams reportedly spoke up fighters for the Islamic state.
One of them operated space where the believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the debate on a new institution was heated in France, which will replace the non-functional reward.
All stepped up further terrorist attacks, which on behalf of the Islamic State carried out by radical Islamists.
The new award will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mixed household resources and also to monitor the assets.
But it's not clear where he gets the money, even though he's considering a few proposals.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, especially for meat from defeats according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by sellers to collect food for permission.
Some of the money would then travel to the budget of the donation.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French passengers who are issuing to Mecca.
Every year they go on a traditional tour to Saudi Arabia, leaving France about 30 thousand.
In addition, only teachers who have passed educational programs at the universities in France should be involved.
As a result, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government also shuts down radical mixtures.
"From December we have closed twenty and will follow the next," interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
"There is no place in France for those who declare hate and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at the shopping center in northern Zaragoza, reports the Independent Journal.
There was a shooting after the woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the shopping mall, where he also started shooting.
According to the witnesses, a man turned his gun against himself, says the Independent.
A woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, and for a man in critical condition she had to get a cure.
The crime occurred around 11 a.m. in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous region of Aragon, near local universities.
With a call from the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the reason was probably the recent divorce of both partners.
The party with the cross, we wake up with the races, the bells, and the chili sauce.
This summer he wants a light, well-satisfied meal, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our heads.
And so out of the summer gardens smell the grilled cow, the goat, the wolf's knee.
Not too healthy, not too easy, yet sometimes with the exception of salad or roasted vegetables.
The truth is, grilling is time-saving, and also it's a social matter, and no one has to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are also other alternatives to making good wishes, which especially stuttering, their preparation is a small ritual, but there is nothing more to be done than to produce, to eat, to eat or to breathe.
And they're still contributing to our health.
Whether it's a domestic sushi or sashi, where quality raw materials and a few well-contained gryphons are going to make the preparation fun and the food itself a genuine exotic box.
Just like even easier rolls in the rice paper from today's recipe.
There's even more time-consuming cooking and freezing rice here.
The paper can only sink into the water for a moment and then only depends on the imagination of the chef, how he intends to play with the fillings and supplements.
There's no race like race.
The benefits of a number of Asian cuisine are also today that raw materials are usually available.
Includes loaded sweetening gum, which is one of the basic flavors of the sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the right pink gourmet gash has a unique picket blade and at the same time a pleasant taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it mixes with several kinds of octopus and celery.
It is enough to buy a bag of appropriate sizes, and the annex with demonstrable antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are especially used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and cooking meals in the most diverse celebrations and rituals.
Long numbered banana leaves are widely extended in a number of countries in Asia or South America as well as "aid" for the preparation of the most diverse cooked, cooked and roasted foods, which are packed in them like in the alobal.
The banana leaf then conveys a specific taste.
We are allowed to buy in stores with exotic fruit and vegetables, even previously cut into the shape of a doll.
But select only green sheets, and you will be healthy, unbleached and unbleached.
Similarly, it is easy to make salads from the varieties wama, sesame and sesame oil.
He can buy himself frozen again.
Whoever often prepares her or sushi will probably know a lot of crazy.
In Japan, this is one of the most important species of marine species, from which the so-called nut is produced by the pollination, drying and drying of so-called nut leaves - the wages for the production of sushi.
Wakam - a dark green breed growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaidó - is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the nut breed.
By the way, those who do not know how to harvest the soup with wama are supposed to be used by Asian women for breeding after birth.
And at all, this variety of effects is almost miraculous.
Pure blood, it enhances blood circulation, even supposedly prevents hair graying and is literally charged with mineral substances.
Dried and diluted cotton is also used as root, for example, for the taste of rice.
The fresh varieties are first let to boil in the water, then soften, put into the boiling water, and cook half a minute.
Then it cools in the ice water, cuts the middle ribs, and further adjusts, perhaps like a favorite salad.
However, buying it is the easiest solution.
So there's only one left to wrap the roll with easy vegetable filling, gentle and light, full of healthy tastes.
It's a long-term bomb.
If you resist and you don't join the grilled beak.
Eating healthy, light and summer.
The Asians know how to do it.
There are only a few special raw materials and a lot of snacks, and you have interesting fresh food that combines flavors.
And it's ready twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrot, 40 g of white order, 100 g of green cross, 60 g of salad cake, 60 g of wama sauce and 60 g of sweet chili sauce.
Squeaking coriander, black sesame spoon, chili cheese spoon, 20 g of manga and 40 g of loaded cast iron, a little pine nuts.
First, we're gonna get some scissors ready.
We're gonna put the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we'll take her out and wait for her to faint.
In the meantime, in hot water, we will soon bring out the crucibles, about three minutes after which we will allow them to cool quickly into the ice water so that they do not lose their color.
We'll put the green paper in and pack it.
We make full of white rares, carrots and salads, which we put on soft noodles, we mix them with sweet chili sauce, we add saturated coriander, we mix thoroughly and we put on rice paper.
On the banana leaf, we put the crucibles, add the candles, and finally we get the whole meal with a bunch of wama, loaded with the bellows, a manga plate, a black sauce, and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle silver in a seven-year-old rug, Fiji picks gold
The powerful performance of the United Kingdom in the week-long race ended with a zero foot on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated in the final match on Thursday night of Britain at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijians taught the master's lesson in processing, puzzles, puzzles, supporting games, running on lain and brutal forces - and won gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an unwatched price of relief in the form of a silver medal - for Britain on the third day - and the British could be at their performances in the opening Olympic tournament of the seventh race, defeated New Zealand, Argentina, and the South African Republic.
The battle over South Africa 7:5 in the semifinal on the same day, may have been frozen in the final.
Of course, Fiji would also defeat a 15-member team in full health.
Well, I guess it's not going to be comfortable for the British, but they can be happy that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their neck tomorrow: the main fan of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain hit a piece of the road.
Eight years ago under Ryan's leadership, they lost every match in Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This defeat hurts, but progress is irrefutable.
Fiji began a great deal, Britain's portals reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and other associates it was like running for a series of buses in motion and the world Cup champions led 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau was out of the corner.
The clock showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and Britain hit the heavy ball.
Great Mitchell tried to stop huge Leon Nakarawa and stop him from scored third, but only Fijian slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua hitdown into the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another one after the return and the hours still remained more than 1 minute... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravov then penetrated the tiny Brits and joined the lasagna where he scored.
After the conversion to the 29:0 point, the break followed.
It was like Fiji was born for the 7s, while the British were still learning the surrender.
That's exactly the way it is.
After half-time, the British made a lot of changes, and the efforts of the Fijians stopped... for four minutes, which compared to the first half was good until the brilliant midway between Fiji's Joshua Tuis continued.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for Britain, threw touchdown into the left corner, and 36:7. But the win had long been won by the inhabitants of the Pacific islands and their fans on the goose sang, had flagged and danced.
It was hard not to admire the totally gratified attitude of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame still cooled another attempt to win the Fijians.
The writer called, the Fijians hugged, and the British fell on the lawn full of excitement.
Earlier that same day Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 in a semifinal, and Britain defeated the South African Republic in a close semifinal - the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got South Africans in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his hard work, broke the defense line and scored in the second half under his finger.
Marcus Watson, Anthony’s brother from England’s 15th team, won - and finally also won the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning's for victory in the Velsary race inspired the fight of coach with cancer
You won't find more emotional gold in these games - and that's what you say.
From the first to the last, during 220 of the exhausts in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
While the two were happy, there were three voices in the boat. When the ship was hungry to shake the second Olympic gold behind it in the women's race, there was still a voice in the boat with them, coach Robin Williams. They are the first women in the history of British sports that achieved such a result.
Their weight was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unaccompanied.
What we see - two excellent athletes, as they fly along the water level with the elegant labyrinth - does not reflect the character of victory entirely.
For every gold medal from the vesting is a battalion with helpful hands, which a piece after a piece means a difference. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who did not know whether to live this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to his words, it wasn't true.
I've had cancer of the bladder that can be operated, and I've undergone this operation.
Without an operation, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
Somehow it'll change your view of the thing.
Cancer was found to Williams in December 2013.
Fortunately for the whole trio it was possible to get treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, and to reduce the accident to a minimum - if so we can call it under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together fast.
That's what he was moved to do.
I was in the hospital and I went to the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time when they said a few steps were enough.
That's how it started.
The wedding itself is the way, but it was more of a matter.
Immediately after winning, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to control his own discomfort.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal College's staff, who is behind the mission in Afghanistan, said: "This week I was with emotion at the bottom, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
Again, it highlights how much it means to me, how much Helen and Robin and I worked together.
So far, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so he's got a huge thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't wish for a better man to train or a better boy.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the only race in five years.
Two of them had an amazing rhythm that their rivals could not balance.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began approaching, Stanningová had a very large reserve.
We've been focusing at a certain point.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to let go.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we didn't try to achieve anything famous.
We weren't happy about today's fireworks, we just wanted to make a good trip, go out and win the race, which we did.
We'll take two years to think before they decide what's next.
Glover's getting married next week, and she's having a TV show with Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was gonna be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London before they found out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
I have a much better feeling," she said.

Prison?
Rather than driving people for free, the cab driver of Rubes says to the breakup complaint.
Six taxi drivers and ex-master's official in Prague are, according to CT, a complaint.
You have made a series of reports in which you have discovered misleading practices and those that are to be in the group that will be held before the court.
You've been dealing with a couple of unpleasant moves with discovered actors.
How much is the report on the complaint of members of the organised group a breakthrough for you?
I've been waiting for some court to come.
I'm mostly curious about judgment.
I don't think they should be in jail.
It's nothing.
First of all, they should pay back all the stolen money.
And they should get them back so that they'll drive all the people free.
That's kind of a terrible solution.
Does this mean, then, that you don't feel like an effective punishment?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so scared that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes a pingle, the other weighs pizza, and one's totally screwed up on it.
Indictees can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think it's an adequate rate?
I usually have a problem with freedom.
I think it's a bad punishment.
Locking someone in prison, especially in this case, is nonsense.
Such people should return to the companies that took her.
The fourth century saw the destruction of our land and the theft of the people.
So let's make a good visit now and let's get people out of here for free.
I can't imagine.
It would work as a public benefit.
As someone goes to collect the waste, they'd get a car and they'd drive people to Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll finally get a condition and they'll care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříčka Film Academy in Písk and then at the University of Tomáš Bati in Zlín.
They belong to people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
She works as an editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where she is sharing in a series of shows, now she is preparing the Prague Guide series, which is intended primarily for foreign audiences.
The Rubes, in the form of short reports, advises what services to avoid in Prague and what the contrary recommends without fear to use.
He used to film a series called How to, City of Fads?, Life in luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Prague.
In the complaint, they are referred to as an organized group.
The police followed her for a few months.
Can such a network of subversive taxi drivers be identified as mafia?
They're such cute mafia people, not as we know from Kmotra.
It's more about the mafia than the juniors, but the organization is certain.
It's just that they're looking after each other.
The dust is completely disaggregated.
I followed that, for example, the main station doesn't like Paris, Paris doesn't like the taxi drivers waiting for Karl's Lázní (disco club)
Everyone just keeps an eye on their place, and every group is kind of organized.
It's probably a complex network.
However, there are only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate who warned the driver against the controls.
As you're saying, the sideshows didn't disappear from the street.
So what's the percentage between the Prague substations in the taxi service according to your estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still.
I'm talking about Alex Ryjak.
It's a man who's really dangerous - in his car he rides telescopic shoes, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at Karl's bridge and drives people.
Last time I went with him, he wanted me for seven hundred miles.
His police didn't stop for any reason.
Only a few people from all over the big group were selected.
The same situation, however, is also in other locations in Prague.
Unfortunately, then, seven people find it difficult to clear the already pronounced Prague mess, which seems to have much bigger dimensions.
Of course it's nothing.
It's gonna help, but all the evil isn't gonna get over it, that's the truth.
Are there taxi drivers who steal foreign tourists still in the same places that you showed in the reports, that is, at Karl's bridge or on the Paris street?
Yeah, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day, and every day they break the notices.
He ignores both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It's not even a cocours anymore, but it's a total nonsense.
Business of Prague taxis in numbers
However, some of them, although it's only a part of the group, will be brought before the court.
It's already a break.
So I have to ask myself, do you feel satisfaction?
If I took it as a compliment, it would be wrong, because it was my goal, and it would always be to improve the centre of Prague.
And even if I feel like it's a little bit better, I'll keep going.
You need to press the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief is left there, we should still do something to get rid of him.
You can't take it easy.
But it's not like that, of course, there's more.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in taxis?
Sometimes I do tests and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cab driver, apart from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He learned 560 crowns in three kilometers, although he then claimed that it was 56 crowns (using a ten - wheel trick).
He had that cover, the police arrived, and this cab driver was so excited that he was still following those cops and asked them when someone finally gave him those 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the taximeter has placed a dozen stamp and stole tourists with 357 crowns.
It is said that the strength of the subversive taxi drivers did not rise even after you showed the faces of those who counted the foolish amounts for a short ride in your pictures?
Their strength is still incredible.
How did that cab driver get 56 crowns?
The cops sent him away because they couldn't discuss him on the spot because he had a bill.
And that's, I think, a problem with the court (six taxi drivers and one ex-director).
On the one hand, there will be a cab driver with his bills, on the other hand, the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate shall not use the secret taxi service recordings as evidence at the court.
When I filmed the parts about their frauds, the cab drivers themselves warned me about this precedent.
I've always wanted to use the footage for the report.
Are you afraid that this fact could protect them from trial?
I hope every judge will understand that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns a mile because he would not live for it.
You've been talking about a trick with a ten-year-old who's particularly seen by foreign customers as a subterranean taxi driver.
Is it still current, or are they worried about using this figure after publishing your reports?
I think we've been popularizing this trick by sending out a series.
I recently went with a cab driver, and he boasted in front of me that he was the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed that the black glue was attached to the taximeter.
When I asked him what it was like, he said, "You know what it is."
If a taxi driver didn't work too well, could a court order their colleagues?
Is there anything he can do to get rid of the lies?
You've been talking about the way you think they're going to cheat, they'll always find it.
I don't think he can do it.
But someone can push them out of these places.
And they're fair cab drivers who should get more work out of there so they can really get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that these fair cab drivers in Prague are fortunately considering.
But do they like to go against those who punish the reputation of their service?
They've got taste, but they're missing their mind.
They can't walk in it, and they can't say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (because of the proposal for total restrictions from Adriana Krnáč's office), it was not very clear what they actually wanted.
Once they said they didn't protest Uber, that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It happened that they just blocked Prague and it only created the best possible commercial for Uber.
How do you fully assess the approach of the Prague magistrate to solve the problem of pre-flighting the driver?
It's obvious that she had to get into this until the criminal police came in to settle something.
The magistrate was short on it.
They had a letter that provided information, which means that the cab department did its work for a few years completely unnecessary.
I hope that this officer is being trained in the final check-up of all the tired checks to know what he's done.
That's the worst thing I've ever seen.
I was even with him on a check-in ride, which I found out after their appointment.
A few months have passed since the last series was published.
What's the answer?
I mean, mostly in foreign audiences, than the series is actually the most focused.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I'll release the video to them.
And then when we go to the Old Town Square, it's a surprise that the same people who are seeing the footage are really standing there.
Innocently pronounced Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd build a fence around them to get people to look at them.
Museum of Communism directly on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you drive a taxi when you need it?
Sure.
I'm driving services that I don't have to pay cash, but with a card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there's a lot of dyspepsia that's fair.
I've only taken a cab on the street since then.
The driver told me after the car, "Well, you've got the courage."
I'm dressed as an Italian tourist.
It has already been written about the fraudulent practices of taxi drivers in 2005.
In the same year, a former Prime Minister, Paul Bem, set out for a check-in trip in an Italian tourist suit, and immediately to his first attempt, his driver lost two hundred.
But editor Rubes had worse experience.
The taxi drivers taught him to drive from Old Town to Václav Square 820 kroner, which is about 195 kroner per kilometer, as reported by the reporters.
The Prague magistrate then set a maximum price of 28 kroner per mile.
There are also other surprising amounts in the report: for example, a two-kilometre journey from the Paris street to the Truhlářský resort of 400 kroner.
The expensive rides also provided taxi drivers waiting at Karl's bridge.
For the ride to Angel, which is 2.5 kilometers away, you have to charge six and a half crowns.
The marble is washed mostly with clean water, the most without chemistry and the longer the better.
Its impurities go well, although sometimes the dirt has to go down with a scalpel, it has to be removed from the shields.
It's not easy, and it's not going fast, it's getting close to Vanessa Trost's work from Oldrich in The Hague.
A hole down in front of it: the tomb is built by a sink, after which it is necessary to go straight out and go down again.
"The restaurant should be careful, patient and non-confidential in the working environment," she noted.
In Friedlantsk, it's not far from her first restoration work.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the back of the Friedlant Council, also restored the juices of St. Mary Magdalena in Zatiš, St. John Nepomucký in Friedlant, Pietu in Friedlant County Street, Mariana column in Friedlant or atlants across the spa in New City under Smrk.
With the reconstruction of Melchiora, Kristofa and Caterina from Rederna, Frydlanta began in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned from the wear of impurities and the cross, the loose parts of the stone will be protected against falling and moving; either into the wall or against each other.
It is also waiting for treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gold again.
"Then begins with the freezing of inscriptions on marble boards with silver plated gold," said the reference State memory care of the city office in Frydlant Věr Sobotová.
There are no records from the past that the tomb would have been repaired.
In a closer look, the openings drawn in marble columns will be opened.
They're hundreds of years old and it's about the remains after the funeral.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately everything disappeared after the Swedish trip to the Thirty Years Wars.
They literally saw the tomb, marked Sobot.
In the church of the founding of the Holy Cross there are restaurants with a small surface like home.
After the flood in 2010, there was a need to put in order the burials that were dug under the water, the churches were restored, the wall paintings in the tomb and now the tomb.
"We would also like to let ourselves into the war in the future," Sobot said.
The church is in a very good state, every year to maintain and repair money.
Restaurant work on the renovation of the reindeer's tomb will total 128 thousand crowns.
They will be played with grants, the city will not deposit any of its money into this part of the renovation.
Hundreds of crowns will come from the victory in the district round of the Historical City of 2015, the remaining 28,000 crowns are then the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, explained by Mayor Frydlanta Dan Ramzer.
Retirement of the Retirement Retirement Prize was decided by the representative.
Opinions of experts on future developments in selected foreign markets followed by indices and comparison with the Czech Capital Market (PX) in the horizon of one month and a half years.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year.
The American S&P500 index, which went through 12% of the corrections in February, is today at the new historical maximum and has already subscribed 7% since the beginning of the year.
Once again it is confirmed by the iron rule that traders should never go against the interests of central banks that have finally reached their own.
In a situation where American shares at the historical maximum are again the volume of volatility, which is currently at the lowest since 2014, when markets grew peacefully and without fear due to the quantitative release of the US Central Bank and when the current Volatility Index (VIX) remained stable below the 12 per cent threshold.
And not to.
Although the Fed market continues to prepare for a gradual increase in interest rates, the quantitative release in Europe and Japan is in full flow and last week has also joined the Bank of England, which will purchase debt securities in the next six months in volume of 70 billion pounds.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative release is already pushing so low outputs even below and contributes to almost complete elimination of risk and fear from the future.
How long will this condition last?
That's, of course, a million question.
At the moment, however, there are no risks at all, the world economy is experiencing almost constant growth without major increases, the situation in the commodity market and in China is stabilised and the brexit is no longer essentially a topic, so we should not be too surprised if, in a similar peaceful regime, American action is still taking place.
It's a shame that Juncker isn't studying Klaus!
I'm very glad my friend Michel Barnier took on this important and demanding task.
I wanted to make this difficult work of the experienced policy, said Mr Juncker, head of the European Commission, when the French policy (actually experienced, because the overriding so many of the most diverse international political functions that we would look for a better example of the so-called European elite) appointed the European Commission's chief negotiator for the terms of departure from the United Kingdom.
Juncker's election sparked signs that it is in the EU's serious interest to look for a form of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
Most British media, however, adopted the name Barnier as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
The Great Britain hates it.
As a European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009 - 2014), he was concerned about the reform of European banking law.
He explained it as he could only grasp it: a strong enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of free market and the model of capitalism.
The establishment of multilateral regulations was a co-author of the so-called banking union and is in favour of everything from the London Financial Centre City, which has promoted legislation overhauling hard financial sector regulations and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, unbridled, and probably an independent negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
How not to mention in this context the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which so much has contributed the resolution, review and capacity of Prime Minister Václav Klaus.
That is why today the Czechs can be the closest friends and allies.
It's a shame that Juncker from Václav Klaus - at least in this - didn't learn.
It would be for everyone!
Earthquake around Putin?
Governor Kremlu missed his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin missed Sergei Ivanov on Friday from the post of head of the President's office.
Let's take his place, Anton Warno.
She informed the Russian media about this by calling for a press release in Kremlu.
Putin then indicated Ivanov's leaving on his own request.
At a meeting that was broadcast by the Rossija 24 television station, the president said that Ivanov's wish to be the head of the president's office for a maximum of four years was met.
At the same time, he announced Ivanov would be his special representative for the environment and transport.
The report on exchange in the head of the administrative president, now led by Ivanov's current representative Vajno, is considered rather surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is one of Putin's closest associates.
This former KGB officer in the past, for example, was the minister of defence and vice-president of the government.
The President's membership of the Security Council is now leaving.
Ivanov, at his meeting with Putin, stated that the long break in the head of the state's administrative head was actually a recordman.
He's been in it for four years and eight months.
In this regard, he recalled that 11 people had already been appointed in this function for 25 years since its establishment.
Flowers and deliists Stryce don't play Shafárá's finals.
Not one of the Friday tennis matches has yet been able to change in final participation.
As the first battle lost Peter Kvitov, who was subjected to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puigov after centuries 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, Czech deliists followed the Cafari with St.
The winner of the Williams Sisters in the first set saw after winning, however, two sets of matches were lost and Russia finally used the set in a short game.
The second set then lost 4:6.
The half success in the early morning program in Rio was recorded by the Czech twins: skier Ondřij Synek won his semifinals with a review, when the second Damira Martina from Croatia defeated even after his release in almost a second.
Good day, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, I brought in the Son.
His opponents had to fight against him.
So it's got some power on them, it could be easier on them tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing in my cart, the Prague Dukly.
Mirka Topinkova-Knapkova, but she didn't walk in the snowflakes.
The five-year-old midwife sat in today's semifinals in her fourth position on Saturday, waiting for her start in the B finals and fighting from 7th to 12th place.
The gold from London doesn't work that way.
I didn't go to the finals at the Olympics for the first time.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I went to a quality race, and I put everything in it.
The rivals were just better, they'd moved in front of them Topin's button.
She fought to the end and believed that her fourth game would be between the elite six.
The fight has given up just ahead of the goal.
I knew the girls were balanced, that anyone could get out of this field.
I was surprised by the Chinese that she had such a finish.
And I thought I'd be able to get to the finals through the Rakushank.
Unfortunately, today a life race, the 2011 World Championships said.
Far behind the final gates in Rio, a young shooter Philip Nepeichal remained, who was unable to cope with his qualifications this time.
Nepeichal had a 33rd place in it.
Qualifications are the best for the Russians.
From the first branch, Sergei Kamenskij was sent with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
The fireman's gun had a value of 620.5 points.
For the first time in Rio, the athletes, including the Czech seven-member Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučina, also talked about the program.
The Cachs belong to the 11th place after the second discipline of the Olympics competition, the Czech recordman Eliška Klučinová is twelve.
Head of British Katarina Johnson-Thampson, which jumped to a height of 198 centimeters as well as the continually second Belgian Nafisatou Thiam.
Both have taken care of the historically best performance in the course of the seven.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but they didn't make it.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we look at the absurdity of the question, the German society has gone through a deep self-reflex, which is not Russian.
In both large European nations, dictators emerged in the 20th century, and they came to the power of a regime that was non-existent, brutal and terrible.
From 1917 to 1989, Russian Bolsheviks have contributed a great deal to 94 million victims of communism, which the Black Book of communism, whether it was a daily individual repression, targeted hunger, inadequate war management or non-military experiments.
In a non - Indian way, the Nazis stared about 6 million Jews, and the total victims of World War II were estimated to be 60 million.
In occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and the Soviets carried out beast worship.
In Germany and the USSR, only a few individuals were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, either actively, passively or by cutting their heads in the sand.
It's not just the specificity of these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the immediate end of the war came denouncing, the Nuremberg Court.
But the most important thing happened later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask: "Dad, Grandpa, why did you participate in such rituals?
How could you?
This has brought true reflection and healing to society.
Germany's elites have recently taken care of the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the welfare of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but certainly they can't connect them back to Alsace-Lotrinsko or anyone - to remunerate - military attack - it may be recognized by everyone.
After the cold war in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed at the end of the thousand years when the former KGB officer (sic!)Vladimir Putin came to power.
Often criminal history is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putinovsk Russia is remunerated, the acquisition of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity and the future of their own people is not worth it to the believer.
Fight yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally disadvantaged - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
To whom does the tension grow around Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
In the last days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in Crimea has worsened.
To whom does the increase in tension come?
After a long period of relative peace, there was another deterioration in relations between Ukraine and Russia.
The closure of the Ukrainian side became the Krym peninsula, which was connected more than 2 years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
Of course, reports from both sides of the enemy are contradictory, and it is difficult to verify them independently, so we can only think of an old known question for whom it is?
According to reports from Moscow, terrorist attacks on Crimea have occurred on the Ukrainian side, which Ukraine, of course, rejects and blames Kreml for the provocation.
For information on the arrest of Ukrainian special units in the territory of Russia, Savchenkové has already received a known response that they were allegedly kidnapped in the territory of Russia.
If we were to join the Ukrainian version, in what way would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is nothing.
The escalation of tension around Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further sanctioning and strengthening the anti-Russia campaign.
In recent years, the immigration crisis in Europe has led to a shift in attention from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukraine's leadership has already lost its entire credit in front of its inhabitants, when the current support of President Porošenka moves around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have long since been bankrupt without a generous EU financial injection, and especially the IMF.
In this situation, it is necessary for the Ukrainian regime to pay close attention to its country again so as to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation before voters in its country.
President Porošenko and other members of the executive board of the strengths again want to be seen as strong men who are afraid of becoming a great Russian.
It is only hoped that all those who are trying to resolve the open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers but all ordinary people on both sides of the enemy and stop their enemy actions.
Bulgaria first showed inflation in eight months
According to national statistics, inflation reached 1 % in Bulgaria in July.
This is the highest value for several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October of last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0,2 % was published.
The annual average rate of inflation, measured by the CPI index, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0% and monthly inflation was 1,0%.
The inflation rate from the beginning of the year (June 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2 % and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 versus July 2015 was -0.2 %.
Against the background of the previous month, in July 2016, the road to the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2,2 %), furniture, household equipment and regular maintenance (0,5 %), health (0,1 %).
At the same level as last month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained.
The U.S. Secret Service was watching the Russian hacker attacks last year.
Russian attacks were reported to the public last month, when the Federal Investigation Office (FBI) announced that it was engaged in an attack on the servers of the site centre of the Democrats.
However, there is no official report on the Russian attack.
Moscow's share of the attack has been denied.
The report on the monitoring of the alleged Russian attack was very secret, because its expression would show that US secret services are monitoring and revealing the hacker attack could also be the way they do it and the resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence services participated in the attacks.
New Advisory Body for Cybersecurity
The Russian track tracking material was coded and had access to it only a small group of experts, wrote Reuters.
Only a small group of eight Congressional Members, called the U.S. gang, were informed of the public.
It is composed of both the chief chamber of Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the presidents of both the chambers of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the Congress' defence and security committees.
The Head of Democratic Party Donna Brazil announced Thursday that he is setting up a cyber security advisory committee to "stop future attacks and ensure the first-class protection of the servers of the Democratic Party".
There was a dangerous parasite in the accepted salmon from Albert.
The network apologized.
Based on the initiative of consumers on health problems after consumption of food Losos wildly recognized - pieces 100 g, date of consumption 22.11.2016 they carried out Prague hygienics control in sales Albert at the Václav Square and at the Męstka.
The verification found that the L23012562/T4 loads with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, on which the customer pointed out that they are no longer available, and therefore the product of the same batch was selected with the date of consumption 11.12.2016.
The laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It's a parasitic worm of the tracheal tract of marine mammals.
This is dangerous for a man - larvae in the body’s chest or muscle fish are a strong allergen and human exposed live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, Štich said.
We apologize very much to customers for the problems of this brand.
We immediately removed the stock item from the sale, and for preventive reasons we downloaded all the other stock items.
There was a doubt on the supplier's side that we're dealing with, and at the same time we let this product test ourselves, said Newsman Albert Barbor Vanko.
If the customer bought this product, he can return it to any of the chain stores and get the money back.
The larvae destroys the frost and sufficient heat adjustment
The salesman was the company Nekton - Vrňata.
The hygiene authorities informed the Prague and Middle East veterinary authorities of the existence of a dangerous product.
According to the food safety server, people after exposure to parasites may be ill with anisakiosis, which occurs with acute abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or illness can occur without signs, the CHK has indicated.
Symptoms will be delivered within an hour of two weeks after consumption of insufficiently treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the beginning of the larvae’s disease, most spontaneously abandon the tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and lower temperatures, so they are either killed when they are hot enough to process fish meat or when they are frozen.
The veterinarians have checked the salmon at the time with the recipient of the imported goods in the Mediterranean.
Three of the five samples studied had parasites in them.
The supplier arrived in the Czech Republic in 1700 according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of April.
It was shipped, in general, to the Ahold chain, to this day 919 packages.
At the present time, unsold stock of the product is being downloaded from the sale, SVS spokesperson Petr Peichal said on Friday.
As soon as positive samples were found, the veterinarians prohibited the dispatch of other products from the warehouse.
Seventeen-year-old Britta wanted to get out of Rakka, probably killed her by a Russian raid.
After the initial excitement and quick touch with the jihadite who was killed by the dragons, there was an excrement.
The expected paradise of the caliphate has turned for British girls into hell on earth, from which there has been no escape.
The girl was related to her sister Halimo.
She called Britain again and believed she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic state is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have no reason to shoot, quoted The Telegraph as a family lawyer by Tasnim Akunjee.
The last tracks led to Rakka, from where the girl called last.
Then only the report of her death has come, but it cannot be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in eastern London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
That's where they hoped to meet the former student again.
Kadiza, however, was probably killed before she could escape because the house where she was staying was compared to the country in May, the British ITV News reported.
TV added that the bomb was likely dropped by a Russian aircraft that attacked the IS garden in Syria.
You'd take the blues out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
The week she (Kadiza) thought about fleeing from the territory of the Islamic State, one Rakušanka was arrested while trying to escape and, according to the information available, she was publicly killed to death.
I think she put it out as a warning and decided not to worry, according to the BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old friends from Shamimo Begum and Amir Abass school, were released on February 17th last year.
The only thing they said at home was they were going out.
But they headed to Gatwick airport and from it across Turkey to the territory of ISIS.
The family of the girl according to the lawyer did everything in her power to get Kadiz back.
You would take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of the dangerous area, and this family would do everything she could to make every effort to get her daughter home.
But it wasn't possible without the risk of being caught by a lawyer.
The only positive thing he thinks is that Kadizy's fate can serve as a frightening case for other girls or even the boys who are getting fucked up by Islamic propaganda.
"There are many cases when people left, realized how things are, understood how far they are different from the promises of the Islamic state propaganda, and wanted to return," Akunjee noted.
The fate of Kadiz's associates is unknown.
However, since they have also been silent, their families must be at peace with the fact that they are most likely dead.
To prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go to a net without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the center of the country and the headquarters of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the 18th century, there have been courts at the council, and the basement has served as a local prison.
The conditions in which they lived were sad and many prisoners tried to escape.
Many of them were successful.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more attractive, warm and gas lighting for prisoners.
In either case, it was not in operation for a long time, and its closure was due to economic reasons at the end of August 1889, since smaller repair facilities were costly to operate and did not pay too much.
The stories of the jailers and the ghosts.
For the public, the prison was opened centuries later, visitors could compare the old building to a new one to see how different conditions prevailed in them.
Leaders in day-to-day costumes are still strengthening their authentic experience.
To see it, there is also a torture room where visitors can learn what forms of punishment applied to criminals, whether it was the grinding of fingers or the burning of marks on the body.
During the tour, tourists may be confined to one of the goals, mostly because of photos on the memory, or to guide themselves to the sense that the prisoners are living behind the grid.
By the way, the Inveraray prison is one of the most famous Scottish localities, where it is supposed to be scary.
There have already been a number of groups of paranormal hunters, and to this day the museum allows people to come to catch some ghosts.
That night, however, will amount to 300 pounds, which is estimated to be about 9500 crowns.
The village, in addition to this popular tourist attraction, also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
"Anime" effect on Snapchat is criticised as Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by animes, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat application every day allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with the identity of ways that border with absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog or a figure that looks like it came out of Roy Lichtenstein's picture.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and every day generate more than 30 million improved self.
Any mistake will be made immediately.
The Snapchat filters in the past have served a criticism of the fact that the application promotes blackfacing or that it supports the white hair of the skin as an ideal beauty.
So when this week she offered users a filter that made them look ugly, curved, and curved faces, some critics called it the Asian racist cartoon "yelowface."
And they were wondering if these repeated controversial questions would show a bigger problem for society - a problem with diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote and the news and the excitement spread quickly and Snapchat immediately indicated that the function had been canceled.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as an expression of the accounts I make animated, not as an Asian cartoon.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter recalled painful stereotypes in action.
The others refused to compare the package with the souls.
Grace Spapani, a student of American art from Korea, whose photo tweet was widely shared, stated in the e-mail that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing."
She added that “it is difficult to argue against the comparison of the obvious Asian character and the effects of the filter.
It is shown that the filter is not only about the yellowface, but that the yellow face is affected to the creamy extremities.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
It seems that American culture has an endless battle for diversity and inclusion, from the sessions in corporations after Hollywood and the devices that we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people in Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
“When one Snapchat filter creates a picture that is offensive to some user,” said fifty-one Katie Zhu on Thursday in the conversation, “but these things will be very difficult today without notice, as it was earlier.”
Katie Zhu, the product manager and designer who works for the Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her account on Snapchat and invited others to do the same.
In the article for the Media and in the telephone interview, she stated that she was convinced that racially motivated problems reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment of workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhu was critical of the overwhelming white, completely male management of the company and the article included hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's like they don't have any diversity and color people between employees at the moment they decide on these things," said Zhuová, who has Chinese-American origin, "or color people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or pleasant to talk about."
Other observers share her opinion - the complaint Snapchat left to a considerable extent without an answer.
The company does not publish the figures relating to the diversity of its employees by having private company status.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his employees, but according to the speaker, she recently adopted a recruitment worker who should focus on insufficiently represented populations and internal management.
Zhuová adds: “I wonder if they really need other users who can say that it’s not okay, ” with their account being canceled.
Military officials have drawn up information on IS, the parliamentary committee says
In a report issued on Thursday, the parliamentary committee stated that officials from the central government of the United States changed the reports of the intelligence service to reflect a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than they had provided from the country.
According to the preliminary report of the Working Group composed of the Republican Chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, the Committee on Intelligence and the Defence Sub-Committee, a "extensive dissatisfaction" was found between the Central Intelligence Service analysts, according to which their supervisors changed their assessment of the US effort to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is an army headquarters in Tampea, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release states: “The outputs of classified intelligence services approved by senior officials of Centcom have usually offered a more positive picture of the US counter-terrorism efforts than those confirmed by the facts on earth, and have consistently been more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the reporting community.”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are injured when the fault analysis is submitted to senior policy makers," said Ken Calvert, Congressman and Republican of California.
The failure of Centcom's leadership reaches the top of the organization.
The ten-page report sets out in detail the continuing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analysing American efforts in training Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although no decisive evidence is available that the Supreme Representatives of Obama have ordered that the reports be amended, it is stated in the report that the analysts felt that they were under pressure from the Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State or the IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many press reports from the Central Staff, statements and statements from the Congress were significantly more positive than what events were actually happening”, the report states.
For example, the representative of Centcom publicly announced that a major military attack on the takeover of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is quite clear after the months of the investigation," said the representative of the Republican Party of Kansas in a statement by Mr Pompeo.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest ranking staff of the US Central Intelligence Service have manipulated the staff with reports of the staff with a view to baggageing the danger of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a working group after learning about the concerns of analysts that information from the intelligence services concerning the Islamic State is being manipulated.
Following the report published on Thursday, further examinations must be followed.
In the Centcom intelligence services, further investigations are being carried out by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defence.
The Democratic Members of the Committee for the Reporting Services published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Working Group of the Republicans.
"between 2014 and 2015 Centcom has created a very narrow process for evaluating information on IS and Iraqi security components," said representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and representative of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process "has led to the transformation of the outputs of the intelligence services", has damaged the morale among analysts and "has taken insufficient account of the inconsistencies."
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they did not find any evidence that the White House would try to press on the analysts of Centcom to correct their conclusions according to the "proposals or political situation."
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the ongoing investigation of Inspector General Pentagon, which was initiated after Centcom's complaints.
Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon speaker, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report because the investigation of the Inspector General is still continuing.
He stated, however, that "the experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the defence ministry welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has an impact on the scope of the question of whether the Americans led bombing in Iraq and Syria are successful (the verdict now declaring the increasing number of defenders).
However, last year's indictment raised questions as to the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to evaluate the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis sites.
Report criticism of the Islamic State has been reflecting conflicts for more than ten years when an analyst of Centcom's intelligence services, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper stating that the administration of President George W. Bushe - despite the opposition of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and spent only a little time thinking about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the Islamic state's intelligence services.
Last year, the authorities announced that the Hooker team had reached the conclusion that despite the public statement of opposition, the air strikes conducted against the Islamic state's refinery had not significantly weakened the financial resources of this terrorist group, as the group had built up temporary refinery and oil sales on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the finding was not transferred outside the central staff.
Commander Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized last year after many lawmakers sought the Senate's testimony by too positive an assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in Centcom.
The United States won the ground hockey in the fourth match in the row, so today will play a decisive match in the UK team
Katie Bam, in the battle against Japan, which ended winning 6:1, shot three branches, and the day after that for the American women's team of ground hockey, shot the first two branches of the match, in which America defeated India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five tracks in two matches are a great memory success, but Bam (27) said she wasn't sure if something like this ever happened to her.
"I have no idea," she said.
I don't belong among those who write their branches.
But he knows this: The Americans at the Olympic tournament are leading the 4th and they are the first in the group with Great Britain, which remained on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0.
Britain and the United States will be on Saturday in the last round of the first round.
Both teams qualified to the quarter and the game will decide which of the six teams will end in the first and second.
The team from the first place will for some time avoid the strong Danes who are in the head of the second group.
Whatever the Saturday game ends, the Americans here caused their surprise ride, four years after they ended up with 12 teams playing in London.
There was Bam on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took a hockey game on the ground hockey first when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at all.
The Olympiad escaped in 2008 because it did not reach the final match.
Then came the year 2012, when it didn't happen much to her or to members of her team.
Next year, the coach was appointed Englishman Craig Parnham and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the rate of work we have today.
We've made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam began the first half of the shooting of the branch known as closeness.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved to be surprisingly hard and kept score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then called in the middle and shot the ball in the white to get the Americans to lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last branch in half a quarter.
The removal of the American barrister, Jackie Briggs, who in each of the three winnings helped one brand was at least the first at the tournament.
She's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"Now we're in a good place," Parnham said, but how good it is, it's going to be the result of the Saturday match.
Zen trampoline in the middle of the Olympic line
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's an olympiad.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro, it is to feel sustained, indescribable and excited about competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic descent itself is a hot-rolled barbeque wheel that's passed by a swimmer, a gymnast, and a triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation at the front of the cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then it's Logan Dooley, too.
Dooley, the upcoming sweet woman with a doll in her face, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose name will sound in the homes in the main broadcast time between advertising and sponsoring events, if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even a screenwriter.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest in California fights for Olympic gold in jumps on the trampoline.
The Olympic Fire doesn't light up all the competitions anyway.
Away from the middle, a little in the shadow are sports that are not generally recognized: firearms, firearms, firearms, Badminton, taekvondo.
We'll always have success in a classic swim style - and we'll probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me point to the unmistakable charm of trampoline.
Although the jumps on the Olympic trampoline since 2000, when they were first introduced to games in Sydney, after 16 years of intervention, this sport remains almost unnoticed - many of the people I questioned didn't even know it was Olympic sport.
It can be a regional disaster.
The U.S. medals were never won in the trampoline jumps, and by 2012 none of the athletes even got to the finals.
Prices in the male category are usually shared between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year gold medals from London will cover Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
The jumps on the trampoline have yet another miscarriage, partly because the unencumbered ear will seem to be more suitable at the clown university than at the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, but just a soul-hunting from the ground.
It has a comic potential - a comical vibration of endless reflection - but also the warmth of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combine in itself.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish word "el trampoline", which means "skokanska board".
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline, which shoots them to a height of almost 10 meters and perform compositions with several elements (salt, heat and combination) before finally landing again on their feet.
According to the official Olympics programme, they are assessed according to implementation, difficulties and "air times".
In Rio, he will compete for twenty-seven athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual trail of the Olympic route is ahead.
The gold medal warriors have to move on, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, again and again, up and down.
Trying to reach not only the target tape or start-up wall, but also another line of thought: a world record or an Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, wonderful, a little fantastic - and enough for the spectators to lead to tears.
But I think it's a little exhausting when you're watching the Olympics.
Jumps to the trampoline in this regard bring the flow.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is heading up.
It doesn't make sense to move forward.
He or she reflects themselves as if they were in a state of no weight as astronauts, flying up, down, and down again without a lift up.
Without competition and, of course, no difficulty, but during the duration of the composition, there will be no fierce struggle to achieve goals, no measuring distance, but only perfect, smooth time and gravity.
This is only the closest when the olympiad and the zen are approaching.
Qualifications and finals of women take place on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock in the east time, then male competition on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will send the finals within an afternoon block that starts after both days in 14 hours.
In the middle of the Olympic madness, they promise a peaceful, pleasant moment that you will probably see through the other battles.
And if the attention is to be achieved only so that male athletes will be the subject of loving views and disappointments - as Wall Street Journal recently suggested by the gymnasium USA - then Logan Dooley is only waiting for his new fans who are crawling on the breath.
"Protesting Generation" in Ethiopia, long-term United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia have attacked the violent resistance of the government.
Witnesses claim that a lot of protesters were shot during the shooting with the police.
The threat of war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
Over the last few months, however, the country has been gripping with the anti-government problems that are spreading to more and more areas.
In the last few weeks alone, thousands of people have been forced into the streets, demanding fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was unmerciful.
The witnesses claim that the police have shot and killed representatives of unarmed demonstrators.
In rolling video recordings of protests likely from the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, security forces personnel are being arrested, as young people do after being forced to stand at the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now requesting a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to take a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, project leader Horn of Africa for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most indigenous nation in Africa and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia to eliminate the threat of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and many from African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has evolved at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved in a fundamental way - in Addis Ababa's capital is even driving a new suburban train.
And the streets of the cities are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, can hardly be described as a model of democracy - an organization fighting for human rights without standing speaks of government repression - opposition in the country was suppressed, dissidents were effectively silenced.
Many were imprisoned, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the wilderness.
But that can change.
"When people are angry and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakthrough," said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all young people.
He's been protesting the whole generation.
The complaints are many and are all about the ground-based disputes after absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After yesterday's elections, which have been widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies have won the last chair of the opposition and now controls 100 per cent in parliament.
At the same time, the pressure on the border with Eritrea increases. The conflict along this unexplained, controversial border requested hundreds of lives in June.
The analysts are afraid that separatist groups, which have been overpressed over the last few years, such as the Oromus Free Front or the Ugandan National Free Front, may try to use the confusion and rearm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why these bitter feelings have been heated again after years of flooding.
The first one seems to be harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks up to the last few years, when they have become commonly available cheaper phones and Internet services have improved.
And even if the government prohibits access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case during protests, many people can still communicate through the Internet proxy that hides the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians talked about how they gathered for protests.
There is further greater solidarity between Oromy and Amhary, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromas and the Amhars are not natural allies.
After the long years of Amharic, mostly from the Christian peaks of Ethiopia, they had a reputation for politics and commerce and used Oromas, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But it also changes.
"We are on our way to united leadership," said Mulat Gemechu, leader of Oroma.
The biggest protests were in the areas of Amharia and Oroma.
Many Amharians and Oromas feel that Ethiopia is not legally dominated by the Tigris ethnic groups, which make up about 6 per cent of the population and control the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for trouble is the death of Melese Zenawi.
Zenavi, the former leader of the rebels, was the Ethiopian president of the government for the entire 17 years until his death in 2012, when he suffered the undetected disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see through the corner.
Analysts say that especially masterly he managed to detect the initial signs of discontent and used the senders to manipulate and win the opponents on his side.
"The current regime loses basic consciousness," said Abdi, an analyst of the conflict.
The new President of the Government of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was expelled from relative ignorance with the aim of replacing Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemaria came from the south.
Analysts claim that he does not have confidence in the security services of the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be another blood flow.
Last year, in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts labeled as elections that the government picked up and then stole.
He followed a hard strike, during which many Protestants were killed - although less than in recent months - and this period of anxiety passed relatively quickly.
The development experts assessed the Ethiopian leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual rise in disputes within the Ethiopian government has not stopped it.
And there's dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, Gondar protesting in the city of Amharic attacked businesses owned by Tigers and the anti-Tigers on social networks are becoming more and more common.
Analysts say protests make the US and other Western allies uncomfortable.
The U.S. government uses Ethiopia as the basis for drone crossings over neighboring Somalia, even though it has recently declared that the base has been closed.
While the West wants to clearly support democracy, at the same time it does not want its associate to break down in such a permanent area.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and funding IS as "sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump, on Friday, tried to bagatize the latest controversy that flooded his campaign, declaring that he did not mean it, when several times this week he insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican candidate to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts himself in an unpleasant situation by his instigator who tried to defend him in a stormy time and must explain that he may not have thought his remarks seriously.
After this proposal for a Wednesday night meeting, Trump confirmed his statement on Thursday and continued in the talks that he really had no intention of saying that President and H. Clinton's IS had been created.
However, on Friday morning, Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The contribution was contrary to the claim of the old one only one day when Trump in several interviews said that he was serious about his accusation.
When conservative ad moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to calm down with Trump's remark that Obama was trying to destroy the IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes at a time when Trump has tried to focus his campaign on the economy while his preferences in pre-election surveys are declining.
Trump and Clinton took part this week in Michigan duel on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back on this topic.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to an increase in taxes, and he said her speech was boring.
Trump used his defense sarcasm earlier.
At the end of July, when he was criticizing the wave, when he came up with a proposal that the Russians should enter Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his note: "I am of course sarcastic."
This approach to Trump allows to push the boundaries of political declarations and reduce them as necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing to what extent some reports have responded to his beneficiaries to find out how they react, and then, in response to one or the other, "explained," said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who was watching the language that both candidates used.
But I also think that in his statements he's perverse and he knows that they're important enough to be able to explain them in different ways.
Because the results of pre-election research in its favor continue to decline, Trump has chosen even more expensive tone in recent days instead of reducing things for general voters.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is with a great distance behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close to her in Florida.
Trump is trying to avoid excuses for provocative sentences he says, but he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or for not understanding his sense of humor.
But along with Trump's increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have led to the unpleasant situation of his loyal stand, which must be publicly behind him, whatever his remarks are as provocative as possible.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Prime Minister of New York City, who is one of the most prominent Trump stairs, had to defend the candidate in the discussion for the CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he is saying is a legitimate political comment," Giuliani said when asked about Trump's credibility as saying that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that, before Obama, the IS was almost unknown, a small organization he called the novelty completely wrong, and it came to this because his army had arrived from Iraq.
Most of the ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that Obama's government, in which Clinton acted as a foreign minister, allowed the IS to prevail and failed to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania Trump, on Twitter, he continued to light a fire on the media because they were changing every word he said and are getting excited about it.
He spoke to “the humble, pathetic ” television students who try to understand him and said, “He can’t! ”
Several Democrats apologized to Trump for the fact that it was just another proof that he was not eligible for the presidential office.
The coffee shop has been pushed out of the price market. Now it's coming back to Greenpoint.
The Verb Cafe café was a rusty place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where the coffee was served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the house at Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a shop that Verb replaced in summer 2014 - sells soap in the form of cakes.
The locals complained about it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabpple on Twitter wrote: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is executed, and now from Verb is a trade by means."
But if New York's changed, then it's a rediscovery too.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and receives payment cards, but there are some of the original employees and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the original coffee shop, who is at the same time the owner and executive director of the new place.
In Verb he started in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of his clients offered to pay for the move to a new place, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left many things as they were.
Verb still has the same oven supplier and bought the same model machine on espresso.
Even again, he used lighting from the old verb.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new, too.
He started using new bets.
In the offer are sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings, such as caps and fried onion.
You'll also find a bunch of rice nuts here.
The coffee is no longer a beer, but it will offer you fresh fruit juice.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed the constant flow of original stem cells.
"A number of original customers from Williamsburg also had to move because of prices," he said.
Last week there was one of those clients, Rebecca Oliveirov.
Mrs. Oliveirová (34) lived in Williamsburg and used to go to Verb Cafe.
She even came when the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verba," she said.
Now he's drinking coffee again, but on that day, instead of his usual ice coffee, he gave himself a mixed chai, another novel.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term customer, has been on his way to Verb since 2003.
He goes before work and always orders the same thing.
"In the fourth and eighth days I will come here as watches, and I will be prepared for my cough with everything and with butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add to the offer of a new bet.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what's usual, but sometimes on his lips he lets all the bacon, eggs and ham.
Rodriguez said he's not sorry that the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is, Soap Cherie's owners offered him that he would make a special soap for Verb and use a filtered coffee from the coffee shop as a substitute.
"I think we could still use it," said Rodriguez.
The traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint's cafe also accepted well.
One of the new bidders translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon be exposed so that his new neighbors would feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
Local fruit growers want to stick into the bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will expand into a neighboring building.
A lot of customers have enough to get back their old favorite.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, his heart broke.
Mr. Whitt says when the coffee shop opened up again, coming in and getting coffee is like coming home.
"I missed that smell," he said.
Depressive food from the time of the crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after arriving at the president's office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval workshop and had lunch.
Labujnik President Roosevelt enjoyed selected meals from the 5th Avenue, as was the shepherd of the cattle cattle and the Maryland wheat harvest.
His menu on this day, however, was more modest: eggs in the devil's way in a paradise sauce, potatoes, and as dessert of a sweaty pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with people who were suffering," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message to Americans how they should eat."
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights is devoted to gastronomic history.
The last book of Andrew Coea "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the life story of the home on the Lower East Side through the food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal", which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of the American cuisine during the great economic crisis.
They themselves showed the cook's solidarity and met with the reporter at dinner in Eisenberg's shop with sandwiches, a small sleek buffet in the area of Flatiron, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and sandwich with dried olives, Andrew (57) gave himself a crocan, potato cheese and a vegetable mixture.
The reporter ordered a mass carbanate that, according to a couple, was very good at talking about food during the crisis.
"The cartoons were very popular," said Ms. Ziegelman.
He was selling buraca, liver, and pheasal carbanettes.
They were made from the mixture and other cheap foods that set the ingredients.
Stop the amount of ants you should have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe's getting sick.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, the American kitchen, especially in rural areas, was given the shape of a buffet of what you're dreaming of.
The women were cooking for workers from the farm and for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and a freshly baked cake.
They were the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" follows how the nation was balanced by not being a country of greed.
"It was the time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe explained in an explanation why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally alarmed: secret food, such as carbunettes and casserole foods, casserole as "a wonderful way to use the remains," Ziegelman noted, as the chefs could hide non-esthetic dishes under the cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Mass - after a long year, the central point of American food - has become a protracted luxury.
The strange jokes that should have served as caloric and nutritional fillings had a preference before taste or even a healthy sense of cooking.
During the research for a book containing recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a daily meal from a cooked onion filled with butter.
"It wasn't a favorite dinner table increase," said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman stressed: "It was surrealistic."
Bourá's butter with cooked onion is not going together.
It was typical for a lot of home recipes.
As never before and ever after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the sixth head of the federal household economy in 1923 to 1943 - guided the country’s feeding habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, called on women to take over the budget, and sleighs, such as cream spaghetti with carrots, turned into delicious foods.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical insights.
In particular, in response to the government's hungry citizens, such as President Hoover's post, I am "getting a cake".
While publicly praising the simple iow farm kitchen of his childhood, he stood as a chosen millionaire who became.
"He likes to eat a continental kitchen, like fish with chicken sauce," said Andrew Coe.
He ate in the almost-exposed room, he had a tuxedo on him.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistakes if his wife, Eleanor, did not accept him to be an example of his own stomach.
According to the book, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housewife who was not interested in the taste at all. This led to the White House "not having been given the most expensive food in the whole of Washington, but also in the most unpleasant way prepared."
A number of eating habits from the time of the crisis took off as soon as the earth was restored to its feet.
The link remained in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to cooking.
Some say that during the writing of the book they better understood the eating habits of Miss Ziegelman's mother - perhaps why she couldn't throw out food.
"She was really afraid of food spilling," said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman recalled: "It was bad for people."
There's been an accident with the vegetables.
When at Eisenberg's clean tables, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert that they prepared at home: the Swedish dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called Swedish cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes an elegant name.
There was no cream there, just sweats, a little milk, sugar, water and chicken.
Everyone reluctantly threw a spoon into a thick humid mass.
Surprisedly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a proper host, he said to his wife: "It would be a bit of dried hair."
Europeans: migrants go for doses.
Most refugees who flock to Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians are making fun of themselves.
That's how the show would look if we were to touch them.
A group of Russian artists, called 2D Among Us, is making fun of their home country.
With the help of a photoshop, they create collages that show a funny way of how it would look if the famous films and films were filmed in Russia.
Gilead has a claim for compensation for legal representation in the case of a patent against type C yellowishness against Merck Group
The judge of the periodic court decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to pay fees for lawyers who created it in the course of the patent against type C yellowing against Merck & Co Inc.
In June the judgment was annulled, according to which Gilead was supposed to pay 200 million for the damage caused by the infringement of two Merck patents in connection with the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal judge found repeated unlawful proceedings on the part of Merck, besides the lie under oath and other non-ethical practices.
On Thursday, Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated that Gilead had a claim for a decrease in the fees incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the new generation's drug market against type C yellow, which can cure more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates from 2013 when Gilead and Merck complained to each other and claimed to be the owner of the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead.
US-supported military units claim to have gained full control of the city of Manbij
The U.S.-supported military units gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic state fighters fled the city, he told the speaker group on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now examining the city after the departure of the remains of a group of radicals who were hiding in the city.
The units were released over 2,000 civilians who were radically detained, said Reuters Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbídje military council.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching for it," said the agency Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate 34.2 per cent
Hillary Clinton published his 2015 tax award on Friday, stating that the presidential candidate for the Democrats and her husband had an income of $10.75 million in that year and made a real tax of 34.2 per cent.
Clinton was awarded $1 million to charity in 2015, mainly to Clinton Foundation. President Bill Clinton contributed to the common cash of nearly $5.3 million for lectures, and the former foreign ministry granted $3 million to Simon & Schuster for its book on its role in the foreign ministry.
Clinton's co- Candidate, American Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, published a tax confession in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are still a model of financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmiera, who helped Clinton with the campaign.
Against that, Donald Trump hides himself for false excuses and withdraws from his earlier promises that his tax confession will be public.
It is common for candidates to publish their tax admissions to the president of the United States, even though they are not subject to the law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers quoted the audit of the U.S. Department of Finance's Department of Finance as the reason for his refusal to publish tax recognition.
"Your move," said Hillary Clinton's campaigner on Twitter and linked to the tax recognition of a democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, Special Trump's Advisor, said on Thursday CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax admissions until the audits are completed.
According to Trump’s criticisms, which include a Republican candidate for the President of 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, they agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profit, his contributions to charity, trade and other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is on the question and published a video on Friday, which reminds us of how high the position of the Republic of Trump is required to publish his tax admission.
On Thursday the question was mentioned in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other candidates have done to the presidential office after decades - to publish his tax admission," he said in front of people.
Politico said that Trump paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times publisher quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claim it can be the same today.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of the presidential election.
Clinton advocates a rule named after Warren Bufet's billionaire, which would ensure that all who make more than $1 million a year pay a minimum tax of 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet at Clinton's meeting in Omaz, Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax concessions.
Buffett said he also went through an IRS audit and that Trump was "not afraid" of the financial office, but of the volunteers.
Clinton's campaign published tax returns until 2007.
Clinton, who now lives in Chappaqua, New York, paid a federal tax of 32 per cent on average in 2007 to 2014 and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 per cent on average.
It follows from Clinton's tax recognition for 2015 that, unlike most Americans, they earn only $100 in their wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund from which Clinton was given income on dividends and interest of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or elephant fire extinguishers in Tanzania
Naturalists in Tanzania use a non-orthodox way to prevent elephants from walking into human settlements - throwing condoms filled with chilli powder.
This process was certified and the Honeyguide award, which came with the idea several years ago, along with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this process and schools volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, using this inviolable process to protect their homes and crops in four steps, without harming animals.
Many of them used copper to defend themselves.
Friday is a world day of elephants dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since the time they have developed this ... file of tools, we have recorded a change of behavior in these communities. People believe much more that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them,” said the executive director of Honeyguide Damian Bell’s donation in a statement.
The first and second steps are to light up the battery on the passing elephant and launch the clakeson.
If she does not do so, the so-called "chillie's dress" will be thrown out.
Chilli the powder mixed with salt with the petardo will be wrapped in the condom, and its end will be soaked to look at only the knots.
After the fire, the condom will explode and the soft powder from the chilli will spread into the air.
Most of the time, there's only one barrier, and the elephant is shown in a different direction.
The last option is the ignition of a fire extinguisher that triggers a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director went to the Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel for the "application" of the Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused an explosion in the media after finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin has no code for calling to Israel, according to the employee's words on the basis of the "requisite" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, author of a documentary on the Holocaust “Shoah”, ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel call code list.
However, the State has not been identified between countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and destroyed?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility of calling to Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and he was having a problem at the hotel reception.
The answer he received, Lanzmann says he was "shocking".
The hotel employee replied that the measure was "decided after the company's management of Kempinski Hotels".
The director's reason for this move was even more inflamed.
"Most of our guests are Arab and you asked for Israel's call code to be deleted," Lanzmann quoted the employee in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman referred to the case as "a lot of shame".
We were scared and shocked.
It's a huge shame to be alone.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and, in addition, in such a hotel chain is even more embarrassing.
There's no need for another explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event triggered a strong online reaction, people labeled it scandalous.
Some feel that Kempinski's hotel simply "lost" in the demands of Arab customers.
"Hanba to you," another contribution indicates that the hotel, which is located in Kurfurstendam's nobility street, stands near the synagogue.
According to the magazine Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dropped any charges by marking the event as a "survey" and an "excused" to Lanzman.
"Never a direct order was issued" does not include Israel in the call code list, quoted Suddeutsche Zeitung as the representative of the Kempinski hotel.
He adds that the call code was added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber missiles against protesting Brazilian students
The students and the police met in San Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday, when the students met for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police against the protestant used tear gas and rubber missiles.
The problem was solved when the government's order services tried to divide the students, which ended by the police using rubber projectiles and tear gas.
The demonstration was attended by several hundred students to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the Governor of San Paulo Gerald Alckmin to save money is the closure of nearly a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were able to see how they were adopting written statements against the provisional President Michel Temer.
The latest protest is coming only a few days after the demonstrators were sent to the streets to support President Dilmy Rousseff's meeting when the senate in the country decided on her complaint.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 % - RT Business
According to the Russian embassy in Iran, Levana Dzhagaryan has increased its trade turnover by 70.9 percent after the sanctions between Moscow and Tehran were abolished.
As the ambassador stated, since the abolition of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest by Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Another expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagarianan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period for 2015 and reached US$ 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran amounted to 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The growth in trade has ensured supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagarian also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued approximately 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly travellers.
In addition, Iran first got between top 20 countries according to the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It can certainly be said that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia will be overcome from last year," he said.
At the same time, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the memories of ancient Persian civilization are well preserved," he said.
Scott Callum Skinner rushes home after the British get gold in the cyclist
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the night before dawn in a male sprint team at the velodrum in Rio, when the three VB team defended the title from London 2012.
A 30-year-old relative from Glasgow was in the role of the brake that he took for his Scott Sir Chris Hoy, and a young legend pleased him when he reached his goal and stole the victory from the hand of a favorite New Zealand.
Britain won a surprise four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick was repeated after the end of the humble sixth World Championship in a career career in March, even though Hoy ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was replaced by Jamie Staff's specialized instigator.
Hindus just showed up in time.
After leaving Hoye also set free a place that tried to fill the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and looking for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindus, who was with Hoy's champion four years ago, and Skinner reached the Olympic record at the qualifications, but he took his shirt in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio got gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind his bike, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
Changing the strategy was a major part of the transformation when Hindus went to higher translation to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to hold the pace.
Hoy was watching from his BBC commentary position, and when Skinner, Kenny, and Hindus went out on stage, he didn't let them out of his sight.
Thirty-nine-year-old Skinner, a relative from Glasgow, said, "It's a lousy comparison."
I'm here to get the best of myself and honor my name.
We created an Olympic record at the finals and beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After the victory next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindus admitted that he was on the road successfully after a bad start.
The note was later withdrawn, and the British opponents had no option to withdraw.
This time there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindus said: “With all these British flags on the courts, I felt like I was in London.”
In the last three months, we've all been together as a team.
We lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be the indicator of progress in the past five months, then we have a successful five days waiting on the highway.
In the form that Kenny introduced, it's not impossible to repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same time.
It would then be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy - also has the birthday of March 23rd (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, this day also celebrates the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - it meant a total of six gold medals and one silver medals.
No matter how much Hoy got.
As another, Kenny will participate in a sprint that starts today and lasts another three days.
An 18 - year - old relative from Bolton said: “I now enjoy this.
Team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindus said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knight's title."
It was the only medal competition that day, but the British were waiting for another good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doul qualified as the fastest to reach the race for four kilometers.
Ended at 3:51,943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and finals (2:42) are taking place today's second day of the race, to which the dose manager will focus on Wiggins.
Yesterday before the qualifying competition, he was discussing with the Commissioner when her judges called on her to measure the height.
In a similar race of women, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavie reached the world record of 4:13,260.
The VB team relied on its strong team of career cyclists and controlled the mid-term Olympics and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, which showed absolute superiority in Beijing and in London, the expected decrease in the preparation for Rio was observed.
In the background, dramatic events took place, in the last line of the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to charges of sexism and discrimination, and the termination of the career of the grandioses, such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of the race at the Velodrum shows, the legendary reputation seems to be that the UK team can deliver peak performance with perfect timing, so it can be confirmed again.
There is no future of a tavern in Portland after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland tabernacle of the clay in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is not due to the electricity that the company supplies the electricity and which informed one of the owners of the tabernacle's contract about the supply of electricity. It is expected that all contracts on the supply of electricity will be cut short.
This step takes place after the Victorian government has decided earlier this year that it does not extend the supply of grants that the company maintains in progress.
The validity of a fixed 20-year grant will expire in November.
The Alcoa Portland company may be in danger of up to 2000 jobs.
At the time of closure, up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect.
And since the tavern consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, it can have other venous effects.
Alcoa closed Point Henry's tavern in 2014, which led to the closure of England's power plant last year.
Alcoa's tavern in Portland is formidable and threatens to close it.
This step follows several speculations about the future of the company, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and in recent times due to prices for the production of the race.
AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the valley of Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects some of the other three owners to conclude the contract as well.
Most of the company's owners are Alcoa and Alumina, small business shares hold the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the portland race to continue to function, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the tabernacle will continue," she said.
AGL stated that the contracts were so-called "insurance contracts", which were to enter into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month reporting period, so their validity will actually end in 2017.
‘AGL continues to assume that the contracts will be divided into profit for fiscal year 2017’, the power plant declared.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits from fiscal year 2018 is further limited at present due to the strong outlook of the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL stated that it had already written a value of $187 million in its book of account "in case it would end."
Alcoa stated that the conclusion of the contract decision "has no effect on its ... ability to operate a tent or to secure the supply of electricity to the tabernacle."
The US company stated that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to start paying since November of this year, even though it still had to explain why the contract ended.
The analysts are very careful with regard to the possible closure of the portland tavern in Victoria and the Tomago race near Newcastle as a result of a poor sector economy.
AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said that Portland annually consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity and around 900 megawatts.
If both companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the market [electric energy].
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the real TV show Kardashian - now is the cover of the star Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of the mother-managers of the Klan Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the title page of the September issue of the U.S. Vogue magazine.
Kendall, the Ambassador of the Estee Lauder brand, who held the fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when looking at this title page," Kendall wrote.
The opening of the title page was followed by a bizarre (or simply humourous continuation in Kardashian?) scened video, in which the entire family of Kardashian-Jenners (Baroque rapists Rob and Caitly and with them all the favorite showboys, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). On their sister's cover, they forgot only so that the scene could end with a classic turn: they prepare a secret party.
It's a protected history line for almost every "born" part of a children's television show (Seacrest says: "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the honesty of the painted king in the eight o'clock in the morning), but Christ needed to make sure that other girls could live on this advertising.
Because when we look at the September issue of the Vogue magazine, we are sure to enter the new era of Kardashian.
Senior sister Kim may have Kendall pressed on Vogue's cover (she was on it together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the September issue of the magazine is another league.
The magic edition of the Vogue magazine is the most sold all year round.
The edition, which is more like a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a whole series of ads (Fashionist estimated that 615 pages with advertising content were out of 832 pages in last year’s edition).
The discovery of the star that appears on the title page is unmistakably expected, so it is not surprising that in the past two years the photographs of the magazine have been avoided even before its official publication.
Among the women who appeared in the past on the cover are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist or Kate Moss.
In recent years, the title page has, of course, revealed more "celebrities that make models" than "models that are celebrities."
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar's holder and Ambassador of the Dior brand, appeared on the title in 2013, a year later she had the honour of Lagy Gaga.
But even though it is very unlikely that Kendall, whose magazine describes as her generation's "problem model", will fall into the first category, will be in a very good company.
These celebrities are not related to known people, nor the stars of reality shows, or children today who know how to make well-cut videos (even though Jenner represents all this).
They're obviously talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the title page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career thanks to the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria's Secret model in June, criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "girls for a moment".
These feelings were once again heated up by the report that Jenner was appearing on the Vogue envelope.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner's on the cover of the shining Vogue.
It's a supermodel in the right word of meaning.
He's acting for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you make-up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves to their own payrolls.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter who took pictures of the magazine Love.
And in free moments it works in reality show, maybe just as one way to see Courtney and her kids.
Community Legal Centres for Annual Disposal of 160 000 People
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are denied legal aid in Community centres each year, and in the sector itself they are going to be affected by further restrictions on the financial resources for the already overcompensated services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, the threat of workers, victims of violence and people without financial means - are already refusing to seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community law services, which are already so keen to break up, are going to be more difficult.
From June next year, these legal aid centres will attract another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The director of the Community Legal Assistance Centre in Queensland, James Farrell, said that according to the latest summary report, the National Association of Community Legal Assistance Centres found that five thousand people were refused each year.
Mr. Farrell said that without cancelling the federal government's decision, the situation would worsen.
"The Community legal centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have avoided relations with a rapist, people with excessive and protective debts, families that are going through divorce, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not have the opportunity to get the help they need.
Since June 2017, the federal government has reduced funding by 30%, leading to the fact that thousands of people at risk from Queensland will have to be targeted in complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the State Representative and Senator George Brandise to prevent this short-term funding from getting people the help they need when they get into legal problems.
In the past year, the government has been committed to ensuring the financing of legal aid to the extent of the international average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the community's legal aid centres and the community of their clients and the Palestinian government must invest in this important work.
Complaint against Donald Trump's campaign after a member of the board allegedly targeted the weapon
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued for alleged inaction after they were told that the director of operations in North Carolina in February directed a gun to a staff member during the trip to the jeep.
The incident was described in the court file that Vincent Bordini, a former software teacher of the state campaign, handed over to the State on Wednesday at the Charlotte State Court.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he concluded that "it will not happen".
The director of Earl Phillip "set his finger on the gun, gave a right indicator on the trigger and directed Vincent's head to the Czech," Bordini stated in the complaint.
According to the list, Bordini found that at least four other people had the same experience with Phillip after the local and regional leadership complaint.
"The weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini stated in the complaint.
The complaint comes only two days after the Republican candidate for the president has raised a raise when he told the North Carolina voters that they could move forward the owners and holders of the weapon (which is amended in the second addition to the constitution) if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and he could name his judge.
Trump's campaign says the media ran out of context and Trump didn't watch out for violence.
Bordini, in the complaint, seeks compensation from the campaign for neglecting supervision and from Phillip for endangering personal security, unlawful use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump's speaker, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to the request for a comment.
Trying to get a statement from Phillip was a failure.
WCCB, a local intelligence department in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
No one has responded during a short time to contact his advisory company.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump runs a controversial pre-election campaign.

Britain must expand its Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of recovery and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is enormously attractive, just as it was in London in 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to compete from the Olympics.
The Olympics marked a huge contribution to Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again so we can create opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we create 10,000 new schools, 40,000 new jobs, and we end up with the unemployment of young people around the airport.
Just like before the 2012 London Olympics, there are those who will think that the expansion of Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be prepared for the Olympics and that we would laugh at the world stage.
The suspects were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out they were not right.
Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that is shared by many people and companies, not only by a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion libre, to leave heritage in the form of skills and employment both in the airport and in the UK as a whole.
We have a great team on Heathrow, who, in time and with the budget set up an infrastructure investment programme of 11 billion pounds, starts with a T5 terminal - which was chosen by the best terminal in the world five years ago, after a T2 terminal, which was built between the two most devastating wounds in the world.
They are now ready to add a third wound, which is worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The games in London in 2012 were a huge success for Britain and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow will also be.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, secure business in the future, and abandon the legacy of skills and jobs that Britain may be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is President of the Board of Representatives and a former Deputy Minister of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game on the cat and mouse in blocking advertising
From the attempts to round up advertising blocking programs, for companies that make online marketing, it became a game on the cat and mouse. At least it claims one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus on its pages published a contribution stating that users can update filters in their program and re-block advertising on this social network.
Facebook stated on Tuesday that his desktop website will change the coding around advertising to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the website are advertising.
But now Adblock claims that the new codes have already been covered.
Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote in a blog that "this kind of war between the open source blocking community and those who try to hug it lasts from the time the blocking was found," and that Facebook is likely to come with another own repair.
The fact that the company owning the largest social network in the world has been involved in war only proves how major a problem has been the blocking of advertising for industry.
According to the study, last year, Pagefair and Adobe have been using advertising filters around 200 million people worldwide - almost four times as long as it was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of the Facebook advertising profits, every day Facebook from mobile devices will visit 1.03 billion active users.
The speaker stated, however, that the company goes against advertising filters on the desktop because mobile advertising filters on mobile applications for the social network and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on the desktop still represents a profit so high that Facebook decided to invest in it.
Facebook also announced on Tuesday that it will update the "ad preferences" tool to enable people to better control how ads appear.
On Thursday, Facebook announced that Adblock's new filters are concerned because they could also block content that does not relate to advertising.
“It’s not a pleasant experience for people, and we want to solve this problem,” Facebook spokesperson stated in an e-mail statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, and that's why we'd rather focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
A woman hit a car at the Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the street in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses of an event in which, on Thursday morning, several vehicles were taken over by a woman who was probably trying to commit suicide.
An accident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
The Vaud police stated in a statement that the actor "zoufalado" was lying in the dark on the road and passing it several cars.
It's clear that the victim, a woman at 49, wanted to kill herself and hit several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but according to the police, not all of them have been identified yet, and the police are calling on these drivers and all of the others who have witnessed accidents to report.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation such as this, legal representative Gilles Hofsetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the participating drivers will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent an attack?
This has to be found by the plaintiff," Hofsetter said.
Based on two similar cases over the past five years, drivers do not seem to be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was about the person going on the road - it was decided that the motorists could not expect the pedestrians who were crossing the road in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year the police officer was acquitted of the death of the illness after she met and killed a man lying on the A1 road near Paynerner in August 2014.
The court found that at the age of 22, the victim drank alcohol and went off the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was in an appropriate manner and that the presence of a man on the road was "a very exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information on the quarterly incident that occurred at Morges should report to the police on the telephone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant town.
Prague is the favorite destination of the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Offices and Agency (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague to come within Prague.
On Friday, it was announced by the Executive Director of AČCKA Katerín Petríčová.
The sixth anniversary of Prague Pride began on 8 August, the festival approximates the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Praha belongs to the most popular destination of the LGBT community, which is for a high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialised companies," Petríčová said.
According to the survey, foreign visitors at the festival lose on average 3100 crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists are available to support their travel to Prague special maps with a complete list of Prague gays and gay-friends bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps etc.
"For travel generally, LGBT customers are very lucrative, interested in staying in higher price relations with high standard travel services and losing more than others," Petríčeková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is also under the programme of the festival this year.
It is presented by experts from the LGBT travel sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14th.
The main theme of this year is love, but events will also be devoted to several thematic areas, including family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The top of the festival will be a traditional route with allegorical cars from Václav Square to Summer.
The reason that thousands of people have attended last year is to observe a minute of the silent memory of the victims of the June attack in the Orlando Night Club, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt are celebrating for forty years.
The unresolved cultivator Pat and Matt, whose effort usually ends with disaster, has enjoyed small and large spectators for 40 years.
The pilot's part of this evening's series by Director Lubomír Beneše was premiered on 12 August 1976.
Following the creation of this animated series, which now knows spectators in more than a hundred countries of the world, jokes were drawn by the artist and director Lubomír Benesh, who designed the magazine with two boxes of Mr. Ogolíčka and Sedleč.
Benesh then called for the collaboration of the dramaturg Jiří Kubíčka and author Vladimir Jiránka and together created a film by Kučáci.
Today, with a yellow and red trick and a bullet and a radio, they received the works in 1979, when he began to create a series for Slovenian TV in the short film Prague.
The names Pat and Matt were then given in 1985, this time it was already directly for the Short Film of Prague.
In 1990 Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of the animated AIF Studio in Prague and Curychu, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creations, many of which were shared by Benelux’s son Marek.
At present, there are over ninety episodes of the stories of these corners, which all sleep under their hands, but never get angry at themselves and are always full of optimism, ideas and cuticle enthusiasm, and finally they are content with their work, which shows a familiar gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat even moved from television to books, to DVDs and to theatres and other toys with Pat and Mata images are the target of every toys.
A story for Fiji and two years of harmony.
At the end of the week, we've chosen one sport and one of our lives for you.
They both have a good ending.
Let's see.
Fiji has achieved its historic success.
What is the cause of the joy of the whole earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and she's happy with her.
And for what things do people spend the most on airports?
It's a Friday review from the world's websites.
The first medals from the Olympics.
The historic success of Fiji is celebrated by the island state.
Ragby's choice of this co-sponsor defeated the final Olympic tournament of the seven-year-old team of the United Kingdom.
It's the first medal Fiji won for herself at the Olympics.
Waiting for the winning of the first precious metal lasted sixty years since the first expedition to the Olympics.
A great credit for the success of Coach Fiji.
It's ironic, though, that it's Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the finals what the British citizen could have been satisfied with unlike his countrymen.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can win the biggest game in our history," the coach told the finals.
Fiji has finally sovereign power and a small state with 900 thousand inhabitants is now experiencing the Olympics.
The news was brought by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and luck for a little girl.
Two years of Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who's been living without a hand for 11 months, and her leg's got a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mommy, she's like me," the two-year-old girl rejoiced as her mother made up for ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to sleep her hands and legs and then sits down together without a prosthetic.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis in a few years of life, and it was given by doctors only a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny and she never gives up.
He's got surveillance.
I saw her look like the other kids with the words Hi, I'm Harmony and I don't have a hand, my mother added.
Look at the joy of the bride.
What do we spend the most on the airport?
CNN brings a finding that people at airports lose most of their packaging water.
The Hudson's travel essential stores network has published data for the last year, where it contains 10 products that customers in its airports buy most frequently.
The water was a sovereign first.
The drinks were generally very popular, and in the first ten, eight were placed.
The ninth place was packed with large M&M beans with coconut flavor.
And can you figure out who's closing the first 10?
No food can be eaten as one of the above.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The Sovereign of the Universe.
We're just gonna win, Murray and Bond laugh.
The Veslars Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand sovereignly rule the categories of two without the riders for seven years and confirmed their domination in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the two went to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and since 2009.
At the Rodriga de Freitase camp in the quarter final, they scored 69th in a row.
What else are we in?
We're just nicer, Murray's already yelled during the Olympic regatta when he was supposed to answer questions about the domination of the New Zealand twin.
Frankly, we don't do anything different to the others.
We just practice hard, hard hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their powers are remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is a nearly two-metre and stochial clock, academically looking at Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
Besides, they have a different nature.
Bond studies and dedicates himself to finance, Murray has, for example, a charity boxing game.
That's why she doesn't spend much time together.
Eric's on board, basically, with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just gonna win.
I have a tendency to think about what might be shown, he admitted Bond, who, even at a press conference, deliberately assumed that the dominant in the crew was Murray.
He always answered as the first one, and Bond was waiting for his chance.
But on the water, the rivals destroy the calm force.
They're running their pace, and although often in the middle of the track they're not in the head yet, at their gradual acceleration, the opponents have not found a recipe yet.
We run on a two-kilometer track, and we never wanted to go the first mile up.
We're just trying to run a pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, four decades old Murray said.
With his four-year-old younger partner, he won seven gold medals for the world’s championship.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both were members of the gold fours without a corrugated.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to switch to two without a steering wheel.
At the London Olympics, most of their careers were probably opened and the Dominants confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it would be damn hard, and we had to make sure that we were mentally good, Murray said.
We know that all of us want to get out of the throne.
We've got that target on our back.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, given.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute of Space Studies developed a model for exploring Venus using instruments and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine if ever on Venus, the surface of which is hot, water-free and CO2-sucked, could be subject to conditions similar to conditions on Earth.
Scientists have already suggested that the low speed of turning Venus can explain its dense atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, however, Venus once seemed to be proud of a rare atmosphere similar to the Earth and then turned slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
On the planet, the areas were probably dryer than on Earth, but at times there was enough water and geographic diversity to control life and provide protection against rapid detachment.
Venus was also used by the sun, which was 30 percent darker.
"In the simulation of the GISS Venus model during slow rotation, it presents its day-to-day side to the sun almost two months at a time," explained a scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This is the way to heat the surface and create rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds that are treated as rain and the surface protect from excessive solar heat.
The result is climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than at present on Earth.
The model made up the story of Venus similar to the evolution that planetary scientists had previously hypothetically made.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over billions of years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans were cooled, and the water springs were burned with ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen escaped and remained only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of glass gas -- that's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy signed up for the Colorado Avalanche team coach post
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday to his post as coach and vice president of the team's hockey operations Colorado Avalanche, as a reason why he could not participate in the decision-making process on team issues.
The Executive Vice-President/General Manager Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed a step and stated that the club is starting to look for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have acted as chief coach and vice-president of the hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," said forty-year-old Roy in a statement.
For a long and intense time, I've been thinking about how I can improve the team, give him the depth he needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of coach and vice-president of hockey operations be in line with the vision of the organisation.
It must also have the opportunity to participate in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his team's benefits.
"Patric informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him a lot of happiness in the future.
Roy was nominated for Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to the profit of 112 points and first place in the Central Division. Colorado, however, had met Minnesota in the first round of play-offs and during the last two years he had not always won the season.
The Avalanche team reached score 39:39:4 in 2015/2016 and missed five points to get a second wild card at the Western Conference.
The company Roy, who enrolled in the Sino of Glory, won Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Employees on the oil surface in the North Sea renew talks and interrupt the situation
The top representatives of the parties acting stated that the reports for the salaries for workers of the oil area in the North Sea were interrupted, while all the parties to the dispute were in a new round of negotiations.
At the events against the Wood Group oil field service company, sporadicly took place on the North Sea area, which is operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the United Nations and RMT committee organisations can confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for resolving the current disagreements," the statement states.
It starts next week and we'll have a couple of weeks of a whole-day meeting, where we'll try to look at the problems from the new angles.
According to the trade union organisations, their recent actions, which, according to their words, were the first in more than 25 years, to protest against wage cuts up to 30%.
Wood Group this year reduced its rates and paid its suppliers in the North Sea by about 9% less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the rates of companies is due to a 10 % reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that other companies would provide space to deal with a market decline.
On the other hand, Shell disbursed thousands of people's payrolls and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries due to the modernisation of its processes - immediately after the mega fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the UK's June decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a member of Parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with committee speakers to discuss one of the biggest job conflicts of the entire generation, which led to a situation in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as he said, is vital for the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for all, not just for some," the statement stated.
For comparison, in 2016, almost $1.4 billion of investment in new projects in the North Sea is expected, while the average over the past five years was about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in Pleiades
The latest mission of Kepler's Space Telescope to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list of the speeds of turning stars from Pleiade Star.
New data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the constellation are at different speeds, and how the time of rotation is related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even its history in its solar system," said Luis Rebullova, a research worker at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena in a new report.
The Pleiades Star is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster now reach the state of maturity and have been born over 125 million years.
Now it's turning as fast as possible.
At maximum speed, these adult stars release a huge amount of star winds.
Because these winds are moving along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the age of the star, its speed of rotation is slowed down.
Kepler measures the speed of the rotation of each star so that it measures the time between the discovery of distinctive points on the stars -- similar to the sun's orbit.
According to the latest data on the speed of rotation, larger stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebullova compares stars to dancers, making pirates slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" Pleyad we see that the slowing stars are more massive, while the quickest ones are usually very light stars," Rebullova said.
Because Pleiade's star purchase is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of the stars and the speed of rotation.
"The shields give us the anchor for theoretical models of the star rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars," Rebullová said.
There's still a lot we want to learn about when and why the stars slow down their turn speed and say, "He's hanging his dance shoes on a mushroom."
Rebullová and her colleagues have described in detail the latest analysis of the speed of the turn of Plejad in three studies that will soon be published in the journal Astronomical Journal.
Is the qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then wouldn't the qualification agreement be closed and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after the exam without applying for special education?
It seems to me that in the field in which I want to work, the job is now free in some distant hospital, but about a year and a half, it could be released to another place where I would like to work.
So I don't know how the situation around her is going to solve, but the question continues.

No legislation imposes no obligation to enter into a qualification agreement with an employer - hospital.
The Qualification Agreement is a legal institution governed by a labour law and may be concluded between an employee and an employee in order to ensure the reimbursement of the costs incurred in connection with the increase or deepening of the qualifications of an employee.
In the field of health, a long-term pressure on the non-conclusion of these agreements has been developed in order to ensure the mobility of health workers and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Law No. 95/2004 Sb., the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional qualifications and specialised qualifications for the performance of medical examinations by a doctor, a dentist and a pharmacist, are expressly applicable, whereas participation in special education is considered to be a deepening of qualifications (not an increase in them).
This means that a qualification agreement may be concluded under the labour law only if the costs reach at least 75,000 CZK.
No legislation nor imposes the obligation to apply to special education.
The law only lays down the conditions for the application for inclusion in the field of specialisation education.
However, your doctor is authorized by law to perform your doctor’s appointment by completing the required course of education, even if the conditions are laid down by law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized qualifications in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation where professional practice in another field of specialisation may be included in the doctor’s specialisation training if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the hostage situation.
However, given that I do not know the circumstances of this case, consultation with the relevant Committee of the Ministry of Health (the Committee on Science and Medical Calls) can be recommended, since the Ministry of Health provides advice and consultation services related to the classification and duration of specialized education.
The advisory service shall also be provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, which must be a member of each doctor.
Syrian Halab doctors are asking for U.S. intervention.
The United States has not made any efforts to end siege (the rest of the city by government forces) and has not used its influence to protect civilians, quoted from the letter addressed to the White House of the AFP.
"We do not need tears, sympathy, and even prayers; however, we desperately need to create over the eastern Halab without flying zone to stop attacks, and we need international action to ensure that halab will not be reoccurred," the doctors said.
The Russian forces that support the army's faithful President Bashar Asad announced that he will stop every day for three hours in the Halabu area to allow safe passage to humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 till 12:00 SELČ are to be stopped all military activities, air strikes and gunfire.
The chief of humanitarian operations of the United Nations Stephen O'Brien welcomed it, but stressed the need for at least a two-day perspective.
In Obama, according to the AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors who act in the eastern part of Halab are already in control of the rebels.
It says that during the five years of war, witnesses were violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world looks at and finds how complicated Syria is, but it's only doing little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation by the Syrian regime and Russia sound like a slight threat, have been raised by pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
The doctors indicated that 42 attacks were reported in Syria last month, 15 of which were reported in the hospital where they worked.
We are most sad that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
Little children come to us with such serious injuries that we have to choose between them who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, the doctors tell us.
Two weeks ago, four newborns were drowned when the explosion interrupted the oxygen supply to their incubators.
They were breathing and then their lives ended - before he could really start, they remembered.
The army entrusted to President Bashar Asad, supported by the Russian forces, surrounded the rebellion in recent weeks by a controlled eastern part of Halabu, was inundated without food supply to more than 200,000 people.
The rebels who are under constant attack from Russia and Syria managed to break up and start anti-offensive on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides then arrived in the city and surrounded by forces.
