"The MRI scanner is based on an effect on physics called DNA confession (NMR), which was discovered in the 30s of Flix at the Rock (when he served at the University of Stanford) and Edward Percell (from Harvard University)"
In that confession, a magnetic field and radio galleries cause the atoms to evacuate small radio signals.
For example, in 1970, Raymond Damadian, a doctor and a scientist, discovered the basis for the use of a genetic conception as a medical examination.
