He said that his stand was suffering from the abuse of the PDP government in Bauchi, which had helped the end to succeed in the 2019 ’ s, and he gathered to depart from the community and returned to the APC area.
A major reason why I was freed was the PDP’s way of governing in Bauchi.
Everyone knows how drowsy I have been in the election of the governor of the state where the oldest minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed, was beaten by my dietary governor, Mohammed Abukah.
Now, though, there are nine more of the total conquests in the Bala government.
Instead of staying in PDP, I was given the right to take off, returning to my place.
Guarantee wrote a departure letter from the PDP sent to the director of his menu society, Bogoro C, after Bauchi.
Finally, he said that as he used to show the rest of the governors where they inherited and where they were to be repaired, he was not anointed and handed over.

The NAFDAC similarly set out certain rules and regulations for the treatment.
The intensity of the drugs was to be tested in animals at the first time.

APC Arranged the Neighbourhood Governor and the Ministerial Training at the University — Leadership of Hausa Newspapers.
In an APC public announcement, the National Assembly accused Governor Neja, Alhaji Bello, and the faculty of civil strife.
The document, which was the head of the Ingine Republic, Muhammad Jibrin Imman and the Secretaries of the East Muhammed Liman, explained that for six years the State’s nation had not received 512 million.
The document continues to say, the meeting that the governor called the water and the midwives, which on the night of the end of the previous week, will help to keep the campaign on, as you say, in writing to the Society’s secretary, has failed to see what has continued to happen in the country.
According to Enginea Immam, “We understand the Governing Body of Neja has struggled to distribute the capitals of the public by means of the preparation of a non-basic, water and central collection, because any verdict on the presidents of the media is written to the secretary of the media, so that they can search.”
He continued to say that for six years, a total of 512 million people in the community.
He said that what he understood as the government to be in a failure committee, which was set up on July 25, 2020, which was supported by the head of the failure to cooperate in the preparation of the problems between the member states and the coafe-corafencing court.
Whether we pay for social services, other activities related to social security, professional divisions and other social security problems, such as medical care fees because of the lack of access to government aid, not a legally executed public authority, we challenge all of us to justify the settlement of social law.
As I have explained, the most important part of the country that we had in the country with the constituent committees and committees now held in all of the two and a half governments in the country, which had been killed in the same country.
In this way, it is a mistake for each person to be sentenced to death on the basis of lawlessness, almost injustice and verbal abuse, by giving a committee to investigate how he or she was killed and set up.
Out of the seats of the court officer, the accused accused was a court who had failed to give, and there were no others like that, so I challenged all in this matter that brought his testimony to confirming his accusations in any way.
We have stood up against the APC State party from the U.S. witchcraft, the U.S. or the company from that retired society, and he has been unable to say that any publicist abuse or president of the State's action will be written on a committee that supervises the organization's operations, as shown in section 21 (B) (b), (d) on page 82 of the Community system.
Thus, the massive waters and the centers of the community have no trauma, especially if they have had a taste of the committees, so that the sentence has no effect.
For this reason, they are the most reliable presidents of the State, on 21st and 6th paragraph, on page 87 of the Society’s statute, no other usual.
Because of the decision to decide whether to love or not, you have made mistakes.
He said that the candidates you presented together with the consent to be held on the three days of the unfinished meeting, which was held by the Gulf, the Muhammed Garba General, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Abraham Balarabe, and all the committees, were not members of the Social Security Committee in the state.
The Committee on the Juveniles of Waters and the Central Community was the head of the Inginas Mohammam Community that he would not defend his governmental authority to undermine the political leaders.
The document was reluctant to say, the Governor of the Bello Sanctions recalled that the issue was the fulfillment of the nation’s vow during the time of the noon, as well as the travel with the public parents in the government by the way everyone could benefit in the state where all the programs were made by political means, which was the problem of a government and a civil society.
The document commends the members of the Society’s association rules for attending the meetings and focuses on making peace on all the problems of the community, and this is not surprising for court officials who are aware of their own illness, who are willing to accept annulment as a public law.
Hence, the head of the State’s rival committee was required to distract the government of Sani Bello on the right role to resist the erosion of the politics of the State.
Nigeria’s right - hand engineering in Internet - Freedom Radio Nigeria
Dr. Isa Ali, Pantami, says that this country is ready to be used in the transformation of the internet economy.

The dangers of food shortages in Nigeria are also the health care of people.
Some scientists have advised people to avoid eating foods that are used to prevent foods from being corrupted by such foods as health care.
This warning was followed by research on the crafts of food used in this country.
The results of the research show that there are other foods that are given to them in order to prevent them from drowning.
The survey also showed that the unique use of these symbols, the algae and the grasslands that are commonly spoken of for the public, is the most common use.
It is used because when a person sees the desire to use it, he is eager to do so.
Then eating food that is sensitive to this scandal causes disease, coronary disease, heart disease, and so forth.
The people of that country were called to pay attention to protecting themselves from the use of a variety of goods for their health care.
If not forgotten, Grace Olasumbo called the Nigerians to refrain from eating the cleaned vegetables with the calcium Carbide.
Olasumbo explains that calcium Carbide is the most commercially venerated pottery that is used to shave the woods, that is, the luxuries.
Examining evidence shows that the necklaces and necklaces of the marketplace are used in the form of the olive tree in a day - to - day manner.
Olasumbo explains that one thing that some businesses fail to understand is the use of this song to show interest in the welfare of others.
As a result, we were treated with mutilation - related diseases, eye disease, insecticides, mushrooms, mouth, and so forth.

Some public representatives of the Republic would be present in Charlotte, North Carolina, to shoot Trump on August 24.
Trump said that he would accept the talk in a different setting.
Trump, who has taken months, reflects the attitude or the care of the influence of the plague, which in recent times says that 99 percent of the cases of malaria and diseases in U.S. may have been very rare.

Towards the Conquest and Food — Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the spirit of the life of all creation, which can only be life - sustaining.
That is why the Chinese authorities were in a position to secure the nation’s wealth and food.
Over the past 71 years since the fall of the Chinese Republic, the country has gained great victories in the areas of food supplies, which have given the world the splendor of the population of the country, which has shown the number of Chinese on the basis of the religions, in the case of 1.4 billion.
This struggle has helped the pressing issue that led to the dismantlement of the world’s hunger, just as the head of the State of Sin Zhang Wufeng has reportedly explained that, from 1949 until now, China has always put the issue of famine in front of all the activities of the country’s journeys.
In recent times, however, some people and others have renamed the Western World’s news on the issue, which means that the Chinese country can raise its nation and its own index in the CEVID 19 pandemic shadow of the world?
We are very grateful to them that they regularly care for the existence of the New Testament in this world.
In the province of the Communist Republic of China, the country succeeded in obtaining enough food for the man in the struggle.
The matter of making available enough food to the Chinese is among the mainstream generals of the Governing Council of the United Nations.
In the end of the previous week, JCS secretary, head of China, X Jinping gave an important command to break food, suggesting that everyone knows that all food and work habits are available.
Although in this year COVID-19, the world’s environmentally friendly disease, was also a source of harm to the Chinese economy, but the Chinese country could provide enough food for its nation.
Alkalun, which was released by the Chinese Ministry for Agriculture, especially in this year of 2020, showed that the population of the country in the early part of 2020, amounted to 27 million.29 million, which was estimated at 1.08 million tons, 3.9% compared to the year 2019.
In fact, Ke Bingsheng, the old head of the Chinese farming college, says that Chinese had a large success in evacuating wealth from food when the purpose of moving from house to house was first described.
Huang State, the director of the field study of the Chinese University of Peking, appeared in his interview with the representative of the journal The Chinese Science Daily, that the challenge facing the Chinese country is now in the next 2 or three years, or that the Chinese country can reduce the number of wheat and wheat that is stored in grain fields.
Now the number of grains each received amounted to 474 kilograms instead of 400 pounds [400 kg] that each person should receive every year.
And now, in China, there are millions of other fields of corn only for the upbringing of the animals.
In other words, those who show concern should calm their minds, bathe themselves in, or make their minds available in their own home.
Individuals may be able to raise themselves and their own foods.
What caused me to glamorize Ganduje in front of the Court - Abba K. Joseph - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The case of the governors of Kano at PDP Abba President Joseph explained the reasons for the decoration of the governors of Kano Data Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and other businesses in front of the Supreme Court.
By means of his lawyer, Abba Gabriel, the Bashir al-Shair al-Shair, who said that he had brought in the harbor, on the basis of the accusations of other government buildings that the nation of Kano had benefited from.
Not to the governor of Kano and the businessman, Abba Hagar Joseph also carried out the services, homes, transportation, vendor, the Kano judicial committee, and the field oversight body.
Joseph Gabriel accused the Kano State of prosecurity and the power of some of the oldest men, Daula, who is now under the supervision of the Wudil University of Science and the field of the Shulammite, claiming that this was inevitable with the provision of such laws.
Only a deserving father, in the carpenter's bathroom in 2023.
This mother and the secretary of Kasa Muhammadu Buhari, Mama Doura, explained that the proclamation style in Nigeria has now become an old native.
Mama Doura says that Nigeria has already had a flax that has now abandoned the reception system to pay attention to the most deserving beverages in 2023.
The BBC Hausa published a conversation with Mammen Doura, as explained.
This paradigm system in Nigeria did not produce an eyewitness child that began in 1999.
Rather, it is recommended that attention be taken to determine who is deserving but not to be followed by such a welcome arrangement.
Only on the basis of those words did the Igbo tribes, Inyamiri, respond.
They claimed that he and his brother - in - law, Buhari, had taken the lead by means of the proclamation, and then he would now come out and give the advice not to be followed in 2023.
The Buchanan himself was not the most prominent Nigerian who had been beaten.
The same was true of the large national security officers who lived on chairs for several years without being removed, as if they were incapable of working.
The wife of Inyamirai.
An invasion of Nigerian political leaders on Laraba’s day, when the Creeds’ Consortium of Igbo Zalla, Ndigbo, devastated Mamman Daura, because of the remarks of the Nigerian leader of the tribe of Inyamurai.
In a coincidence with the Daur, which was a Buhari leader of the Muhammed Leader, a group of judges was to be arranged for the appointment of a global leader in 2023.
In this regard, since they had not finished their civil warship, Ndigbo has hastened to make the announcement to Mamman Daura, calling it a monstrous witchcraft.
In an announcement by Ndigbo on Wednesday, the group of South - South Igbo and the Southeastern Shiyad were to be allowed to produce a minority head in the 2023 ’ s, the Igbo tribe.
Igbo Zalla’s Uncle, Emeka Atmah, said that the words of Mamman Doura, like the coup of the Nigerian leader, were spoken to the Igbo tribe in 2023.
On the contrary, what prevented Mamman Daura from speaking in Arabic since 2019.
They had turned off Jonathan, and now I was able to hand a cocktail to the south of Nigeria, which would take the lead in 2023.
Only after completing what had come from the head of that country’s office now, will he bring us up with a question that we did not know to be accepted in 2023.
It was my desire to have an elder embrace the truth and to keep it in its proper place.
It did not appear in 2023 as a controversy of the State’s leadership, but it was a selfish and selfish act.
The Functional VOA Discussion.
The issue of taking advantage of opportunities for younger women and children by firing them became commonplace in northern Nigeria, where reports were received that showed how children were being reincarned.
On July 23, a group of people from several different backgrounds attended the session to discuss how the situation could be worse in the country and how it should be overcome.
Its surrounding times relate to such issues as girls ’ teenage children and other parents ’ responsibilities.
Many of the mothers who attended the Festi'a Shaibu, the oldest president of Philota and Neja in the time of the San Abacha Mother’s reign, described poverty as a major part of the routine of parenting for their children.
Mary's mother, I'm taking the lead in seeing a party fighting this tragedy. She said, “We should first go and feed the parents on the loneliness of letting their children go out, and then a child is going to be taken out until he is injured.”
We will also call for teachers to start preaching with the sound of a voice to parents and brothers with their children on their own.
In turn, the members of the Society representing Maya’s tabernacle, although Besse of the province of Kevable Shehu Mohammad, described the displeasure and support of the case in the presence of a strict law that would punish anyone who was like a criminal who was in the country.
From the fall of the War, David and Nasiru El - Hidia, who had taken the lead during the convention, you appreciated those who had received the meeting in behalf of the VOA authorities who responded to their invitation.
Construction of the Media Writers to the Day of Resurrection.
Modern - day ceremonies such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bahdama, and others, have often been struggling to find out the political objectives, education, and business goals.
Young people in Nigeria have come into this new trade by using kinships, to travel with modern times, to evacuate or to boil their mouth’s blessing on new ways of life.
We might say, then, that these occasions have brought us much progress that young people in the North have enjoyed in business, economic, and local education and politics.
Some have found work to do, or have bailed, in writing, and weekly food.
It is sad to see how some young people were used instead of using this right to eat the erosion that had been achieved, so there were some who were following the finest citizens of the southern part of the world who were superior to the massacre, in the same country, or to write down pornography, and to take advantage of the opportunities of judges and secretaries.
The point of insecurity is that young people of that country are progressing.
The North American Writers in this country are a great deal of kindness, in order to make sure that young people of the North have a beautiful hierarchy and a glimpse of what young people do in Sociial Media, and that they can be written in meaning with the intentions of the North Community.
It was imperative that we give this body a sacrifice on its own, in order to accomplish its good purposes, which would bring not only pride to our northern territory, but also to Nigeria.
I advise our young people, especially those who use kinsfolk to come to sacrifice to prevent North and Easter’s morality, and to make sure that the arrangement will bring relief to everyone.
Just as our North American leaders had the right to have the Sapphira, the First North Priest Sir Ahmadu Bello, and the Neighbourings were eager to reach the northern nation.
It was said that Marigai, the Great War, oppression, and poverty — the Master Amino Kano — claimed that Nigeria was largely insignificant, but everyone knew his father’s house!
Thus, as we call for the sign, the failure, and the efficiency of the government’s movement, we can, in every step, call the north’s bloodguilt, without prejudice to religion or race, to advance the territory.
When we consider how the North is far from the same.
Therefore, we should use God - given discernment to make wise decisions in order to make the North a satisfying way of life and its economics.
Northa should have been able to open the way for her to work on her own skills without waiting for a government to do so.
More than ever, we wanted to grow in the North, so we became more important to knowledge, farming, eyewitnesses, health care, and science.
There are other ways to do so.
How we think that the North will fulfill our desire for enemies!
How proud it is for us to be in the near future!

In the talk, the chairman of the North Valley in the corner of the APC Sadiq Umar General said that the Nigerian government should take action to improve the health and health of the country.

How the Akure University of Fascism struggled with the web page of PREMIUM TIMES.
The Akure University of Fascism (FUTA) carries the burden of a large gizo enter-cortse, forcing the page PREMIUM TIMES, "online" in Nigeria.
This huge walls of the cylinders — the Internet — made any tactics on the pages of the people, but they were not successful.
He started trying to enter a trunk, "hacking" since February 28, where he dragged the weaponry for the University's taxation, and took it to his native tongue by using "data" this university.
On the other hand, when he struggles with the PREMIUM TIMES and the computer, he takes another attack on the GSM.
Five days later he was anointed to open the door to the PREMIUM TIMES Main PREMIUM, but he failed, even though he had used a thousand - year - old weaponry.
He did not succeed, for the university did not know that the PREMIUM TIMES magazine had its own specific plans, which built the fortress and the coup click that a member of the class did not have enough to break.
Then PREMIUM also had the prestigious superintendents of the modern - day Great internet Web site, which offered the King of PREMIUM TIMES and the Great Designer, the Gulf of the Shield of PREMIUM TIMES.

How the Steward Speaks:
This enthusiast does not know that PREMIUM TIMES has thwarted the health care systems and large cities that enter the garden of modern times and cover the pages of the page or of the cliff.
This lack of knowledge made it possible for all the materials he used to use, more importantly than any other harm or harm to PREMIUM TIMES.
On that day, he suffered from futility because he followed by an attack by DOS in the NTP Ray, which was the oldest way used since Kano’s departure.
It was March 3, but he did not succeed.
This fanatic breaking of the PREMIUM Main Roman TIMES came shortly after PREMIUM TIMES published the story of the culmination between the Council of Leader Muhammadu Buhari in Fannium of The Watch Tower, Father Monguno and the old Prime Minister of Kazakhs, Marigai Abba Kyari.
Some of the Akure University of Fascism have inflicted on PREMIUM TIMES that the university has taken up a military convoy of other large beaches on Internet access-intruders, in order to disguise or repulse the major PREMIUM TIMES.

For example, it would take 15 minutes to combine one major nerve, but now, at this time, it would combine up to 5.
Not surprisingly, she found some more colorful figs that were polluting the weeds that were polluted.
Then there was an additional index that had polluted her animal food, and now the sale of these inscriptions was still available to the seekers.
Seeing the challenges that the teacher of Syria faced, and the efforts she has made to improve her life and career, it will be understood that I am indeed looking for it.
Warfare, poverty, and the improvement of life are not an act that influences governments.
If the government is going to make a claim, but people do not have a crippling or a desire to improve their lives by seeking their own actions based on their own attitude, it will continue to be done only at least four weeks without accomplishing any purpose.
Her story shows that the administration of a business or income - making work does not require some funds or travel to other cities or foreign lands.
Because she considered her situation, she used the blessings in her environment to improve her life.
Moreover, the teacher of Syria carried out these tasks on a stand without her husband’s stubbornness, running away from her.
In other words, the struggle, rejection, and selfish pursuits are hard - to - hearted.
He then showed the courage of a woman to change her life and to stand up for her feet without seeking the help of someone else.
This is also a lesson that shows that whatever a person does, he should stand on his foot, for he or she has no basis.
Indeed, the Syrian Teacher was a corrupt, clever, shrewd manipulative, and exemplary for the rest of the people.
To this day, until the fall of March, the teacher of Syria had finished paying for all the debts that were constructed, and then stopped the government’s taxation on its own.

There is a hope for the U.S. Siasar to be held in the Castle of Dakile COPID-19 — Leadership of Hausa Newspapers.
In recent times, the WHO High Commissioner for Global Health (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has shown concern for the actions that some landscape have taken place, and has preserved the CEVID-19 precursor, which is hoped to be found, where it explains that there must be a way of avoiding the superiority of other nations, while then the predecessor of the announcing.
And it should be divided in the right way to produce the earth, so it would be appropriate for a large percentage of the different landscape.
Indeed, some U.S. political leaders have carried out the goal of displaying the superiority of their own memory, dividing the predicament of the disease, and thus hampering the unity between the land and the country in the fields of the field and the plague.
In today’s state of mind, the number of people confirmed for COVID-19 in the vicinity of the world has already risen to 23 million.
In the same number, there are people who have died of more than 800 thousand infections.

But the sad reality is that some U.S. politicians have demonstrated the goal of embryos.
The magazine “Science” even argues that the U.S. government has embarked on the contracts of the COVID-19 precincts with the value of more than 6 billion dollars from a number of donations.
Although the U.S. government’s objective was understood, the U.S. presence was a major part of the epidemic, but the rest of the embarkers also needed a rigid control, as it were, to see that they were more likely to struggle with the blessing of health care.
The “Ecology” also refers to the fact that if the United States reaches its goal to capture the helmet, the number of oils that will be built will be reduced.
He also showed concern for this matter.
Just as some regulators on everyday affairs reveal, even though the rays have been made successful, it is impossible to reach the goal of seeing after the disease, so it is scheduled to divide the sensor, which is an important issue for failure and failure.
And it is appropriate for the commercial world to strengthen their roots.
The WHO’s leading board, Tedros, also suggests that, if it is to be seen after the disease, it must be stored from all aspects of the earth, you may not be able to accomplish some parts of the world, or a few failings to reach the goal of getting away from the source of the plague.
