● Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “independence” around sex.
Tom Daley, the Olympic attorney of Olympics, said that he was growing up because of his sexuality, and he encouraged him to succeed.
He said that he did not know until he went to high school until he was in high school, he said he was not until the 24-24-year--year school, "They are all like him all" until he went to high school.
First 4 Desert Island Discs on Radiopol homosexual rights, he says that speaking of the rights of homosexuals gives to others a "s hope"
He also said that he was also a parent, and he said that his being a parent also said that he was not too much to worry about winning the Olytopipipipipic over over the Olyp.
The long run approach, Kirsty Young, has always been granted permission for months due to sickness.
He said that the expulsion of the first Laverne program, said Daley, felt that he felt “slowly” because he was not jealous of the community because he was “loving men and women. ”
He says: “There were real things that gave me today, such feelings of lowliness, and feelings of differentness, the power and strength to prevail. ”
He wants to make sure that it was "something", so when they gradually learned about sexuality, he said, "I am not upset."
LGBT, the two-time Olympic Medicist of the Olympic Washing Media, has become the top of the LGBT, and uses the page to use it in Australia’s Commonwealth Games to prevent more countries from viewing homosexuality as a crime.
He spoke publicly because he said that he wanted to see that he felt a sense of humor and that he wanted to give others a "hope" because he could not be clearly--- he could live-- because he felt a sense of humor and that he wanted to give others a "hope".
U.S. film Seri-Dustin Lance Black, which the world champion of the Sost time found with a man in 2013, said, "I am surprised by the fall in love. "
Last year, Daley married Oscar, the greatest victor of his 20 years, but he does not know that the difference of old age is a controversy.
Joe says that it was difficult to find the same person who went to the first Olympic in this young age -- at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer in the body of 60 years -- who had spent the same conquests.
* In May, the teenage boys became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black - Daley, and Daley said that “the overall picture” was changed.
He says, "If you had asked me last year, I would only have wanted to be a gold medal,"
"You know, there are bigger things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Media Robbie is the gold of Olympics."
Robert, his father, had a similar name, just as his son, Robert, died of brain cancer in 2011 at 40 years of age.
He refused to accept his father’s death and said that one of the things he asked was that he took their tickets for London 2012, since he wanted to be a front guard.
He said, "I couldn't tell my father that I would never have brought us back to the front."
He said, "When the breath was cut off, he held his hand, and I was convinced that there was no rumour until the breath stood and died."
By the following evening, Daley overcame the Olympics in 2010 and overcame the gas.
"But if this old age had been sent to you, I knew -- I knew -- that in front of the supportive people, there is no sense of olympic games, no delicious emotion."
His first choice of music, and his choice of music, and his thrilling - boud - pud, in the Heeather Small-Lotopic Arrangement, had been joined by him, and he still creates straw.

The Mickelson, which came down, changed on Saturday to the Ryder Treasury Games.
The American American Phil Mickelson in Ryder's 47th Sunday's Ryder's Ryder's Treill's game, has to change his position to keep unhaunted things.
Mickelson, who is playing for the first 12 years in the two-year bishops to honor us, was replaced by Jim Furyk, who was playing the game for honoring us every two years.
Rather than being a paradigm for the United States, He paid the five-hour victor his time with support and with the preparation of his own game, in order to relieve the five-hour victor from his anxiety.
Even those who travel not to overcome, not from the day he was in his player’s time, and the 48-year-old players are not fitted with the bulk of Le Golf Golf’s national field, which is difficult to repair.
If the field and the toy are not enough to discourage itself, Mickelson will meet the Sunday's ninth game with Rookie Tommy Fleetwood this week, along with Rookie Fleetwood, and four of the four games, with the strongest British winner, Frenchsco Molinari.
The Americans who started 12 games with 4 points lowered, if they did not start with a sharp attack, could testify to the importance of Mickleson’s girdle.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his own person, and did not say much more.
"He realized his full role now, and if he put his hand on me with his back kicking, he will be ready for tomorrow," Al Furyk.
"Faith on his own will be the deepest of faith?"
He is wonderful, and he has added much to the group, and this week he has passed.
I didn't think it would include two games, as an opportunity.
I thought so much, but we thought that we should go along and so much.
He wants to be like everyone else."
On many of the Ryder games, Nick Faldo has left Mickelson’s respectful Mickelson game.
Since the world never likes the glory of its body, it can show the end of the time the player's game.
* Mickelson overcame 18 times when he overcame 20 times, but at least 7 times, he brought things that could not be seen to the group, says Furyk.
He said, "It's a horrible, odd, joke, jokes, jokes people, and it's great to have him in the group."
"The young players have enjoyed playing with him emotionally this week, and it saddens us to see him.
"He gives much more than a game."
* The European Amber Thomas Bjor knows that a wide range of differences will soon be destroyed.
* The European Ambule Thomas Bjord can change the way it is not easy to make easy a journey when it reaches the last day of the Ryder game alone, just as he understood from his own experience.
His first Danean game for Valderrama in 1997, while at the time Seve Ballesteros had five-principal advantages over the Americans, he overcame the game with a smaller effect, a few, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
Remember yourself, “We were leading yourself to Valderrama, and if we failed, we would have prevailed on Brookline, and we overcame the small Valderrama, ” said Bjorn, and he overcame the 2018 graduates 5-3 Wednesday and Tuesday, and saw the national Le Golf in his imagination.
So the history shows that this has not been done for me and for all the members of the group.
And thou shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal thou shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal shal it to morning morning to morning morning morning morning morning
Go to this place, and do all the right things.
The matter is not until you find our numbers on the table.
We have the alma, that's to try to beat the beverages, and that's with the focus.
I spoke to all together. On our side, I focus on our 12 players, but we well know that there are, on the other hand, great players of the world. "
He was delighted with the enthusiasm of the Great World War I, and he added: “I never benefited myself in this regard.
Another Imrey of the next day.
To tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow's tomorrow tomorrow's a person's qualification is a person's qualification the person's in the day tomorrow's tomorrow tomorrow's, and that's a very different thing to work to work.
When things go well, they are bigger to be with Hagar, but while you are alone, they are more likely to be released like galf players.
This is the message you need to take to all players. Tomorrow you hold your best skills.
Now, you leave your partner behind, go, show your best skills."
In addition to Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, at the same time as Jim Furyk’s partner, he expects that the players will show him individually more decorated qualifications than they do in common.
Furyk himself was on both sides of the big changes. Finally, when Europe exalted the “miracle in Medinah ” before he conquered, he was a member of the Rookline victor group.
“ I remember every word, ” says Ben Crenshaw, in 1999, when he responded to the question asked, “Gather together the players to the last day. ”
"Tomorrow we have 12 critical poems, but as you have seen in Brookline, it would be better if you took off that quick arrow, as you saw Medinah.
When he walks in one way to understand it, he is toughened only on a pivotal poem.
We have organized our roads in such a way, and we have put them in the form we feel, you know, and tomorrow we are trying to establish magic."
Thomas was given to try to lead the poem back and Rory McIlroy in a big poem, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter followed in order of half the above Europeans.
He says: “I went with this group of men, and I went in this order, because I thought it would cover up to the inside, so he said, "Burn's single choice.
Ultimately, the German ship of the new warship was retarded.
The German Navy Force had to be applied in 2014 to replace the old war of the cold-war of the Arms of the German Sea, but the increasing cost of corrupting regulations and increasing costs would not last until at least the following year, according to the country’s Media.
The new "Rheinland-Pfalz" of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-cliff, a new pilot of the military ship, entered into force by the Shipyard of the Shipyard of Baden-Wuerttemberg, until half of 2019, was renowned, such as Die Zeit, a military termist.
The ship had to ignite its marine power in 2004, but the difficult issue of the problem of poverty has created a problem in completing the cargo project.
The four Baden-Wuerttttemberg-schf, the Baden-Wuertttemberg-schf, the four ships of Baden-Wuertttemberg, which the sea forces had ordered last 2007 last 2007, will come to the ship of Baden-Wuerttttemberg-schf, and the four ships of the Baden-Wuertttemberg-schf, which were the ships of the Bremen-Bremen-schf, which were the ships of the Baden-Wuerttttemberg, which were in the vans, and the Shi Hui-ai, and the Ari, and the Shii, and the et, and the
He is known as a heifer, an anti-airplane and anti-shipment rifle, as well as a certain stealth technology, such as a small radar, amopolis, and audio films.
Other important features of other important areas will include long-term long-term care--- the new rapid-war-war-war-a-a-fly-fly-fly-fly-fly-fly-fly-t two-year long-for-t two-year long-forwards.
However, while they start the ministry, Die Zeit recalls that when they start the ministry, they would have gone over, he said that a follow-up will allow them to evolve from a safe ship of war - Germany - to embark on overseas overseas.
He was a newsman of the past year of the F125, a vicious ship of war, when German marine power authorities returned to the Blahham & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg, if they were not able to use the ship.
It was the first time when the ship of the sea of the sea of the power of the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the ark of the sea, they returned to the building of the ark of the ark of the ark, when they returned to the ark of the ark.
The reason for the return of the back is very little known. If the warship of the German Medians was on the threshold of the German Mediacs, they mentioned the crucial “software and Herdwer” corruption.
In contrast with the software shortage, it was necessary to establish the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship by 120 sailors, half of the old Bremen part of the human power needed to speed up the warship.
It has been hard in the edch learner, the ship in the ship has been in a dramatic asto wonder, and this has also reduced its qualification and reduced its capacity to reduce it and to limit it to increase its capacity to raise further further the power of the seas.
It is believed that 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Palz" are twice the weight of a ship similar to it that has been used in the Germans during World War II.
It is becoming a matter of concern, including the value of the ship’s training.
It has been reported that from the lowest of €2.2 billion, €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) has arrived in shock.
● The problems surrounding the new rapid ship of war, especially the recent German marine power, were necessary with the warning of a reduction in the power of the German navy.
In the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Parliament’s Committee for Protection of the German Parliament, announced that the power of the sea is indeed “enlarged by ships that are sufficient for the Shipyards”.
The authorities have said that the case has increased on a time-a-flow, because the old-age ships have ceased to work, but the ships have not been brought in.
He sadly said that no Baden-WWWWWWWWertttttemberg's Baden-Wuerttttemberg's Baden-Wuerttttemberg's swift ships of Baden-Wuerttttemberg-Bard-Wuerttttemberg-Berttttemberg's ships of Baden-Wuerttttemberg's swift ships of Baden-Wuertttttembergberg's ships were able able to
The secret life of a single bird is the secret of a national secret listener.
A new study is on the Scottish earth’s repetition to show how the feathers of the birds use the earth for their food hunting.

It is hoped that he will show the importance of any smaller birds in the middle of life and the use of some species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the best protection of forests.
Over the past few years, the number of small birds in Scotland and U.K. has decreased dramatically.
They are in danger of the destruction of the natives and the destruction of life because of building and tranquillity.
They can pose a threat to wind resilience and lightning, such as fly papers and certain building materials, as well as to attacks on radiation.
Indeed, the fowls of the almonds are not blind.

He said, "We have a good place in Threave for a few nights."
We have old buildings, many long enough trees, and all of them good-life.
But there is much that is not known about the fowl birds, so it helps us to understand well what we need to do here and elsewhere. "
The destruction of a parent who unwittingly insists on the need to determine the lack of stereotyped birds before repairing property, can take place up to 400 women and children, perhaps the total population.
It is a crime to kill, attack, disturb them, or destroy their natives.
