..PM of India to attend the temple in a groundbreaking on a site disputed with a controversy.
NEW DELHI (AP) - Il-Prinċep Indjan Minister Narendra Modi se jattendi ċerimonja ta’ groundbreaking for a temple in Hindu on a site disputed in northern India where washing a mosque in the 16th century by hard-liners Hindu in 1992, according to the trust in overseeing the construction of the temple.
Ceremonies are set for Aug. 5, a date that was said to be astrologuous organizers for Hindus, but that also marks a year since Parliament in Indja revoked status semi-autonomous of its only state of Islam-majority, Jammu and Kashmir.
Undoubtedly, it was impossible to miss both the supporters and the opponents of the Hindu Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party of Modi, or BJP, whose manifesto for decades kien jinkludi تعهدi ta’ stripping of the restorative autonomy of Kashmir and building a temple to the God of Hindu Ram, where the Mughal-era once stood, a site in the city of Ayodhija, Uttar Pradesh State, li ddedikaw ruħhom jemmnu li l-post tat-twelid ta’ Ram.
Għaliex il-koronavirus għadu jogħle madwar l-Indja, li rrapporta t-tielet l-ogħla kawżi fid-dinja, se jiġi broadcast iċ-ċelebrazzjoni ħajja fuq televixin statiku u l-għadd ta’ parteċipanti u viżitaturi se jkun limitat, skont Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or the World Hindu Organization, a group of Hindu nationalists allied with the BJP.
Eventwalment, the temple will serve as “ċentru permanenti u immortali of social harmony, unity and integration nazzjonali and awakening of the feeling of Hindutva” or the Hindu way of life, spokesman of the organization, Vinod Bansal, qal in a news release on Saturday.

Iżda serje ta’ miżuri li għaddew dan l-aħħar jew li għadhom ma sarux fil-Parlament of the Commonwealth wasslu għal tħassib dwar l-awtoriċità tagħna, li għandha renowned home.
Included includes a breakdown of the technology for recognition of the face, forced companies of technology to decrypt information held on the computer systems of customers, forced companies of technology to provide access to information based on cloud cloud based on customers of their clients without notifying the owner of the information and extending the ASIO’s mandatory questioning powers.
Dawn il-miżuri jolqtu mistoqsijiet serji dwar il-fruntiera bejn iċ-ċittadini u l-gvern, imma l-ASIO Bill is particularly concerned.
Unlike any of the other five-eyed countries -- the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand -- wara 11 ta’ Settembru, l-ASIO ngħatat il-poter li tissuġġerixxi b’mod obbligatori lill-persuni għal up to seven days fir-rigward ta’ פשעjiet terroristiċi.
Filwaqt li jista’ jkun aċċettat li l-vjolenza estrema assoċjata ma’ جرائم الإرهاب justifies powers straordinarji -- violence estrema at least toffri fruntiera ċara madwar هذه القوى الاستثنائية.
Probabbilment, li ma jistax jingħad dwar id-definizzjonijiet “twavel and vague” użati in this bill biex iqanqal il-poter ta’ suspettar obbligatorju: dealing with information li jippreġudika “relazzjonijiet politiċi, militari jew ekonomiċi ta’ l-Australia ma’ another country”; jew attivitajiet بالتعاون ma’ setgħa barranija li huma kunfidenzjali jew qarrieqi u li huma“ disgusting to the interests of Australia”.
It’s hard to imagine more than this: "Licence of “National Security” Legislation "sweeping and vague."
..ASIO se jitħallew suspettaw bilfors lil xi ħadd dwar dawn l-affarijiet -- mhux biss dawk li huma suspettati mid-delitti.
This includes journalists, business people, university academics and staff, lawyers, citizens, residents and visitors.
Lalle l-ASIO se jkollha biss biex turi l-mistoqsija "japinjament fil-ġbir tal-intelligence" regarding interference الأجنبي, which seems to be the main target of the bill.
Then could a question be asked for up to 40 hours (ma tinkludix breaks).
Jekk dak li jkun refuse to attend, they would be arrested.
* Refusing to answer or to give false or misleading answers would have a sentence maximum of five years.
Ir-regoli li huma fundamentali fis-sistemi legali tagħna -- tabilħaqq protetti mill-kostituzzjoni fl-Istati Uniti -- huma mfixkla b’dan il- bill.
* In-nies – inkluż dawk li diġà qed jiffaċċjaw tariffi – se jkunu obbligati li jipprovdu evidenza li tista’ mbagħad tiġi wżata għall-prosekuzzjoni tagħhom.
Jista’ jkollhom עורך דין preżenti, imma l-avukat ikun limitat biss għal توضيح mistoqsijiet li ma jkunux ċari jew mhux ċari.
The new bill transfers the decision to issue a questionable warrant from a judge to the Attorney-General.
Bħalma semma l-Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, this “is out of the trend for increased requirements for external authorisation in five other jurisdictions of the eye”.
It also violates the principle of separation of powers that the courts examine the actions of the executive government.
The new bill also proposes توسيع نطاق السلطة الاستجوابية għat-tfal li għandhom mill-inqas 14 sena, iżda biss għal dawk involuti jew probabbilment jieħdu sehem f’attivitajiet prejudicial to protect Australia and people from violence politically motivated.
Even if l-aġenziji ta’ l-intelligence tagħna were the best in the world, conferring a power to question anyone b’mod obbligatori about information “prejudicating the economic relations of Australia with another country”, or activities which “deterrent to the interests of Australia” are beyond reason.
We stand alone.

Il-miżura ma tapplikax għal ċittadini Griegi, ċittadini li jgħixu fil-Greċja u passiġġieri għal raġunijiet professjonali sinifikanti.

“ Be wary of gimmies in the garden, which seem to be too good to look.
It may be a shame for scientist plant to admit, but I am a total squirrel for a garden gymick.
I like to think it’s because I am open-handed or maybe just unreasonably optimistic, particularly as many things in the world of the plant are often very counter-intuitive.
But I am not ashamed to say that for dozens of them, I have fallen over lifetime in horticulture.
Filwaqt I strongly believe in the value of trying things for yourself, if you do not fancy learning the hard way, here are some of the most common gimbies in the garden that I came across.

Since both are of the same family and have a broadly similar "plumbing" internally, you can indeed create such a marvels that are surgically strengthened.
Imma hemm il-problema: li wieħed joħloq strutturi ta’ enerġija intensiva, bħall-frott u l-għeruq, jiġbed ħafna enerġija metabolika, u jekk il-pjanti qed jipprovaw jagħmlu kemm l-enerġija limitata tagħhom, żgur li ssir divisive.
Dan ifisser li l-produzzjoni ta’ dawn il-pjanti miksijin hija terribbli, u nothing like what you see in the marketing pictures.
Imbagħad, hemm il-fatt li l-uċuħ tar-raba’ huma mkabbra b’rati differenti, sabiex ikun hemm il-ħsad li għandek bżonn biex tilqaʼ l-pjanti qabel ma t-tadam jinbet.
On the subject of the marketing of pictures, there are also many oddgies dealing here.
Rajt roses Photoshoshopped sky blue and fruit trees with physiologically impossible amount of fruit on the branches of their branches in some catalogs major.
Even in my Instagram account, I've seen ritratti "mgrowed" from the Instagram account and used by netwerks of shopping as stamps of their trial grounds.
Unfortunately, the work of a small minority of cavalier companies means that you have to view stampi ta’ reklamar, b’mod partikolari online, b’għajnejn veloċi ħafna.

Waqt li qed jitkellem dwar dan, il-kulur blu huwa relattivament rari fid-dinja botanika, sabiex jekk tara heater, orchid, or cattus, li qed jiddi f’dell ta’ “disinfecter” blu l-aktar veloċi, surely kważi ġie sprayed jew miksi.
Which would be fine, so long as biyaة make this clear, but rarely do they.
The blue moth orchids will return to their original white, but cacti and heathers sprayed, miksijin b’saff light-pressing of color, unlikely li jibqgħu ħajjin għal a long time.

The editor of China’s Global Times tabloid tabloid puzzled that the US consulate in Chengdu was given 72 hours to close, or until 10 a.m. (0200GMT) Monday, July 27.
China solicited that some staff in the Chengdu consulate were “attivitajiet ta’ kondotta li ma jaqblux ma’ identità tagħhom”.

The HSBC, headed by London, took HSBC bank multinational, to the media soċjali, to say that it was not, as the Chinese media claimed, "proviing evidence" against Huawei, which led to the arrest of the chief financial officer of the company in Canada.

He's "HSBC is not a hostile to Huawei and isn't "frame" Huawei," the bank stated on Saturday, adding that it will never distort facts about clients thereof.
“Responding to requests for information from US DOJ [Dipartiment of Justice] for information, the HSBC Group simply presented il-fatti oġġettivi.

}The company was at the epidemic of a diplomatic scandal for more than a year and a half, since Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou ġie arrestat f’Diċembru 2018 f’Kanada b’mandat mill-Istati Uniti.
● Meng تواجه اتهامات frodiية عن ادعاءها باستخدام شركة قذائف لتنتهك الجزاءات ضد Iran وتكذب على المصارف عن الصلة بين Huawei u l-kumpanija Iranjana Skycom.
Skond l-evidenza ġdida msemmija by the Global Times, HSBC kien konxju tar-relazzjoni tal-kumpanija Ċiniża ma’ Skycom.
It was reported that the bank elect “collude” with the government of the United States to escape from a more severe punishment in 2012, when the bank was to admit violations of money-laundering and sanctions, including restrictions on Iran.
At that time, command was made to pay approximately $1.9 billion in penal terms and to prevent any similar misconduct.
"L-evidenza indikat li HSBC fehmet din ir-relazzjoni, iżda  intentionally باع dokumenti kummerċjali kunfidenzjali tal-klijent tagħha lill-ġenb tal-Istati Uniti sabiex il-gvern tal-Istati Uniti jkun jista’ jinjora l-imġiba ħażina tal-bank Britanniku u not to punish it under the 2012 Prosecution Deferred Agreement", said newspaper in one of its articles on the matter.
Gazzetta kkontrollata minn Beijing żiedet: “If the borrower proves guilty of this “columning”, he might face a “punishment marittimu” fiċ-Ċina, waħda mis-swieq ewlenin ta’ HSBC.
It’s not the first time that the known bank came under fire in recent weeks.
Ix-xahar ta’ qabel, HSBC was numbered for supporting the new national security law for Hong Kong, il-belt fejn bdiet il-kummerċ tagħha u li tammonta għal iktar minn half tal-profitti tagħha.

Home Secretary Prti Patel demands an explanation from Twitter and Instagram on 'abhorrent' Wiley tweets tweets
Priti Patel talbet spjegazzjoni minn Twitter u Instagram over the length of the time it took to remove the “abhorrent” posts of Wiley.
Currently, police are investigating a series of antisemic comments posted on the accounts of the Grime artist’s social media.
Il-Minister of Home Tweeted on Sunday: "Il-postijiet antisemittiċi minn Wiley huma abhorrent."
"M’għandhomx ikunu jistgħu jibqgħu fit-Twitter and Instagram for so long, and I have asked them for spjegazzjoni sħiħa."
"Kumpaniji tal-midja soċjali jridu jaġixxu b’mod aktar mgħaġġel biex jeliminaw il- mibegħda terribbli bħal din mill-pjattaformi tagħhom."
Joe Twitter ġie akkużat li “tinjora antisemitism” peress li tweets of Wiley still appeared 12 hours wara li ġew posted for the first time.
* Minn dak iż-żmien ’ l hawn, ġew eliminati għadd ta’ tweets, and 41-year-old صدرت حظر ta’ sebat ijiem mill-websajt.
* Twitter qal previously that the account of Wiley had been temporarilylocked “because of breaking up our hateful conduct policy”, whereas Facebook said "There is no place for speech hateful speech on Instagram."
The Metropolitan Police said on Saturday: “The Met takes all the reports of antisemitism seriously.
Meanwhile, il-kumpanija ta’ ġestjoni ta’ Wiley, A-List Management, "make all the ties" with the star.
Johannes Woolf, a Jew, kiteb dwar Twitter: "Following the antiseemic tweets of Wiley today we at @A_ListMGMT cut all the ties with him. There is no place in society for antisemitism."
He had said earlier that he did not support or condon what Wiley posted but that he would speak to him privately and "help him to teach him."
However, in a video on Instagram, Wiley seemed to say that it was he who cut off ties with his management.
Other MPs criticized Twitter for allowing the tweets to remain visible.
● Labour MP Jess Phillips said on Saturday:
"I just saw all the Wiley stuff. Why has @Twitter left on earth on such a flagrant antisemitism and hatred? It hits all the dangerous hits, Jews get things that you don't get, they're in control, they think that they're better... This is dangerous stuff.
“Its management seems able to act faster than @Twitter emphasising once again, that legislation (including Online Harms Bill) should ensure that platforms of social media are not used to spread hatred.”
John Mann, the independent advisor on antisemitism independent of the government, said the tweets “was denounced precisely why the law needs to change to keep them accountable.”
Meanwhile, Campaign Against Antisemitism asked the police to investigate the contents of Wiley and called for his social media accounts to be shut down "to prevent further evacuation of anti-Jewish venom."
Wiley, li hu magħruf bħala Godfather of Gremme, whose name is Richard Cowie, irċieva MBE for music services in 2018.

* L-isforzi globali biex jipproduċu mediċini anti-Covid utli qed jiġu mfixkla mill-Istati Uniti, minħabba li riċerkaturi qed jeżaminaw id-drogi “arbitrary, arbitrary, wilful way”, wissa espert li kien qed imexxi l-programm tar-Renju Unit.
The British Trial Recovery Programme, which involva 12,000 pazjent f’diversi 100 hospitals Britanniċi, diġà stabbilixxa mediċina ġdida li tippromwovi l-kura tal-marda, u enfasizzat ukoll żewġ oħrajn -- li qabel kienu thought potential life-revivals -- bħala useless.
Iżda  failure النظام mediku tal-Istati Uniti biex jikkorrispondi ma’ dan il-produzzjoni meant li kura oħra promettenti li setgħet tiġi kklerjata għall-użu mifrux xorta waħda ma kinitx se tiġi valutata.
B’mod partikolari, il-plażma konvalescent (il-plażma tad-demm li tittieħed minn pazjenti Covid-19 li fiha antikorpi li jistgħu jipproteġu others mill-marda) għadha ma ġietx imġarrba kif suppost fuq prova randomised fuq skala kbira.
“Għaxen eluf ta’ nies diġà ngħataw plażma konflixxenti fl-Istati Uniti, iżda dawn il-kurajiet ma kinux randomised, ” qal il-Professur Martin Landray, wieħed mill-fundaturi tal-programm ta’ rkupru.
"They just give individuals convalessive plasma hoped that it will work, an abundance of quantities was given, and yet they have no idea whether it helps, hurts, or has no effect," added Landray, expert in the establishment of large-scale drug trials.
U.S.A. is failing to carry out trials kbar, randomised, u dan ends with providing mediċina ħażina.
Tests on drug-induced drugs are the standard of gold for determining medicines utli.
Huma jneħħu tradizzjonijiet mhux konxji li jistgħu jaqbdu ġudizzji tal-kliniki tal- cloud.

Dawn il-provi rari kienu jeħtieġu għadd kbir ta’ pazjenti, u l-ebda hospital uniku m’għandu biżżejjed ምርምር bħal dan.
Britannja kellha vantaġġ ewlieni wieħed -- Servizz National Health Centralised.
B’kuntrast, is-servizz sanitarju ta’ l-Istati Uniti huwa mqassam, u l-uniku suċċess tiegħu fit-tifsir ta’ trattament possibbli għadu jenfasizza l-benefiċċju ta’ remdesivir, li hu ta’ valur għoli għall-irkupru mgħaġġel ta’ xi pazjenti b’Covid-19.
“There are lots and lots of drug small trials involving a few tens of or a few hundred of patients li qed jaġġustaw l-Istati Uniti iżda xejn ta’ xi sustanza”, وأضافt Landray.
"Huma ma jagħmlux testijiet kbar, randomised, u dan ends with the provision of mediċina ħażina.
Landray qal li dan il-falliment kien partikolarment ta’ frustrazzjoni meta ġie użu ta’ plażma konvalescent, li ħafna اطباء jemmnu li jista’ jkollhom rwol ewlieni biex jieħdu sehem fit-trattament tal-marda serjament ta’ Covid-19.
"If you look at the USA, many of these treatments were used on arbitrary basis, volatilely, and the UK excels beyond measure compared to what's going on there," he added.
Professor Peter Horby, espert dwar il-mard infectious and the other founder of the Recovery programme, qal: “Hemm rapporti ta’ 20,000 pazjent li qed jirċievu plażma konflixxenti f’kohort, imma l-ebda wieħed minn dawn il-pazjenti ma ġie randomized.
Kieku dawn il-pazjenti kienu jinqasmu fi provi randomised, issa kien ikollna tweġiba ċara dwar l-effikaċja tal-plażma konflixxenti."
Herby żied li l-irkupru tar-Renju Unit issa beda prova randomised of convalescence plasma but ma jistennax li r-riżultati jkunu lesti sa tard ta’ din is-sena.

‫The mayor of the City of Kansas welcomes federal assistance in solving murders, but is concerned about the motives of Trump.
● Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas questioned the motives of President Trump on Sunday to send federal agents to the cities of the United States - saying that, whilst he would like to welcome the help in solving a murder murder in Midwestern city, he thinks that move could be more about the chances of re-election of bubalg Trump.
"I was pretty frustrated this week [that] President mentioned protests of George Floyd, mentioned the Black Lives Matter Movement," Lucas, a Democrat, said on "Fox News Sunday" of recent protests against inequality razzjali and brutality of the police.
"That's not the case in Kansas City. kellna żidiet ta' kull sena [but] dak li neħtieġu għall-għajnuna huwa li nneħħu xi wħud mill-רצחjiet mhux solvuti."
.. Lucas żied: "Let's try to have a focal point targeted and targeted on solving murders... I think... I think if you listen to recent statements... we are pleased to work with federal agents in a limited scope."
* Despite his willingness to have agent federali work with local law enforcement, Lucas said that rhetoric of Trump -- speċifikament fid-dawl tal-kunflitti dwar it-tactics employed in Portland, Ore, by the agents federali -- yawned many of his constituents to express concern about the presence of agents on the streets of the city.
"What we don't need is more fuel on the fire from agents federally to make, I think, a political issue exciting," he said.
* Trump nhar الأربعاء ħabbar li kien qed deploy 100 agents federali f’Chicago biex jgħin fil-ġlieda kontra تزايد rati ta’ ċerti الجرائم -- moviment li jimplika espansjoni tal-intervent tal-White House fl-infurzar tal-liġi lokali, hekk kif Trump continues to position himself bħala President tal-"liġi u ordni".

While baikoing federal agents to assist in the enforcement of law locally is not a matter of history -- Attorney-General Bill Barr ħabbar sforz simili f’Diċembru għal sebat cities li kienu raw violence mimxut -- tip ta’ agent federali li was being sent, and some of their tactics, raised tħassib bejn l-istat u l-ministri tal-liġi lokali.

· AP blasts the white House Secretary of the press Kayleigh McEnany for "political" briefings -- but reporters continue to ask questions politically -- RT USA News
The Associated Press accused Kayleigh McEnany of worrying about the media by making her briefs politically rather than informational -- apparently forgetting that journalists choose the questions.
A article on Saturday by the AP, which is the largest news agency in the United States, said that briefings on the press White House may be a "tradition broken down", as McEnany made them "a semplified, full-threatened advertisement for President facing re-election, a venue for attacks on the media and a forum relatively light on information" concerning what the government is doing.
L-aħħar wieħed ta’ dawk l-argumenti huwa inconsistent, ladarba kważi ma jidhrux xi informazzjoni ġdida.
What the AP failed to mention is that hardly any information new is actually sought in the briefings.
Spiss rapporteurs use white House pressers to draw attention to themselves, a form of artisan perfected by the CNN’s Jim Acosta.
* Huma jmorru lil hinn mir-relazzjoni arbitrarja ta’ l-amministrazzjoni tal-midja, billi كرروا lil xulxin biex jistaqsu lill-tacha mistoqsijiet li għandhom l-għan biss li jċaħħdu lill-President Donald Trump.
In some cases, they report for themselves, such as when CBS News Reporter Wejia Jiang responded to a "ask China" repatriated from Trump by making a not so-custodious eavesdic of racism: "Sir, why are you saying that specifically to me?"
* A briefing f’Lulju 6 offriet eżempju ta’ distinzjoni dwar how the briefings ceased to be sors ta’ informazzjoni sinifikanti għall-Amerikani.
That morning, Trump whacked that rated TV NASCAR ta’ NASCAR was hurt by a false allegation of a crime hate against driver Buba Wallace and by its decision to ban the display of flag of the Union in its events.
Definitely, most of the questions were about the tweet as a reporter after rapporteur asked McEnany questions designed to impel her to say that Trump supports the flag of the Federation.
* McEnany did not provide the reporters of the answer that they wanted -- bite sounds that would hurt Trump -- but repeatedly responded billi qalet li l-President ma kienx qed jieħu waqfa fuq l-bandiera tal-Konfederazzjoni u li l-messaġġ tiegħu kien li fans NASCARs were wrongly portrayed as عنصرية.
The AP said that she sounded “displayed” during the briefing.
.. story of the AP echoed a Washington Post op-ed column earlier f’dan ix-xahar by ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl, li huwa wkoll President of the White House Correspondents Association.
Said Karl: “The violation of public trust is a violation of the reality and the use of the White House podium for purely political purposes.”
Yet, the quick and combative style of McEnany made her a hero of some Trump supporters, since she gave her l-ewwel briefing on 1 May after she took the lead as secretary of presses in April.
* Il-pressers kienu maqfulin for more than a year before her appointment.
Like other aspects of political life in Washington, the White House’s press secretary’s relationship with the media has changed dramatically in the era of Trump.
Dak il-bidla ġiet miż-żewġ naħat u waslet McEnany prematurely.
* Din l - ikla taʼ Michelle Wolf, fi April 2018, was so vicious that even MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski called it "deplorable".
AP White House reporter Jill Colvin greeted McEnany in her first briefing by asking, "Ma'll you promise never to lie to us from that podium?"
Joe Fox News Political Analyst Brit Hume, veteran over 50 years of journalism, li kellu a journalist li kien magħruf bħala ABC’s head of White House correspondent 1989-1996, said rapporteurs today display “aggressive behavior” in the briefing room because of their contempt for Trump.
Because of their anti-Trump focus, he said this week on the Tucker Carlson Tonight programme of Fox, journalists are neglecting to collect news policy.
"It's not just a game tocha," said Hume about the intended purpose of the press press.
"It's not just a attempt to embarrass a public official. It's to extract information."

Ħaddiema jibżgħu from the pranksers qed jaqbdu l-primates pesky, li huma magħrufin li jaqtgħu l-idejn ta’ kull min ifakes u jaqtgħu l-windcreen wipers and mirrors.
Ħaddiema issa jibżgħu li huma armati bl-armien killer “for laughing” minn viżitaturi biex isaħħu l-attakki tagħhom u l-pepes, anke madwar bozozijiet tal-għodda themselves.
* Wieħed park worker qal The Sunday Times: “We are not sure whether xi guests who want to see them attack cars, or if they are fishing them out of trucks and trucks of pick-up.”
"Since they literally enter into the toolboxs of the people and carry them around, one of the babies was seen lumping around a chain."
Employee ieħor qal: "Hey the babies were found with knives and screwers, and I wonder if it's a few of the guests who handed them out."
U attakki babies tant huma improbabbli li mekkanics madwar il - grigal taʼ Ingilterra saru jafu sew dwar it.
One mechanic in Sale, Manchester Greater, said that people know what to expect at the park and that he had two clients fallew victim to babies this year.
Huma żiedu li għal minuta, tfal iridu monkeys fuq il-karozzi u l-ieħor ma jkollhomx pjanċa ta’ reġistrazzjoni -- iżda l-kwistjoni tipprovdi "flus tajbin" għall- garage.

‫Codlow says that the next coronavirus stimulus bill will include further checks, extending amoratorium on expulsion
Larry Kudlow, economic adviser White House, promised nhar ta’ Ħadd li l-gvern federali se jestendi l-moratorium dwar evictings u jibgħat round آخر ta’ kontrolli bħala parti mill-pakkett ta’ stimulazzjoni ta’ coronavirus li jmiss.
● Il-kummenti ta’ Kudlow jiġu wara ġimgħa fejn il-Kungress saw a shoot at the White House’s hope for cuts of payroll taxes.
"Here $1,200 check coming, this will be part of the new package. I'd prefer to cut off the payroll tax, top of that check," said Kudlow on the "State of the Union" of the CNN.
"But, whatever it may be, politically, it does not work."
Filwaqt li l-ebda ftehim ma ġie mħabbat b’mod uffiċjali, secret treasure Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows were recently on Capitol Hill to discuss details of a new package of relief with leaders congressional leaders.
Waiting to end the additional $600 in the benefits of unemployment benefit the federal government was providing, Kudlow argued that the extra money was hurting businesses small by employing workers.
He said, "We had a flood of inquiries, telefons, and complaints that stores and businesses, restaurants, ma jistgħux jerġgħu jaqilgħu nies," said.
Probabbilment f’March שעבר, it was necessary for that, but, in fact, there are consequences of people who do not return to work."
formerly in the day of "Fox News Sunday", Monuchin, said, "I think that the workers and the Americans understand the notion that you should not be paid for staying home rather than for work."
● Mnuchin said that the new bill will provide additional benefiċċji unemployment, but لاحظ li it will be less than the payments issued under the CARES Act.
He said that some workers were collecting more than they had earned on the job.
Bħala riżultat, meta negozji kienu qed jerġgħu jiftħu xi impjegati, ma kellhomx inċentiv biex imorru lura għax-xogħol.
* Il-Segretarju qal li l-amministrazzjoni Trump and the Senate Republics are on the same page with a $1 trillion pakkett, but لاحظ li, in order to pass a bill malajr, issues that are more difficult to negotiate with Democrats could be held off for another bill.
..Man Arrested for Allegedly Killing Brother Alcoholic in Greater Noida: Police
A man ta’ 37 sena ġie arrestat Sunday, owing to allegation of killing brother, whose body was found f’żona iżolata ġimgħa ago, in Uttar Pradesh’s Greater Noida, police said.
U.S.P.I.K. wissa lill-pulizija li minħabba l-alcoholicism u l-imġiba ta’ شقيقu, he was abused by alcoholism and misbehavior with women members of their common family, which led him to the crime, according to officials.
Ġurnata ta’ Bhisham Singh, resident in Bisrakh, a village in Greater Noida, nstabet ħdejn l-injam f’żona iżolata madwar ġimgħa ilu.
‫The body bore marks of stabs, and FIR was lodged at the Bisrakh police station and the investigation taken up, said a spokesman of the police.
"In the probation, evidence led the police to the man, who died, his brother Deepak, and was questioned.
The police said that the accused was arrested and lied for murder and other اتهامات related to it.
* Rock from Mars headed home after 600,000 years on earth after 600,000 years.
* Din il-ġimgħa, se jitfgħu biċċa żgħira ta’ rock fil-ispazju fuq waħda mill-aktar vjaġġi stramba bejn il-pjaneta u l-Internet li qatt ipprovaw.
* A small piece of Martian basal size of 10p munita will be launched abbord a robot probe of the United States on Thursday and shipped towards the red planet on a seven-month trip to its home world.
This extraordinary odyssey, the interplanetary equivalent to sending faħam to Newcastle, se jifforma parti importanti mill-esibizzjoni futura ta’ Nasa Mars 2020.
● Industries of space say that the rock -- which was donated by the Museum of Natural History in London -- will be used to calibrate detectors abbord the robot revolver perseverance after landing and starts its search for signs of past life on the planet.
Some of the Martian meteorites li għandna fragileness kbir, but aħna choseנו this one speċifikaly because it's hard as old boots.
"When you turn on the instruments and start to tune them before you use them for research, you kkalibre them on materials li se jkunu like substances unknown to study. So what better for you to study rocks on Mars than a trunk that originated there?" said Professor Caroline Smith, museum Natural History cururator of meteorites.
Ix-xjentisti kienu fiduċjużi li l- rock li kienu qed jirritornaw lejn Mars originated mill-pjaneta, Smith, li wkoll huwa membru tal-grupp xjentifiku Mars 2020.
"Teen bubbles of gas traped inside that meteorite have exactly the same composition as the atmosphere of Mars, so we know that rockna came from there."
Undoubtedly, il-meteorite Martian ġiet maħluqa meta asterojde jew asteride flew fil-pjaneta madwar 600,000 sa 700,000 years ilu, billi spinning debris into space.
Waħda minn dawk il-biċċiet tal-ħasil waqgħet madwar is-sistema solari u fl-aħħar ħarġet lejn l-art.
That meteorite, now known as SAU 008, was discovered f’Oman in 1999, and has been in the care of the Museum of Natural History since then.
Joining among the instruments fitted for the Perseverance rover is a laser tal-precision għoli called Sherloc, which will be used to decipher the chemical composition of rocks and determine whether they may contain organic materials that indicate life once existed -- or still exists -- on Mars.
The inclusion of a piece of SAU 008 is intended to ensure that this is done with the maximum accuracy.
"Smith, piece of rock that we are sending, was specifically chosen because it is the right material in terms of chemicals, but also rock is also very hard", add Smith.
"Some of the Martian meteorites għandna fragileness kbir. This meteorite is hard like boots of old."
Once perseverance chooses the most promising rocks that he can find, he will dump them into caches on the Martian surface.
Then dawn se jiġu ristretti minn militari robots sussegwenti u jinftiehmu fil-ispazju lejn l-art għall-analiżi.

J. UFC fighter Correia gets pummeled after turning back on the thought of the rivals wrongly round was over (VIDEO) - RT Sport News
The Brazilian Bantamweight Bethe Correia is a UFC Veteran but għamlet żball at the end of her beloved by turning her back to the opponent Pannie Kianzad and by thinking wrongly that the round was over in their trunk on the Island of Fighting, and wasted out as a result.
** Waqt li was the end of the first junction of their display on the bottomcard in Abu Dhabi, Correa, a 37-year-old Correa, appeared to be a mistake in the 10-second warning to the actual end of the round, reaching alover before turning her back to Kianzad and turning her way back to corner it.
Il-gwerer Svediż qatel bla heda, u grabbed l-avversarju tagħha bil-lemin qabel ma segwa b’serje ta’ bombi lura Correia kontra l-ekwipaġġ.
* Li jidher b’mod mumentari fil-periklu, wara li l-Brażiliżi reġgħu kisbu l-kontroll biex jaqtgħu t-theddida u lura Kianzad qabel ma ġie msejjaħ it-tmiem reali tal- round.
"What happened there? Oh word of my", was heard as proclamation the ESPN+ commentary team.
It was just part of a night ta’ frustration for the former Bantamweweight challenger title Correia, who was vandalous to a decision unanimous, which was the third loss of her in the past four ottagon exits and left her record as a total at 11-5, with drawwa.
>For the Iranian-born Kianzad, 28, it was a second victor on the spin after its victory over Jessica-Rose Clark at the UFC Fighting Night in Moscow in November.
● Kianzad is now 13-5 in ġenerali and 2-1 in UFC, as the woman, known as 'Banzai', aims at shifting the ranks of 135lb.

Watford reported from Premier League as Aubaméyang fires Arsenal winning
Some of the Watford's players swam to their knees; others made for the tunnel without delay.
* The whistling just blowed on their five years in the Premier League and no one could say that, when the occasion demanded them to throw the kitchen scan in Arsenal, they نزلed without قتال.
This was a performance full of the brazen, urgent, and aggressiveness that marked their best work over the last half-decade, but it came too late, as was the fightback that almost entirely overcame a deficit of three goals in the day.
▸ kieku Emiliano Martínez ma kienx b’mod brilliantly saved backheel of Danny Welbeck from time 16 minuti, shortly wara li sieħbu tal-eks kien wasted in to put Watford within two goals ta’ sigurtà, there was every chance that they could complete a backback for the ages.
Fl-aħħar nett, they felled short and manager of their caretaker, Hayden Mullins, might reflect that he would never have been handed over this most unthankful of tasks had it been for his team to show a similar application in advance.
Matul iż-żmien, they weren’t good enough, but then neither was there any organization that employed them.
Wata campaign fqira may not destroy empire, but neither the foundations put up by the family of Pozzo offer any kind of guarantee they will sail right back from the second step.
It’s hard to escape the sense that the habit of Watford to flip managers has vanished.
* Their future permanenti — perhaps in the most open sense of appointment — will be the 12th in eight years, and there is only much fresh air that a new room can pass through.
* Troy Deeney faces up to the relegation despite getting on the scoresheet in the Emirates.
Censusers will depart, Ismaïla Sarr, who again shows here that it should be inconceivable that he will be playing Championship football in September, and a steady hand should be a priority.
● Ma kien hemm xejn stabbli dwar l-introjtu ta’ boom-or-bust fil-konfront ta’ Mikel Arteta, deskritt bħala “a bit of a basketball game”, għalkemm żgur li for entertainment.
Arteta qalet li wara, il-progress ta’ Watford's forwards kien "tqarraq", għalkemm hu malajr ċċarat li bħala terminu ta’ football for "gambling, staying front".
بالتأكيد kellhom bżonn: kwalunkwe اقتراح dwar punt ta’ konflitti li eventwalment jista’ jkun biżżejjed li jiġi spezzjonat malajr u għandhom mnejn wondered how it would have crossed had it not been obligated to play catch-up.
Minflok, huma aċċettaw sentenza kważi immedjatament.
● Craig Dawson għaqqad mingħajr attenzjoni into Alexandre Lacazitte fi żmien 40 seconds, iżda ħa kważi tliet minuti VAR biex ikun ċert li jagħti l-kick spot, li Pierre-Emerick Aubmeyang bagħat bla fossità.
Watford nġabru biex jistampaw bla heda, b’Saarr f’forma elettrika fuq il - lemin, u resqu lejn Roberto Pereyra u Troy Deeney.
But then Aubmeyang teased Kieran Tierney for a second deflected, and, at the first break of the drinks, the game was shocked so that Arteta was the manager who teared a strip off the players tiegħu despite Arsenal’s advantage.
* Aubmeyang mbagħad kontrolla l-armi twila ta’ Tierney u حوّل ركلة superjuri trampled which left him goal wieħed short of the golden boot, premju li kellu jaqsam ma’ Jamie Vardy hadn’t Ben Foster blocked the last chance near the end.
Watford deher li kien qed jagħmel, iżda huma pperseveraw, u, wara li David Luiz għamel isfida oħra għall-abum f’Welbeck, Dennie raed in his own penalties before breaking.
● Deeney, who walked wounded for most of the season, qabad himself madwar il-function, u kien f’mod ta’ aspirator throughout it.
Probabbilment kien se jaqleb il-possibbiltà li Adam Massan فوّت kmieni fl-ewwel perijodu ta’ wara, u li ma kienx hemm aktar ftuħs.
Happily, Martínez, li Arteta stabbilixxa, wasted for the first time by the excellent Martínez Welbeck, ser jibda t-tazza tal-FA final tas-Sibt, u mbagħad kellha l-Federated Championship of Watford all over their feet upon converting cross fizzanti from Sarr.
Imma l-prospetti ta’ Watford lumbered meta l-isforz li jmiss tiegħu wasted and the soul-searching, from top to bottom, will need to be estensive.

Ultimately, some contracts have clauses that allow them to reduce the minimum guarantee if the amount of people in a area is reduced by a certain percentage, but it is unclear whether this condition is in any of the current contracts between the billboard companies and landowners.
At the same time, il-kumpaniji qed joffru kontijiet kbar lill-proklamaturi biex jimlew slots available on billboards and give them the most valuable money possible.

The Foxes were the second f’Diċembru u third when the football was re-established after thelocking, but ħadu biss 4 points mill-aħħar ħames games tagħhom sa انتهاء fifth at the Premier League.
A winning of the last day over Manchester United would have secured a four-phase, but on the one hand Brendan Rodgers suffered a loss 2-0, which Vardy claims was the most frustrating aspect.
"It was disheartening, the more way we ended up losing the game," he said about Sports Sky full-time.
"Imma we said in the dressing room, we were targeted behind the doors closed to qualify for Europe, and we did so."
"We had the opportunity to qualify for the League of Champions and that was even better, but we'll reflect on it and come back to a stronger year li jmiss."
"It's hard to take it, but الهدف الرئيسي tagħna هو أوروبا, we have managed to do so."
While his team was short, Vardy himself terminated the season bħala l-eqreb fl-età tal-Leave Premier League at 33 years of age, scorning 23 times.
He commended his teammates in receiving the award and said that there are still plenty of miles left in him at the highest level, despite his advanced age.
"I'm glad, it's all about the group. I'm not going to be in the position I was for the goals without them, and I've put a few away."
"I'll have a little rest now and come back to the next season ready to go. Fortunately, I don't feel old age, lumi are still fine and touch wood. I don't pick up much hurts, so it's about keeping up with that and returning to as strong as possible in the following year."

Imma s-segretarju tal- shadow tal-impjieg Nick Thomas-Symonds talab lill-Gvern biex jispjega fid-dettall kif dan se jappoġġa lil dawk affected, u jżid li l-aħbarijiet se jkunu “dwar عميقament dwar familji li jinsabu fl-istokk ta’ Spanja jew li qed jippjanaw li jivvjaġġaw.
● L-Ewwel Ministru Scottish Nicola Sturgeon puzzled that the decision was made wara li eżamina l-aħħar data ta’ qabel is-Sibt.
"This strengthens the point that these matters are subject to change in a short notice, and that is why my advice is to be on guard against travel barranija, which is not essentially necessary," she said.
John Blackmore, from Hampshire, was due to fly to his family in Spain with his wife and two young children.

● Ted Cruz jgħid li l-għanijiet ta’ Pelosi huma “li jkabbru l-flus għall-problema u jwaħħlu l-Amerika”
Washington - Sentur Ted Cruz Repubblikan of Texas akkuża House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats that pushed a coronavirus relief package that focuses on “distribution of cash in the problem and shutting America down” as مفاوضات dwar il-miżura li jmiss continue.
* F’intervista bil-Latvjan “Flee the Nation” Sunday, Cruz qal li l-pajjiż qed iħabbat wiċċu ma’ żewġ kriżijiet fl-istess ħin: pandemic globali li qatel il-ħajja ta’ iktar minn 600,000 ruħ madwar id-dinja u “diżastri ekonomiċi assoluti” fl-Istati Uniti.
But Cruz qal Pelosi, li deher “Abbound of the Nation” ahead of the senator,“ مركَّز على none of those”.
"L-għanijiet tagħhom huma li jkabbru flus għall-problema u jwaħħlu l-Amerika," qal ir-Repubblika Texas.
"And, b'mod partikolari, look at the $3 trillion bill she's trying to push, it's just pushing money to her friends and not actually solving the problem. Goaling to be Americans should want to return to work. They want to be able to provide for their family."
● Senate Repubblikans and White House spentו week שעבר in negotiating the terms of the fourth phase of the coronavirus response, which they expected would cost $1 trillion.
Matul il-ġimgħa, kap tal-persunal tal-White House Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin mar lura to Capitol Hill for more talks with the staff of the Senate, u Mnuchin qal Fox News in a Sunday interview that details are set out to be disclosed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday.
>The most pressing issue for lawmakers -- and a point of controversy between the Repubblikans and the Democrats -- is the ending of enhanced unemployment benefits, which began to leave this weekend.
While Democrats want the “phase 4” coronavirus package to keep the $600 boost for the benefits, the Repubblikans call for it to be repaid and argue that some Americans make more unemployment than they did in wage.
● Cruz qal li iktar minn half من الأمريكيين li jirċievu l-benefiċċji mtejba tal-qgħad qed jiġu mħallsa iktar issa milli meta kienu qed jaħdmu, u lissen lis-sidien żgħar tal-kummerċ f’Texas, who are having difficulty renovating employees.
"Tassew, they won't come back because, in some cases, the Federal Government is paying them twice as much money to stay home," he said.
● Cruz said that the Congress should be focused on passing a bill of recovery, which would make it easier for Americans to return to work by cutting taxes and regulations on small businesses: “بدلا of just knocking trillions out of the door, bill ta’ rkupru would suspend taxxaroll, which would give it a salary increase to everyone in America who is working.
President Trump demanded li l-pakkett ta’ għajnuna li jmiss jinkludi tnaqqis fit-taxxa fuq il-pagi, iżda Mnuchin qal li mhux se jkun parti mill-leġiżlazzjoni, peress li l-proposta ma ġietx aċċettata fost ir-Repubblikani.
‫Sinjura Trump irrikonoxxa li t-tnaqqis tat-taxxa fuq il-ħlasijiet ma jkunx hemm taxxa misjuba fil-kont li jmiss, iżda li jfittex li jaqtaʼ l-mistoqsijiet tad-Demokratiċi.
● Cruz, li l-ġimgħa li għadda oppona l-ispiża tal-pakkett li jmiss, qal li l-Ħadd ma jkunx abbord with the measure from fellow Senate Repubblikan Senate.
Amma hu  criticize wkoll bill $3 trillion passed by the House controlled by Democract in May, u akkuża lill-opposers politiċi tiegħu li deliberately jfasslu miżura li taffettwa lill-President qabel l-elezzjoni ta’ Novembru.
"The only objective for Democracts is to defeat Donald Trump, and they ynically decided aħjar way to defeat Donald Trump is shut down every business in America, shut up every school in America," he said.
"You know, Nancy Pelosi talks about working men and women. What she proposes is to keep men and women working from working."

Happily, she did the same in Maddia Pradesh, said the Congress.

The team Pilot claims li l-appoġġ ta’ 30 MLAs, imma s’issa, il-evidenza tindika li 19 biss.

But Mechichi was not one of the names proposed by the political parties governing President Kais Said.
· In a statement following إعلان السبت, Mechichi said: “Wonder to form a government that meets the expectations of all Tunisians”.

The resignation deepened the political dispute with Ennahda over allegations against Fakhfakh of conflicts of interest.
● Relations between the 47-year-old outgoing leader and Ennahda have been strained since l-elezzjonijiet leġislattivi ta’ Ottubru.
Fakhfakhkh ignited at the same day, the party file a motion against him for lack of confidence.

Joined cars through crowds, protester shot at Colorado.
AURORA, Colo. (AP) - A car was transported through a crowd and a protester was shot at the suburban denver suburban of Aurora’s suburb during demonstrations against racial injustice.
The Aurora Police Department said on Twitter that protesters were walking on Interstate Saturday 225 when a vehicle passed through.
.The police said that protester fired سلاح, killing at least one person who was taken to a hospital f’kundizzjoni stabbli.
The Authorities said that the vehicle was towed and that they were investigating.
The prosecutors also broke windows to the courtyard and fire was started in a office, the police said.
* Ġie ddikjarat assemblea illegali, and the police commanded protesters to leave the area, according to the authorities.
L-istressi żdiedu minħabba protesti reċenti kontra l-inġustizzja razzjali peress li l-uffiċjali federali ntbagħtu biex jegħlbu d-dimostranti f’Portland, Oregon.
Police ddikjarat ritwal at Seattle on Saturday.
Protests li ignited by the death of George Floyd 25 ta’ Mejju, a black man in Minnesota, who died after a white officer grabbed him to the ground, kneeling down to his neck, enfasizzaw ukoll każijiet oħra ta’ vjolenza fatali tal-pulizija.

* Il-Lag Tahoe, b’mod famuż ċar, ġiet pollutata permezz ta’ tibdil fil-klima.
- South Lake Tahoe, California - Minkejja l - epidemic, anke f’ġimgħa, in - nies għadhom crowded Pope Beach at Lake Tahoe.
"I like camping and riding a bike and swiming at the Lake," said a girl named Dakota.
"This is something beautiful everyone wants to visit," said Emerica Benitas.
ولهذا السبب, il - kummerċ dives of Mat Meunier continues to get stronger, even f’ pandemic.
He says that he sees “clarity clear. Lake Tahoe is the purest, the most wonderful, beach, I think, in the country."
Now the bad news: Lake Tahoe isn't clean, as clear, just as it used to be when he moved here over two decades ago.
"The thing that we are noticing is more and more on the rocks," said Meunier.
"You're getting this strange algae on the rocks."
Ix-xjentisti jemmnu li t-tibdil fil-klima effettwa t-temperatura tal-ilma, u b’hekk, it’s clear.
And 15 million people visit the lake annually, along with the garbage they leave.
Said Meunier: “It was a voyages dive to clean up the bottom of the lake that found trash old.
"And when I say the old garbage, I mean '60s, '70s', Meunier said.
"Beer cans, soda cans, key church canns from the days of old."
Ix-xjentisti jimmonitorjaw ċarezza ta’ Lake Tahoe kull sena billi jarmu diska abjad, u mbagħad jikkalkulaw kemm huma jistgħu jarawh.
Professur Geoff Schladow UC Davis said that it's a "indicator of how healthy the lake is".
Meta kejlu fis-sena li għaddiet, iċ-ċarezza tal-baħħara kienet ta’ madwar 80 metru.
This means that you can see that disc is 80 feet down.
But, consider this, some 20 years ago, il-qamar ċar tal-baħħara kien 100 metru.
That's the trend scientists are trying to reverse.
Imma huma qed jiġġieldu kontra l-impatti tat-tibdil fil-klima, ta’ l-iżvilupp madwar il-بحيرة u ta’ xi ħaġa miżjuda mal-baħar fl-1960: Shirimp invasive minority brought to feed fish.
It didn't work.
Schladow qal, "Meta l-shrimp daħal, f'daqqa waħda ma kienx hemm cleaners naturali fil-baħħara."
Dawn il-isfidi simili jiffaċċjaw lags u korpi tal-ilma madwar id-dinja.
"The lesson here is, if you cannot do it at Tahoe, then what hope is there for all the rivers and theaters, rivers and lakes all around the country that will never have the same level of attention, the same level of resources?" Schladow said.
Said Meunier: "Here's hope" because "if there's a silver peninsula of pandemics, I think it showed that nature will come back and heal itself if we just relieve that pressure, that pressure humani, from it, and allow it to happen. There are facts now."
Joe MACED Couple at the California dog park for not wearing masks face while having lunch (VIDEO) - RT News of the United States of America
There's a mask-shaking and then there's an attack full.
* A couple with a California who have lunch with their pupil in a dog park experienced the second, when a woman Irate-pipper-sprayed them for refusing to mask... while eating.
● Ash O'Brien and husband Jarett Kelly say that they were taking a pie to eat at Dusty Rodes dog park in San Diego on Thursday, with their three-month-old pug in tow.
L-irġiel kellhom il-masks tagħhom off to eat, when a “marya old ” approached, calling them“ idiots ” because they weren’t tossing, even though “You’re not able to wear mask and eat at the same time”.
Helen O'Brien told the woman that she should leave the park and stop harassing her.
* The video footage caught by a pastor starts with Kelly fighting the spray can from the woman, and gets a dosage of thorns into the face for his problems.
Happily, O'Brien can be heard crying backwards as the attacker walks away with kliebha.
Even O'Brien shared the video on Facebook and told ABC 10 that she wanted to see the woman "go to prison."
Il-makkinarju tal-wiċċ huwa obbligatorju madwar l-istat tal-Kalifornja, anki f’arja عذبa.
Dawn il-mases can only be removed at a few times, including meta you eat or drink.
However, nowhere in the coronavirus guidelines of the State, it does say that bystanders may use weapons non-lealized to enforce this policy.
Even in the present era of "mask-sharing", that is still a crime that still holds a fine ta’ $1,000 jew up to three years in a state prison.

"We were planning a number of celebrations to mark the occasion, but unfortunately, they had to be postponed.
Minkejja dan, "Although, the fact that work is about to start shortly on the renovation £10m is the best birthday present and will ensure that generations to come will be able to enjoy the Bridge in all its splendidness."
Ice Scotland director Hannah Smith iddeskriva l-bridge bħala parti mill-wirt ta’ l-inġinerija ta’ Scotland.
قالت: "We know that the world is well known throughout the world and that work will soon begin upon renovation."

"You can imagine that the enemy was swept up in the mountains, whilst forces were fighting them from below, but the morality and truth of our forces overcame the mountains," he added.

“The Persians” Review: Aeschylus’s Ancient Portrait of Defeat’s Portrait of Aeschylus
There is no great deal of action, even a plan, in "The Persians".
الناس يطمحون حول, يتحدثون (verily pjuttost enthusiastically) about events (such as the kind of tragedy) li seħħew far away.
Yet this National Theater of Greece produces fires sound and fury for the gale-force.
At its peak, the show hits like a blow to the sun’s pulses, taking your breath away -- l-impatt huwa kemxejn tackled biss by watching online.
Formerly produced in 472 B.C., Aeschylus’s "The Persians" is considered the oldest play Grieg li survived.
● Din l-istadju ta’ Dimitris Lignadis ġie broadcast ħajjiet nhar is-Sibt mill-amphitheater tal-Epiduurus tal-qadim; fl-ispirtu tal-attributur, m’hemm l-ebda recording online.
>The place was originally conceived as part of the city’s asclepion (ċentru ta’ kura) because the Greeks considered il-bilanċ bejn il-ġisem u l- soul essenzjali għas-saħħa tajba.
Let's all reflect on that philosophie carefully.
The show dealt with the aftermath of Salamis, a battle navali, where il - Griegi inexpensively ignited the mighty army Persjan 2,500 years ago.
F’ħin meta l-orizzontijiet tagħna jkunu qed jassumu, it’s a downright vertigo that virtually joins a live audience in watching (subtitled) actors ħajjin throughout the way in Greece as they play a thousand years old.
Aeschylus himself kien qed jiġġieled at Salamis, but play tiegħu has a distortion: this veteran of the winning side set his story among the defeated, glancing his eye empatheticly fairly on the distress of his recent enemies.
A chorus of the Persians, dressed long, of colored skirts and white shirts down-button, opens the proceedings.
They are in their capital city, waiting eagerly for news of their king, Xerxes, who is off to dispossess it with Athens.
Enter the widowed mother of Xerxes, Queen Atosa (Lydia Coniordou), into a black gown pjuttost kbir li يبدو li jilbsuha, rather than reverse; she is a human in an exoskeleton of fabric, kemm vulnerable kif ukoll impaired.
Coniordou, who is among the largest attributors of Greece, knows the role inside her out -- she directed and stared at a previous National Theater of Greece production of the "The Persians" that played the Center of New York City in 2006 -- and she carries the proceedings without seemingly doing much at all.
רובا, hi tinsab f’nofs l-istadju ċirkuliku, filwaqt li mingħajr sforz tippjana frustrazzjoni ta’ rabja u ta’ qsim il-qalb hekk kif jiġi muri l-ambitu tad-diżastri li jġarrbu l-forzi tad-dar.
A messenger (Argyris Pandazaras) who returns from front is confirmed by the apprehending of everyone was, in deliberating details, by a messenger (Argiris Pandazaras).
* F’xi ċirku taʼ l - għaġeb, huwa jgħodd il - battalja, billi jaqlebha franzy as the chorus members dance around it, and the Georgos Poulios score like the drone pullios swells to what must have been a level of deafness.
Later, they were joined by the dead husband of Atosa (Nikos Karathanos), who was called from the bottom of the world, and Xerxes (Argyris Xafis), who somehow escaped alive mill-waste.

Sunday with Oliver Spencer: "Mayni ma nattendix, Sundays are for loungewear"
How does Sunday begin?
♪ With me to stumble the stairs and fall down onto the dog along my way to make my wife a cup of tea.
Jekk lucky me, we would have escaped London to our coastal house on Isle of Wight.
The two of us will sit together and look around the water in silence.
sounds like Serene...
Dan hu, until 8am, when two or three من wliedنا ركبوا على door, demanding breakfast.
It's bacon and eggs for them, spinach and mushrooms for us; then if it's good for the weather, we'll get the boys out.
We'll swim, paddleboard, jew take a walk around Quarr Abbey, beautiful Quarr Abbey, which looks like something straight out of the Games of the Thrones.
And during the time of thelock?

{\pos(192,210)}Shoulders online jw.e.b., jw.org. Scheme of loans SME may miss the mark.
The small business sector, which is often subserved by banks, has turned increasingly into borrowers online to meet its funding needs.
Madankollu, Mr. Callaghan, قال li l-investituri onlajn were disadvantaged meta mqabbel mal-banek il-kbar minħabba li ma kellhomx aċċess għall-istess التمويل li hu bi prezzijiet baxxi u wissa نتيجة لذلك, l-iskema ta’ garanzija SME was not gaining traction.
"I think it may have missed the mark where all the people who call us, call in the expectation they can get a very cheap funding rather than government supporting 50% of the loan," he said.
"So they call and they are disappointed because the expectation was placed there that there was a skonting أسعار and we look at the cost of our funding, which has not changed at all."
وأضاف Mr. Callaghan jekk Fintechs were able to access funding cheaper and pass it on to businesses smaller, that the scheme would be "no brainer".
"It was a bit of a Catch 22 the major banks got access to the lowest amount of cost funding, but they're more at risk abominable so that they're not actually going to borrow the same way, they're not able to get access to the data and they're not able to get comfortable unless you have property," he said. "Sakemm we can get that cheaper funding I think there's a fiction out of the market on how popular the scheme will be."
● Moula based on Melbourne is also participating in the scheme, and Chief Executive Aris Allegos said that the benefit of the 50 per cent guarantee, implicitly in the government scheme, should be handed over to small businesses but various borrowers handled it b’diversi modi.
He said, "I can understand that there may be others who do not pass through that cost structure," he said.
"It may be a function of how their funding is structured and it may also be a function of which categories they are lending to and how they assess the risk within those categories."
woe Mr Allegos ma kienx se jipprovdi تفاصيل عن عدد القروض التي صادرتها Moula under the scheme, but qal li l-iskema revamped was “acknowledge core of what was needed to change” to offer more flexibility to the borrowers and the borrowers.
However, he said that his main concern was the “ekonomy of two speeds” that was operating and the impact this would have on small businesses.
"L-akbar issue Moula must face and borrowers in relation to small businesses is that cliff proverbial and how to manage into that cliff," he said.
"Saying generally as regards demand, ma reġgħux lura għall-livelli ta’ qabel COVID minkejja li l-aptit qed jikber."
< ASX-listed online by a loaner Prospa would also not detail how much of the loans she gave under the scheme, given that she said that the information was commercially sensitive, but chief executive Greg Moshal said that the Goverment’s extension of the scheme was welcome.
"We support any improvements to the scheme, which will enable businesses smaller ones to access a wide range of funding products that meet their requirements, including fragile cash flow products on shorter terms," said.

Hell said that the situation was then assessed yesterday afternoon, "And we took the decision as soon as possible."
"Absolutely, we cannot make apology for doing so," he added.
We must be able to take swift, decisive action, b’mod partikolari fir-rigward tal-localised, or internationally, in relation to Spain or a certain country, where we see that we must take action.
"On the other hand, we risk the re-infection into UK, probabbilment wave oħra hawnhekk u mbagħad locked another."

Jonathan Ashworth, Secretary of Health of Shadow, ikkundanna lill-Gvern għall-immaniġġar tal-“francial shambolic” tal-miżura.
He said that the decision of Downing Street, f'daqqa waħda, left the holiday-makers “necessary and distressed”.
> The Labour MP told Sophie Ridge: “I understand why they made the decision, but, of course, the way this decision was made in the last 24 hours, it was frankly shambolic.
"There are holidaymakers in Spain in the moment when they are confused and troubled, there are people about to go holidays to Spain and islands such as Tenerife who are confused, and they don’t know whether employers will allow them to take quarantine ta’ ġimagħtejn.
"The Government is just saying, "we hope that employers will cooperate."
"The way this decision was made in the last 24 hours is frankly shambolic."
What does Spain’s being on a list of quarantine mean for holidaymakers?
He urged ministers to offer “klass” dwar jekk dawk li jintalbu biex isservi ta’ kwarantina humiex se jirċievu appoġġ finanzjarju jekk min iħaddimhom ma jħallshomx matul il-perjodu ta’ kwarantina.
He added that there was also a need for clear information: "For those who celebrate holidays currently in Spain, who have saved correctly all year for family holidays that are confusing and distressed."
"The way this decision was communicated clearly causes anxiety," he stressed.
Mr. Raab said li l-ebda ħadd ħadd ma ħadem تبعا للتوجيه الجديد m’għandux ikun mhedded minn employers, inkluż by putting him on a sick pay.
Hu said: "We're changing the rules -- law's change in relation to holidaymakers and travellers -- and, of course, we expect employers to show lill-impjegati li se jkollhom il-quatering due to the law the flexibility they need."
"If anyone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-separation as they ought to, it is impossible for him to have penalties against them."
