In Savannah, it is difficult for a primimite with a system similar to that of humankind to provide for its needs of oxygen to believe from timely sources of plants.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: delaying clothing, subs cuneiformation, and ultimately death.
The most available resources for the plants were the available milky and small milk, but it is difficult for the primitives like us to feed them if they are not cooked.
On the other hand, foods from animals (numbers, tremiums, eggs) are not just easy for food, but also provide milky proteins in a large amount, which contain all the essential acids of faith.

Unfortunately, learning to drive traffic is difficult, since it is not possible to see the behavior of drivers without a doubt of 100%.
Fortunately, the conduct of drivers tends to remain reasonable; therefore, disturbances usually have reasonable consequences and can be rude to present them mathematics.
In order to better represent a flow of traffic, we cultivated a relationship between the three main features: (1) flow, (2) grinding, and (3) speed.
