● Welsh AMs worried about 'seeing like muppets'
● Hemm konservazzjoni fost xi AMs bi proposta li titolu tagħhom għandu jinbidel għal MWPs (Membru of the Welsh Parliament).
Dan نشأ minħabba pjanijiet biex il-Bulgarija ta’ Welsh tinbidel l-isem tal-Assemblea.
Joined by the political spectrum, the AMs throughout the political spectrum are concerned that it may invite ridicule.
Wani AM Labourer qal li l-grupp tiegħu kien imħasseb: "It's a rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means daft and pwp means poo.
● A Plaid AM said that the group as a whole was "no happy" and suggested alternatives.
> A Welsh Conservative said that his group was “opened ” about the change in the name, but noted that it was a short verbal hop from MWP to Muppet.
F’dan il-kuntest The Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the New Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Committee of the Assembly, who is currently صياغة تشريعات لإدخال تغييرات في الاسم, said: “The final decision on any descriptor of what Members of the Assembly are called Members, naturally, will be a matter for the members themselves.”
> The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
F’Ġunju, il-Kummissjoni ppubblikat ir-riżultati ta’ konsultazzjoni pubblika dwar il-proposti li rċiviet appoġġ wiesa’ għall-istqarrija tal-Assemblea Parliament Welsh.
On the matter of the title of the AMS, the Commission favoured Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but option MWP received l-aktar appoġġ f’konsultazzjoni pubblika.
Apparently, AMs suggest خيارات بديلة, but ġlieda biex jintlaħaq توافق الآراء tista’ tkun ta’ uġigħ ta’ ras għall-uffiċjal الرئاسة, Elin Jones, li huwa mistenni li jippreżenta l-abbozz ta’ leġiżlazzjoni dwar il-bidliet fi żmien ġimgħat.
● Il-leġiżlazzjoni dwar ir-riformi se tinkludi tibdiliet oħra fil-mod kif taħdem l-Assemblea, inkluż regoli dwar l-insuffiċjenza tal-AMs u dwar it-tfassil ta’ sistema tal-kumitat.

The Macedonians go to polls in referendum on changing name of the country.
Hawnhekk, il-voti tal-Ħadd se jivvotaw dwar jekk għandhomx ibiddlu isem pajjiżهم għal "Repubblika tal-Maċedonja ta' Fuq".
The popular vote was set up in a bid to resolve tilwima għal għaxriet ta’ snin mal-Greċja ġirien, li għandha l-provinċja tagħha, li hija msejħa Macedonia.
Ateni ilha żmien twil tenfasizza li l-isem tal-ġirier tagħha tat-Tramuntana jirrappreżenta talba fit-territorju tagħha u li ብተደጋጋሚ opponat lill-membri tagħha bids għall-UE u NATO.
President Macedonian Gjorge Ivanov, opposing the plebishite on the name change, qal li se jinjora l-vot.
Madankollu, dawk li jappoġġaw ir-referendum, inkluż il-Prim Ministru Zoran Zaev, jargumentaw li bidla fl-isem hija sempliċement l-ispiża li għandha titħallas biex tingħaqad mal-UE u mal-NATO.
The Bells of the Fall of St. Martin as Churches in Harlem Struggle
"Historically, the old people I spoke to say that there was a bar and church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Tomorrow, neither is there."
He just said that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“People socialize b’mod differenti” qal issa.
"Bars are no longer rooms living in a neighborhood where people go on a regular basis."
As regards churches, he is concerned about the fact that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders expect it, "and sooner or later, they will be right back where they started."
He added that churchgoers could be replaced by buildings of apartments with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help residual temples of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and, therefore, will hurry to the day when these churches are all around, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condoms will become members of these churches."

Mr. Meriweather said that St. Martin'ss did not replace him.
What played at St. Martin’s last few months was a story complicated of architecture and contractors, some of whom were brought up by the church’s top leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The vestry -- the parish’s governing body, composed of leaders -- wrote id-diocese f’Lulju, b’tħassib li d-diocese would “search to pass along the costs” to the festry, even though il-ħwawar ma kienx involut f’impjieg tal-arkitettriċi u l-kuntratturi dioce sent in.

Peter Jones 'frightful' after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a deal of 11 million £.
> Dragons Den star Peter Jones left 'fright' after Holly Willoughby, presenter TV, pulled out of £11 million dealing with his lifetime brand business to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the real sign of their home clothes and accessories.
Included in the business of the couple were compared with the Goop mark of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This 37-year-old presenter of Morning took him to Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
* Holly Willoughby left Dragons” Den star Peter Jones fuming by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle trade marks in the last minute - to focus on its new bamboo contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “abluded” when the girl gold TV admitted during a meeting tense on Tuesday at headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth £1.5 million - meant that she had no more time to devote to their home clothes and accessories truly.
This business was likened to the Goop mark of Gwyneth Paltrow and was tied to the estimated £11 million fortune doubled of Willoughby.
Bħala Willoughby, 37, he took to Instagram to announce that she was actually leaving, Jones flogged out of Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
For example, a source said: "Truly, it was to a large extent the top of Holly’s priorities.
He was going to be her long-term future that would see her through the next couple of decades.
Deciding whether she would be expelled, she left everyone involved متفاجئ.
Ħadd ma setaʼ jemmen dak li kien qed jiġri يوم الثلاثاء, وكان ذلك بالقرب من الإطلاق.
There is a warehouse filled with goods at the Marlow HQ, ready to be sold."
Esperti jemmnu li t-tluq ta’ dan il-preżentazzjoni Morning, li huwa fost l-aktar כוכבi bankarji ta’ Britannja, jista’ jħallas lill-miljuni sħaħ minħabba استثمارi ħorox f’prodotti li jvarjaw minn cusses u candles għal ħwejjeġ u ħwejjeġ, u l-potenzjal għal iktar dewmien sal-bidu.
Dan jistaʼ jfisser end ta’ ħbiberija twila.
Mother of three Willowby and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby set up truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined chairman f’March.
The couples celebrated together, Johns has a 40% stake in the company of the production of TV of Baldwin.
Willoughby is to become ambassador brand for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin bħala host of ITV I'm Celebrity.
Even a source close to Jones said last night, "Ma konniex nikkummentaw dwar kwistjonijiet التجارية tiegħu."
Murmuring hard "and then we fella in love"
He giged about criticism he would get from the news media for commenting that some would consider “presiding” and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his mocking voice "news anchor".
"Ma ויתרתי xejn."
● Hu osserva li Kim hija interessati f’laqgħa שניa wara li l-laqgħa inizjali tagħhom f’Singap in June wasted by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
ولكن مفاوضات dwar id-denuclearization قد انقلبت.
More than three months wara Summit of June in Singapore, top diplomat ta’ North Korea Ri Yong Ho qal lill-mexxejja tad-dinja fis-Sibt tal-Istati Uniti li t-Tramuntana ma ratx "responsabbli" mill-Istati Uniti sal-bidu tal-movimenti bikrin ta’ نزع السلاح tal-Korea ta’ Fuq.
Minflok, hu لاحظ, U.S.A. is continuing جزاءات aimed at maintaining the pressure.
● Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
Hu qal li l-isforzi tiegħu biex jitjiebu r-relazzjonijiet ma’ Kim wasslu għal riżultati pożittivi.
U hu ddefenda l-approċċ mhux tas-soltu tiegħu meta tkellem dwar relazzjonijiet ma’ Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this packed area, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," said Trump, pointing to the crowd directly before him.

The statue of Parliament of Cromwell sar l-aħħar memorandum hit by 'kitba history' row
Its expulsion would be just poetic for the destruction of his Talibanlike destruction of so many of the cultural and religious artifacts of England carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Soċjetà Cromwell iddeskrivat l-offerta ta’ Mr Crick bħala “foolishness” and“attenting to write history”.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the present debate about the removal of statues, it was impossible in the debate that figures of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Probabbilment Cromwell maqsuma kien se jiġi ssagrifikat għall - azzjonijiet taʼ missieru Thomas fil - seklu taʼ qabel.
Sur William Hamo Thorneycroft’s great representation of Cromwell is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe still deserve a celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people, perhaps in late 19th century, view Cromwell as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case, naturally, the kingship.
X’jistgħu jkunu r-rappreżentanza sħiħa eżatta hija s-suġġett ta’ diskussjoni storika kontinwa.
X’inhu ċert li l-kunflitt ta’ nofs is-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell huwa figura individwali li tista’ tiġi rikonoxxuta li jirrappreżenta naħa waħda ta’ dik id-diviżjoni.
Anatomy of the Lord as Protector is also worthwhile celebrating and commemorating."

Bħala توقع, the Rosa Hurricane is dgħajfa hekk kif it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Madankollu, Rosa will bring rainstorming torrents madwar it - tramuntana tal - Messiku u l - punent taʼ l - U.S. matul il - jiem li ġejjin.
Rosa kellha l-irjieħ ta’ 85 mph, Categorija 1 Hurricane, sal-5 a.m., il-ħin tal-Lvant tal-Ħadd, u kienet tinsab 385 mil southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move northwest on Sunday.
Meanwhile, trudge begins to shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward lejn il - Kosta tal - Punent taʼ l - Istati Uniti hekk kif Rosa tersaq lejn peninsula Baja California nhar it - Tnejn bħala storm tropikali, u tibda timbotta ruħha lejn it - tramuntana lejn il - grigal tal - Istati Uniti.
It - Tnejn, it - Tnejn, Rosa, se tivvjaġġa sa 10 pulzieri ta’ rain f’partijiet tal - Messiku.
Imbagħad, meta l-umdità tropikali tkun konnessa mal-ħsara li qed tivvjaġġa, dan se joħloq rainstorms heavy rains in the Southwestern over the coming days.
Locally, 1 sa 4 pulzieri ta’ ilma se jikkawżaw għargħar flash, تدفقات ta’ debris, u possibbiltà ta’ landlids in the desert.

Around 2 to 4 inches (4 to 4 inches) of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
It’s possible to flood flash with conditions li deteriorate rapidly due to the scattered nature of rain tropical.
Zai jkun ta’ سوء parir kbir li wieħed jegħreq lejn id - deżert foot by foot, owing to the threat of rainfall tropikali.
IN MANY rainstorms velocity can cause canyons to become rivers monsters, and tempesti thunderstorms se jġibu riħ velenuż u ħamrija li t blow.

The menga strike gives Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers
Tabilħaqq, Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston was a victory secured.
● Immiratily promoss Livingston Rangers to consign Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
‫The Dallly Menga strike proved to be the difference as Gary Holt's side moved the level with Hibernian in seconds.
Gerrard’s side remains without a winning away in Premiership this season and faces leaders of the heart, who run by eight points, Sunday li jmiss.
Prior to that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna at the League of Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston, widens their unbeatten runs in the division to six games, with the head coach Holt still to taste the victory since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses the chances against visitors bluntly.
Hayden Holt's team should have been forwarded a long time before it was assessed, with their directness causing Rangers all kinds of problems.
● Scott Robinson għadda mill-isforzi tiegħu, iżda gragged madwar il-mira, imbagħad Alan Lithgou setaʼ jmexxi sforzu wiesa’ biss wara li slided in to meet Craig Halket’s head across the goal.
The hosts were content to let Rangers play ahead of them, knowing that they could trouble the visitors with pieces set up.
And that was how the crucial goal was reached.
● Rangers conceded a free-lack and Livingston, Declan Gallagher and Robinson in combination, to set up Menga, who took touch and evacuated from the centre of the box.
Sa dak iż-żmien, Rangers dominated the possession, but sabu li d-defiċit tad-defiċit u liam Kelly, liam Kelly, was not greatly troubled,
That pattern kompla sal-aħħar half, għalkemm Alfredo Morelos ġiegħel lil Kelly to save.
● Scott Pittman ġie miċħud minn saqajn Rangers’ keeper Alan McGregor and Litgou’s goal guard, libbed wiesa’ minn another set of Livingston games.
Crosses dejjem daħlu fil-kaxxa Livingston u ġew kklerjati kontinwament, filwaqt li żewġ talbiet għall-piena -- wara l-isfida ta’ Halket dwar is-sostituzzjoni ta’ Glenn Middleton, u waħda għal כדור arm -- tneħħew.

Waqt li reġgħu lura lejn l-ogħla titjira, il-modalità tagħhom u l-persunal tagħhom ftit wara li nbidlu, iżda l-akbar credit must go to Holt for the way he assimilated the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
‫Kaptan Halket kien enormi, marshalling a دفاع superbly-organized, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrral on their fingers throughout.
However, Rangers were not inspired by God.
Bħalma at times kienu tajbin taħt Gerrard, huma سقطوا ناقصين جدا من تلك المعايير.
Cooper was lacking in their final ball -- only once they cut the side of the house open -- and it's something of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.

He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the show that abrogated for "causes emotional," said صانع العرض.
As well as a glimpse of his current professional name, Westwest has previously said that the word has a religious significance for him.
I believe "I believe" is the most common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "You," qal West earlier this year, discussing his album title with the Big Radio host Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, it's us.
Got from Canye, which means the only one, to you -- just to reflect on our good, bad, confusion, all things.
The album is more reflective of who we are."

● As China becomes more active in intelligence artifiċjali, USS should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says investitur u AI prattikant Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
● Il-kummenti jiġu wara li diversi partijiet tal-gvern tal-Istati Uniti jkunu ħabbru l-AI, ladarba l-Istati Uniti in general ma tantx ikollha strateġija formali tal-AI.
Meanwhile, China introduced l-pjan tagħha fis-sena الماضي: hija maħsuba biex tkun Nru.1 fl-innovazzjoni ta’ l-AI sal-2030.
"Doubts on budget research AI would be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind U.S., and we are looking for the next break in AI," said Lee.
● Borrowing funding can double the chances that AI’s big next achievement will be done in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, li l-ktieb tagħha "AI Superpowers: China, Valley of Silicon and the New World Order" ppubblikat this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, huwa CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face+.
● Fl- 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, hu ħadem fuq sistema AI li rebqet l-ogħla attorney American Othello, u iktar tard sar eżekuttiv fir-Riċerka Microsoft u l-President tal-fergħa taċ-Ċina ta’ Google.

Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government donations, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking away the leaders of the academics; it's the corporations," said Lee.
The Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes in the immigration policy could also help U.S. to strengthen the efforts of the U.S.A.
"I think that green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI," he said.
The State Council of China issued its Next Generation Artifiċjali Development Plan for Intelligence Intelligence in July 2017.
● The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations have to spend money to researchers in the United States, but quality of the work of academicism is lower in China, says Lee.
Primarjament ta’ din is-sena, id-Dipartiment tad-Difiża tal-Istati Uniti stabbilixxa Ċentru Konġunt għall-Intelligence Artifiċjali, li huwa maħsub biex jinvolvi msieħba mill-industrija u l-akkademja, u l-White House ħabbar il-ħolqien ta’ Kumitat Għażla dwar l-Intelligence Artifiċjali.

Greece, li għandha provinċja msejħa Macedonia, tistqarr li l-isem tal-ġirier tagħha tat-Tramuntana jirrappreżenta talba f’territorjuha u veveved its entry into NATO u EU.
The two Governments qabbdu ftehim f’Ġunju ibbażat fuq l-isem il-ġdid propost, iżda l-opposers nazzjonalisti jargumentaw li l-bidla se tolleraha l-identità ethnica tal-maġġoranza tal-maġġoranza tal-Maċedonja Slavika.
President Gjorge Ivanov qal li ma kienx se jkun vot waqt ir-referendum u kampanja ta’ boycott qajmet dubji dwar jekk il-bidla kinitx se tilħaq il-minimu ta’ 50% meħtieġ sabiex ir-referendum ikun valid.
Il-mistoqsija dwar l-elezzjoni tar-referendum read: “Are you for NATO and membership in the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Dawk li jappoġġaw il-bidla fl-isem, inkluż il-Prim Ministru Zoran Zaev, jargumentaw li huwa prezz ta’ min iħallas biex wieħed isegwi l-ammissjoni f’korpi bħall-UE u NATO għall-Maċedonja, wieħed mill-pajjiżi li joħorġu mill-wasla tal-Jugoslavja.

The Rockies clinced at least a wild card spot with 5-2 rebha over the Nationals on Friday night, but still looking to shut down their first title of division.
"Although we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to ignite the rudder knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other group will be playing probably at the highest level of any point I'd face this year.
Why don't I want to compete in that?"
Nationals have yet to announce starter for Sunday, but reportedly they are inclined to let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who was about to start his 34th, threw a session on Thursday and was going to be on his normal rest Sunday.

Now they are top of the table, the only side of the ten that has not yet been left.
Fl-aħħar nett, it was their supreme دفاع, insofar as they took advantage of the best chances, which took home and coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be pleased.
"Since we've been tested over our games so far, and we're still unremained, so I've got to be happy," he said.
Said Robin Christie of Melrose: “Credit to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did.”
Grant Anderson’s 14-minute attempt, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but, card yellow for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, released for the game by warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers tell, and Jason Baggot took an unconverted attempt.
● Climo stretched the lead of Ayr with a penalty, before, right over half time, u mbagħad kitbu solo, trying to make it 17-5 to Ayr in the break.

Daga r-riżultati reċenti ta’ din is-sena ta’ esperiment, nistgħu naraw li l-lingwi qed jiġu installati bit-tabelli tal-konvenzjoni, bl-ogħla rati ta’ pass within schools indipendenti.
● A total ta’ 68 fil-mija ta’ studenti li studjaw lingwi barranin kisbu grade A ogħla.
Id-data, miġbura minn 74 skejjel membri tas-SCIS, showed li 72% tal-istudenti kisbu grade A ogħla f’Mandarin, filwaqt li 72 fil-mija ta’ dawk li jistudjaw il-Germanja, 69 fil-mija minn dawk li jistudjaw bil-Franċiż u 63 fil-mija li jistudjaw l-Ispanjol kisbu wkoll A.
This demonstrates that in Scotland, independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as skills vital that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Il-lingwati issa, bħala għażla suġġett, qed jinżammu fl-istess qasam bħall-individwi tal-STEM (xjenza, technology, engineering and mathematics) fi skolas indipendenti u f’postijiet oħra.
● Studji tal-Kummissjoni għall-Impjiegi u l-Ħiliet tar-Renju Unit fl-2014 stabbiliet li, għal raġunijiet li ppermettew min iħaddem biex jitħabat fil-postijiet vakanti, 17 fil-mija kienu attributi għal nuqqas ta’ ħiliet fil-lingwi.
Għalhekk, iktar and more, il-ħiliet fil-lingwa qed isiru urġenti sabiex iż-żgħażagħ ikunu lesti għal karriera fil-futur.
Whereas b’iktar opportunitajiet ta’ impjieg prospettivi li jeħtieġu lingwi, dawn il-ħiliet huma essenzjali f’dinja globalizzata.
** Ikun xi jkun il-karriera li xi ħadd chooses, jekk ikunu tgħallmu lingwa oħra, se jkollhom vantaġġ حقيقي fil-ġejjieni li għandhom ħiliet twal tali.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person multilingual before il-kompetizzjoni.
Skond YouGov’s YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 fil-mija ma setgħux jitkellmu lingwa barranija sew biżżejjed biex jitkellmu, u bil-lingwa الفرنسيa hija l-unika lingwa li jitkellmu b’perċentwali double-diġitte, 15 fil-mija.
ولهذا السبب, putting the investment into teaching the language now is important for today’s children.
* Having multilingual languages, b’mod partikolari dawk tal-ekonomiji li qed jiżviluppaw, se equip children with a better chance of finding employment meaningfully.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in the languages they teach.
* Għadd ta’ skejjel se jiffokaw fuq il-lingwi moderni iktar klassiċi, filwaqt li oħrajn se jgħallmu lingwi li huma meqjusin bħala l-aktar importanti għar-Renju Unit meta wieħed iħares 'l quddiem sal-2020, bħall-Mandarin jew il-Ġappuniżi.
مهما kien interess ta’ wliedek, dejjem se jkun hemm għadd ta’ lingwi għall-għażla minn ġewwa l-iskejjel indipendenti, filwaqt li l-istaff ta’ tagħlim li huma speċjalisti f’dan il-qasam.
● Skoċċiż schools indipendenti huma dedikati biex jipprovdu ambjent ta’ tagħlim li jipprepara lill-tfal u jqassmuhom bil-ħiliet meħtieġa biex jirnexxi, no matter what the future holds.
Joining the country’s future cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vitally important for the future of the country, so that this must be mirrored in education.
Indeed, il-lingwa moderna għandha حقا titqies bħala "il-ħiliet internazzjonali fil-qasam tal-komunikazzjoni".
Ultimate schools will continue to offer this choice, تنوع and excellence for young people of Scotland.
The favorite bien le faire.

It's the first of five of Trump's rallies scheduled for the next week, including stops in places friendly, including Tennessee u Mississippi.

Imma l-mira ewlenija ta’ dan it-tip ta’ rallies is to help Repubblikans facing the touch of the elections in November get some momentum.
Għalhekk, campaign President Trump said that these five rallies in the next week are aimed at “energising volunteers and supporters as the Repubblikans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives”, according to Reuters.

"It's not a good sign for Morrisy that President has to come to try to boost him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, scientist politiku at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Joe Ryder Cup 2018: Team juri l-istonku tal-Istati Uniti tal-Amerika għall-ġlieda biex iżomm il-possibbiltajiet ħajjin lejn l-individwi tal-Ħadd.
*After three sessions of one side, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon may just have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing pendulum of momentum is a concept sportiv kompletament invented but one that the players really believe in, never more than in such competitions.
So where would they say that the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so we carry that as a little momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth while he was plundered for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead, with 12 others playing.
“ The Americans, as Spieth says, feels that they have a little wind in their ships, although they have plenty to encourage, mhux least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each boasting three points out of four.
Spieth has been murdered from tan to green and is led by example.
Dawn il - صرخات taʼ l - għaġla taʼ l - osservanza żdiedت ጮኸا hekk kif roundsu kompla, whilst singinging a crucial place to match four-squarters when he and Thomas were two down after two.
His view of winning them match at 15 was met with a similar shout, the kind he tells you he believes that the American team is not out of this.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your match," said Spieth.
All these players left now.
18 holes to make marks.
The only players with more than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, l-istorja indisputable of the Ryder Cup.
Koppji odds but adorablei ta’ l-Ewropa huma 4 minn kull 4 u ma jistgħux jagħmlu xi ħaġa ħażina.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who would not shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also evitaw bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, u l-għada ta' noon il-Ġimgħa.
Which run, and the way their energy flows to and from this boisterous crowd cements that they are the players to hit Sunday, and no more player popolari biex jiftaħ rebħa Ewropea potenzjali hekk kif sun sunk over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Speaking of European glory remains premature, however.
”; Buba Watson u Webb Simpson did short work for Sergio Garcia, hero of the morning four balls, when he was married to Alex Noren.
A bogey and two-two-two-two in front of the nine ignited the Spaniard and the Swede into hole li qatt ma resqueled biex jeopardjaw.
However, Sunday, no one will help you out of your hole.
The four balls and foursomes are so exciting to watch closely because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they give them, and the way a strategy can change instantly.
Europe has played aħjar bħala a team so far, taking lead b’mod sinifikanti fl-aħħar jum, but this foursomething session has also shown that the team of the United States of America has stomach for the fight that some, especially Stateside, had doubts.
Europe takes 10-6 lead into the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will take advantage b’saħħithom għall-aħħar day of the Ryder Cup after it has evolved mill-Fourthballs of Saturday and foursomes match 10-6 lead over the United States.
● Inspired duo Tomy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a tiger struggling Woods to take their talent so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European side, inviting them to retain the thromby they lost in Hazeltine sentejn ago, dominated side American misunderstanding in the morning four balls, taking serje 3-1.
The U.S. offset further resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but they could not eat in the deficit.
For Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from the 12-month singles of Sunday matches to maintain the thromby.
Joe Fleetwood is the first European Rookie to win four points in row, while he and Molinari, bubbed "Molliwood" after weekend sensory, were only the second couple to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
* Having crushed the Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls they glanced superbly to beat a devastating Woods and American Rookie Brison Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5&4.
* Woods, who ignited himself through two matches on Saturday, showed occasionally bursts of brownness but issa lost 19 out of 29 matches in four balls and foursomes and seven in row.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning four balls, returned to the partner Henriik Stenson in the foursomes to a defeat of 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, rank wieħed u three in the world.
Europe was not in their own way, though it was a day of pleasantness, brilliant southwest of Paris.
Johannes Spieth and Justin Thomas, rebbieħ prinċipali, tliet times, stabbilixxa l-parametru referenzjarju għall-Amerikani b’żewġ punti nhar is-Sibt.
Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the four balls rebħu grazziness 2&1, u reġgħu reġgħu reġgħu beaten Poulter u Rory McIlroy 4&3 fl-erbaʼ odds li tilfu l-żewġ holes tal-ftuħ.
A team resquashed from a deficit ta’ 4 punti, although, as holders of the Furyk’s side, need to draw only so as to retain the thromby.
However, after being the second best for two days, Sunday counter-attack seems to be beyond them.
North Korea says "No way" لن تنزع السلاح unilaterally بدون fiduċja
U.S.A., U.S. Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that on Saturday, continuing جزاءات كانت تعميق ثقتها في الولايات المتحدة.
Um, Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly annually of the World Body that North Korea has taken “measures of goodwill of importance” in the past year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, dismantlement of the site of nuclear testing, and promise not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "Sovereignly, we don't see any response correspondingly from U.S.A."
"Huwa mingħajr ebda fiduċja fl-Istati Uniti, m'hu se jkun hemm ebda fiduċja fis-sigurtà nazzjonali tagħna, u f'dawn iċ-ċirkustanzi m'hemm l-ebda mod li bih b'mod unilaterali se nneħħu lilna nfusna first."
Filwaqt li Ri vendetta complaints familiari fil-Korea ta’ Fuq dwar l-oppożizzjoni ta’ Washington lejn a “phased” approach to denuclearization under which North Korea will be rewarded as it took steps تدريجيا, his statement appeared to be significant because it did not reject denuclearization unilaterali out of hand as Pyongyang did in the past.
ባዕሉ Ri rrefera għal stqarrija konġunta maħruġa minn Kim Jong Un u Donald Trump fl-ewwel summit qattiela bejn President U.S. Service and leader tal-Korea ta’ Fuq f’Singapore f’Junju 12, meta Kim pledged to work towards “denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised garanziji dwar is-sigurtà tal-Korea ta’ Fuq.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 War of Korea, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Johannesburg, Washington, ukoll, oppona wkoll sejħa biex jintervjeni عقوبات internazzjonali iebsa fuq North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on the “denuclearisation-first” and increases l-livell ta’ pressjoni by جزاءs to achieve its purpose in a manner forced, and even to object to “declaration of the end of war”,” Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions could lead us to knees is a pipeline dream for people who do not know about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our lack of confidence."
ري لم يذكر pjanijiet għal a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the leader of the United States highlighted at the United Nations prematurely in the week.
Minflok, il-Ministru enfasizza tliet laqgħat bejn Kim u South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months u żied: “If the party to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock.”
Minkejja dan, il-kliem ta’ Ri differed b’mod drammatiku mis-sena ta’ wara, meta qal lill-American General Assembly of the United States that the targeting of the U.S. mainland with rockets of North Korea was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim "Man Rocket" on a mission of suicide.
* Din is-sena at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened "to destroy totalment" North Korea last year, helded praise to Kim for his courage in taking steps toنزع السلاح, but said that much work still needed to be done, and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
Wednesday, Trump qal li ma kellux qafas ta’ żmien għal dan, saying, "If it takes two years, three or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia jargumentaw li l-Kunsill tas-Sigurtà tal-Istati Uniti għandu jippremja Pyongyang għall-passi meħuda.
However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of the United States told the United States Security Council of America on Thursday: “Effective of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue b’mod vigorous and unblemied until we realize fully, final, verified denuclearization."
● Il-Kunsill tas-Sigurtà saħħaħ b’mod unanimu جزاءات على North Korea since 2006, owing to cutting off funding for the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of Pyongyang.
● Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the United States General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again fil-bill.
pompeo visited North Korea three times already this year, but l-aħħar vjaġġ tiegħu ma marx tajjeb.
Hu telaq lil Pyongyang f’Lulju, billi qal li sar progress.
..North Korea, at a meeting with Moon this month, تعهدت li tneħħi موقع missile kif ukoll kumpless nukleari jekk l-Istati Uniti ħadet “miżuri ta’ korrezzjoni”.
He said that Kim told him the “measures of correction” that he was looking for were guarantees of security Trump pledged in Singapore and moves towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard take the course to get enough rest.
..kors ġdid at Harvard University this year, l-istudenti gradwati kollha tiegħu kisbu iktar sleep f’offerta biex jiġġieldu kontra l-kultura li qed tikber ta’ macho ta’ studju permezz ta’ caffeine-fuelled 'all nights.'
Uħud akkademiċi li nstabu studenti fl-għadd wieħed ta’ università fid-dinja spiss ma tantx jifhmu meta يتعلق بالمبادئ الأساسية dwar kif wieħed jieħu ħsieb نفسه.
Charles Czeisler, professur tal-mediċina tal-irqad at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, ppjana l-kors, li hu jemmen li l-ewwel wieħed minnhom huwa l-Istati Uniti.
Hu ġie mnebbaħ biex jibda l - kors wara li jagħti taħdita dwar l-impatt tal-privileġġ fuq il-lettering.
"Then at the end of it came to me one girl and said, 'Why is this just that told me now, in my old year?'"
Murdrily, she said, "Nobody has ever told her about the importance of sleep -- which surpriseed me,' he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was rolled for the first time this year, explains to the students the essentials of how good sleep habits help to perform akkademics and athletics, as well as to improve their overall welfare.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatrics at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services of the university, said that university decided to introduce kors wara li l-istudenti sabu li l-irqad ma kienx imċaħħad serjament matul il-ġimgħa.
Il-kors fit-tul tal-ħin jinvolvi serje ta’ kompiti تفاعلية.
F’parti waħda, hemm immaġinazzjoni ta’ kamra ta’ l-irqad, fejn students jaqbżu fuq cups of coffee, curtains, trainees, u kotba li għandhom jintqal dwar l-effetti ta’ caffeine and light and how performance atletic is affected by a lack of sleep, and the importance of routine sleeping.
F’sezzjoni oħra, il-parteċipanti jintqalilhom kemm il-privileġġ tal-irqad fit-tul jista’ jżid ir-riskji ta’ attakki tal-qalb, stroke, depression, u kanċer.
Map of the campus, with icons interactive, then encourages the participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that it will not change behaviour of the student immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, Prof Czeisler added.
‫The culture of pride in ‘ plundering all nights’ still exists, he said, وأضاف li t-teknoloġija moderna u l-pressjoni dejjem tiżdied fuq students يعني a lack of sleep constituted a growing problem.
Ensure that you have sufficient sleep, of a good quality, should be 'arm secrete' of a student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid wearing a weight, as a lack of sleep puts brain into a mode of starvation, making them hungry constantly.
.. Raymond So, a 19-year-old Kalifornjan li jistudja l-kimika u l-bijoloġija fiżika, għen lill-Professur Czeisler biex ifassal il-kors, billi ħa wieħed mill-klassijiet tiegħu last year matul his first year at Harvard.
Hu qal li l-kors kien fetaħ għajnejh u inspired him to push for a course all over the campus.
He hopes in the next step, in order to ask all students postgraduates to complete a similar study programme before they join the institution kompetittiv.
Il-Prof Czeisler irrakkomandat li l-istudenti għandhom jikkunsidraw setting an alarm for when to go to bed, kif ukoll meta to wake up, u jkunu konxji tal-ħsara ta’ ‘blue light’ li titfasslu minn screens elettroniċi u LED lighting, which can throw your circadian rhythm out of kilter, leading to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Menga downsizes men of Gerrard
● Rangers soffered another buffet of blues away from day after day, peress li l - attakk taʼ Dolly Menga kkastiga lil Steven Gerrard’s dissociated side to defeat 1-0 at Livingston.
>The Ibrox side looked to record their first victory on the road since rebha 4-1 ta’ Frar at St. Johnstone, but the Gary Holt's team ignited the second defeat of Gerrard just in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points admirable to runway Ladbrokes Premiership Leaders Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time and a Rangers line-up short on aspiration never looked like a leveling.
While Rangers are now down to 6th spot, Livingston climbs to 3rd and only behind Hibernian on the difference in goal.
U jista’ jkun hemm iktar diffikultà fil-ħażna għal Rangers wara li l-konverġenza Calum Spence, li kellu jiġi trattat minħabba l-feriti ta’ ras wara li oġġett milli jidher ġie رمي mill-aħħar.
Gerrard għamel tmien tibdiliet fuq in-naħa tal-imgħoddi Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt went along with the same Livi 11 that took a point off the hearts week الماضي, and he would have been pleased with the way in which his well-delighted garment suffocated their opponents at every turn.
▸ Rangers may have dominated the possession, but Livingston did more with the ball they owned.
Huma kellhom jikkalkulaw biss 2 minuti meta Menga's first-time offshore sent Scott Pittman through on Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder grabbed his big chance wider.
A deep Keaghan Jacobs free-kick then sab Craig Halckett but Alan Lithgou, lis-sieħeb difensive tiegħu, seta’ jaqbad b’mod wiesa’ fil-post ta’ wara.
* Rangers grabbed control, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their plays in the final third.
* Alfredo Morelos ċertament li ħass li kellu jkollu l-piena fuq il-marka ta’ erba’ sigħat meta hu u Steven Lawless allied, but the referendum Steven Thomson qered l-appelli tal-Kolombjani.
● Rangers managed biss two-half-ewwel shots fuq il-mira, iżda liam Kelly, former Ibrox goalkeeper, liam Kelly, ftit li xejn ħassu mħassba minħabba Lasanna Coulibaly's head and a tame Ovie Ejaria strike.
While Livi’s opener-minute 34-minute may have been against the running of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it waħedhom.
* Rangers once again naqsu in dealing with a set-up of deep Jacobs.
● Scott Arfield ma rreaġixxax hekk kif Declan Gallagher slipped the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept cool enough to pick Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard ħa azzjoni matul il- break waqt li kien qed jaqbad Koulibaly għal Ryan Kent, u l-bidla kważi tat impatt immedjat hekk kif ittieħed it in Morelos, iżda Kelly, li jispikka, tigried mill-linja tiegħu għal  block.
Imma Livingston kompliet treddaʼ lill - viżitaturi biex jilagħbu eżattament dak li jgawdu, b’lithgou u Halket jaqtgħu  ball twil wara balla twila.
Amma McGregor qagħad tajjeb biex jiċħad Jacobs qabel Litgou rasu wiesa’ mill-kantuniera.
* Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton kellu yet another talent late for a penalty while hu kien konfuż maʼ Jacobs, but Thomson reġaʼ ħares ’ il bogħod.

“When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given by the radioactivity in minerals.”

Kanye West Embarked on a Pro-Trump Diatribe, wearing a MAGA Hat, after his SNL Appearance.
Happily, it was not a good thing to go.
Kanye West was baked in the studio during Sibt Night Lives after a trench performance where he praised President Donald Trump of the United States and said he would run for office in 2020.
* After performing songه الثالث tal-lejl, which is called the Spirit Town, where he was wearing a Make America Great cap, he ran a pledge against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So often I talk to someone white and say, 'How can you like Trump, he races?'"
Well, had I been concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
● SNL nediet il-preżentazzjoni b’matt Damon, li fih Holywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Claims of the Sexual Attack by Christine Blasey Ford.
Għalkemm it was not broadcast, the footprint of the West's pledge was uploaded to the social media by Chris Rock camedian.
Huwa ċar li Rock qed jipprova j mock West by posting.
Barra minn hekk, West has complained to the audience that he had a hard time backstage about wearing his head.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that כובע on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I am in a place of sunrise, ” he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West West went on, "Do you want to see the sundown place?" said that he would "take up my superman's cap, because this means that you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
تعليقاته جذبت booos at least twice from the audience and from the SNL cast members appeared to be embarrassed, and Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: “The whole studio fell dead silently.”
Westwest was brought to replacement tard għall-kanzunetta Ariana Grande, li l-aħħar ħabib tagħha, Rapper Mac Miller, kien miet ftit jiem ago.
Westwestern puzzled many with the performance of the song I love, dressed as a Bottle of Perrier.
Westwest is backed by the head of the TPUSA Group of Conservatives, Candace Turner, who tied: “To one of the most boldest spirits: Thank you for slapping the MOB."
Imma l-konversazzjoni turi lill-ospitant Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being who he is and that's absolutely wonderful".
“Imma ma għażiltx li nirringrazzja lil xi ħadd (li jixtri l-mużika jew ilbies tiegħu jew li jappoġġa l-"art" tiegħu) li nemmen li japprova u jċapċpu l-ideoloġija li taffettwa lill-komunità tiegħi.
He is free.
So do we," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper in Twitter announced that he had changed his name, saying that he was now “the being formally known as Kanye West”.
He is not the first artist to change their name and follow in footsteps of Didi, magħruf ukoll bħala Puff Dady, Puffy and PDdy.

EUR. Waters Maxine deny staff who leaked data of GOP snakers, blasts 'false hazardous lies' and 'theories of conspiracy'.
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of staff her had posted the personal information of three republican American senators on Wikipedia’s Wekipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democract stqarr li l-klejms kienu qed jiġu ristretti permezz ta’ pundits u websajts “wings on the right hand”.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
.. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, kif ukoll Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
L-informazzjoni deheret online Thursday, posted by a stranger on Capitol Hill during the hearing of a Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against the appointe of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came xi żmien wara li t-tliet snakers questioned Kavanaugh.
● Il-websajts konservattivi bħall-Gateway Pundit and RedState reported li l-indirizz IP li jidentifika s-sors tal-postijiet kien assoċjat ma' uffiċċju Waters" and released the information of a member of the Waters staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded allegation is completely false and a absolute lie," the waters continued.
"Footman of my staff -- whose identity, information personali, and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations -- he was in no way responsible for leaking of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and a absolute lie."
Speakings of waters quickly drew criticism online, including from former secretary of the press of White House Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer kiteb: "This denial is angry," he wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, he or she must not be angry.
M’għandhomx ikunu stubborn.
M’għandhomx question the motives of the tax collector.
They must be calm and serene."

Johnny English Strikes Again review - responsive Rowan Atkinson spy sponof spy spy atkinson -
It is customary now to look for Brexit's significances in any film ġdid with a British saste, which appears to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English-comedy spoof-Franchise action - which reġaʼ beda fl-2003 with Johnny English and was sprawled back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the tongue-in-checked self-satiny on the subject of how rumor we are obviously the new opportunity of exportation of the nation?
* Fi kwalunkwe rata, il-pup-eyed Johnny English, facial incompetent with rubber-face, kellu l-liċenzja tiegħu li jġedded l-affarijiet għat-tieni darba -- l-isem tal-marka tiegħu aktar minn kwalunkwe ħaġa oħra li indika li huwa ħolqien komiku wiesa’ designed għal territorji li mhumiex jitkellmu bl-Ingliż.
بالطبع, huwa l-aġent sigriet li jaqtagħha li minkejja l-perspettiva tiegħu għal glamour smoothie, li rċieva ftit Clouseau, a scrap of Mr Bean and a dollop of that chap, li jagħti nota waħda lill-Karaots of Fire theme tunnellat at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
He's also originally based on the traveller and the international man of mystery Atkinson once played at the Barclaycard television ads now forgotten, leaving fragrances in his wake.
There are moments jew two sbieħ f’dan l-aħħar JE exit.
I love Johnny English approaching a helicopter whilst dressed in a suit of armor medjevali and the rotor bladder blankets that briefly click against the elephant.
‫His gift of Atkinson for a physical comedy is on display, but the Huur feels quite weak and superfluous, especially as marks of films “serious” like 007 and Mission incapable now offer a comedy as a ingredient.
The Huur feels as if it were placed on children rather than on adults, and for me, misadventures of Johnny English that are lovely are not inventive and concentrated as gangs of Atkinson silent-movie gangs in the person of Bean.
The premise perpetual topical now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
> A cyber-hacker infiltrate the super-secret web network of spies of Britain, revealing identifiers of all the agents of Britain in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty -- rwol sfortunatament żgħir għal Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is pompy and embasted figure, who has already suffered a total stigma of non-popularity politically: Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but there's nothing too much in the script to work with.
Historians of intelligence inform her that, as every spy active has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of retirement.
U dan ifisser li Johnny English himself, li issa qeda bħala għalliem f’xi post, iżda li jagħti lura l-lezzjonijiet dwar kif wieħed ikun agent hiding: some beautiful gangs here, as English offers academy of the Rock type of spying.
English is backed to Whitehall for briefings ta’ emerġenza, and reunited with his former long-suffering sidekick Bough, which Ben Miller reġaʼ played.
* Bough is now a married man, hit by a commander submarine, a role of jolly-hockey-stecks where Vicki Pepperdine is a bit lost.
So the Batman and Robin of getting things wrong terrifyingly wrong at the Secret Service of Majesty are back in action, meeting Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful killer of Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, Primary Minister is falling b’mod perikoluż taħt il-play of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims li jista’ jsolvi l-iżbalji tal-kompjuter ta’ Britannja: sinister Jason Volta, li Jake Lacy, played.
English and Bough start their odyssey of high-speaking genes: disgusted as waiters, they fired to a flash French restaurant; they create fantasy to embark on board the luxury of Volta; and English triggers anarchy pure as he attempts to use a Virtual Real Heads to familiarize himself with the inside of the house of Volta.
Bla dubju, all the stops are pulled out for the last sequence, but, as friendly and boosteric as it is, there are quite a few TV kids's TV about the whole thing.
Pretty moderate stuff.
And as with other films of Johnny English, ma stajtx naħseb: l-industrija tal-films Britannika ma tistax tagħti Rowan Atkinson rwol li verament jagħmel ġustizzja lill-talent tiegħu?
Work denies that work is planning a plan for Britons to work four days a week but to pay for five days.
The Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is to consider pjan radikali li se jara Britons work for four days a week -- but to be paid for five.
It was reported that the party wanted li l-mexxejja tal-kumpanija pass on the savings made through the revolt intelligence artifiċjali (AI) to the workers by giving them extra day off.
It would see the employees enjoy weekend ta’ three days - but still take home the same wage.
Sources said that the idea would be "fair" with the party’s economic agenda and plans to tile the country in favour of the workers.
● Shift to week of four days has been endorsed by the Conference of the Trade Union as a way for the workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
* Sors tal-Poplu tax-Xogħol seniori qal The Sunday Times: ‘Should a review tal-politika jiġi mħabbat qabel tmiem is-sena.
'It won't happen night by night, but week tax-xogħol ta' erbat ijiem huwa aptit li jaqbel mal-approċċ tal-parti għar-ribalanciment tal-ekonomija favur il-ħaddiem kif ukoll mal-istrateġija الصناعية ġenerali tal-parti.'
‫The Party of Labour will not be the first to endorse such an idea, while the Green Party will pledge ġimgħa tax-xogħol ta’ erbat ijiem matul il-kampanja ta’ electoral generali tagħha għall-2017.
At the present time, however, it is not endorsed by the Party of Labour as a whole.
Helen spokesman of the Party of Labour said: "Four-day working week is not a party policy and isn't considered by the party."
● Shadow Chancel John McDonnell uża l-konferenza tax-xogħol tal-ġimgħa ta’ qabel biex jesprimi l-viżjoni tiegħu għal rivoluzzjoni soċjali fl-ekonomija.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to curb back power from 'directors without face' and 'profecters' at the utli firms.
The shadow's pjanijiet also mean shareholders present in the water companies may not return to their whole stake, as a government of labour can make 'deductions' minħabba l-iżbalji perceived.
He confirmed ukoll pjanijiet biex ipoġġu ħaddiema fil-bords tal-kumpaniji u biex joħolqu Funds Inklussive Property to hand 10 per cent of the equity of private sector companies to employees, who stand at pocket dividends annually up to 500 £.
j. Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, jgħid "60 minutes" jekk investigative FBI ta’ Kavanaugh could change their minds.
) Il-investigazzjoni FBI dwar اتهامات ضد Imħallef Brett Kavanaugh delayed تصويت finali fuq id-deżinjazzjoni tiegħu quddiem il-Qorti Suprema ta’ l-inqas ġimgħa, u tqajjem il-mistoqsija dwar jekk ir-riżultati tal-Bureau jistgħux jaqtgħu lil kwalunkwe snap Repubblikan biex jiġbdu l-appoġġ tagħhom.
Johannes Kennedy and Lindsey Graham in interview bl-ajru on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley, "60 minutes", asked the Republicans Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, jekk FBI could unify anything li would lead them to change their minds.
● Kennedy נראתה iktar miftuħa minn sħabu minn South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said that I would go to the hearing, I said, I have spoken to Judge Kavanau.
I called him after this, that allegation arose, and said, "Hast thou done it?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal."
However, il-votazzjoni ta’ Graham tidher imwaħħla mal-ġebel.
"My mind is about Brett Kavanaugh and it will take a dinamite charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it بشدة," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone whose names she names she was not able to verify.
She's 36 years old.
"I don't see anything new change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has Anything Done to Destroy Poverty?
* Din is-Sibt, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event of music having a line-up eċċezzjonali enormi ta’ כוכבi li jwettqu u missjoni eċċitanti daqstant; ending the world’s poverty.
والآن, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real objective of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen Festival, which stated in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of advocacy international that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who fight hard against it.
● To get ticket free for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volontarja, embarkation of a world leader, making a call on the world, or any other means meaningful to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
Imma kemm jirnexxilha l - Global Citizen li dam 12-il sena biex tilħaq il - mira tiegħu?
Il-kunċett ta’ rewarding people with free concerts is a true way to persuade people to call for action, or just another case of the so-called "clicktivism" -- nies feel as if they make a difference really by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, iċ-Ċitzen Globali jgħid li since 2011, din irreġistrat iktar minn 19 miljun “actions” mill-appoġġaturi tagħha, pushing for a host of different goals.
تذكر li dawn l-azzjonijiet għenu lill-mexxejja tad-dinja biex jipproklamaw impenji u سياسات li jammontaw għal iktar minn $37 billion, li huma stabbiliti biex jaffettwaw lives ta’ iktar minn 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Fil-bidu tal-2018, il-grupp irrefera għal 390 impenji u إعلانi li jirriżultaw mill-azzjonijiet tiegħu, li minnhom mill-inqas 10 billion dollars diġà tefgħu jew tqassmu.
● Il-grupp estimate li l-fondi garantititi s’issa kellhom impatt dirett fuq kważi 649 miljun ruħ madwar id-dinja.
U.S.A., some mill-impenji ewlenin jinkludu The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based on the U.K. of investors and implementers committed “to help children grow to their full potential”, promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“By the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a concert living in London in April 2018.
Il-grupp qal ukoll li wara li saru iktar minn 5,000 actions called for U.K. to improve the nutritionalization of mothers and children, il-gvern ħabbar تمويل għal مشروع, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with interventions on nutrition.
* Responding to one of the FQSs on its websites, he asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Johannesburg, a citizen of the world, answered: "It will be a long and hard way -- sometimes we shall fall and fail.
ولكن, like the great rights Civilian and anti-partheid movements ahead of us, we will be successful, given that we are stronger together.
j. Janet Jackson, Weekly, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the acts performed in the event of this year in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Ley Furness and Hugh Jackman.
USA can use Navy for "blockade" to impediment the exports of energy Russian -- Segretarju intern --
Washington jista’ “jekk ikun hemm bżonn” jirrikorri għall-Navy tiegħu to prevent the Russian energy from hit the markets, including in the Middle East, Secretary-General Intern of the United States Ryan Zinke has revealed, as mentioned by Washington Examiner.
Amma Zinke allega li l-parteċipazzjoni tar-Russja fis-Sirja -- l-aktar, fejn taħdem bi دعوة mill-gvern leġittimu -- hija a pretense for esploration of new markets of energy.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to broker energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, ሆדת جنوب Europe," reportedly.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea sea lakes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
● Zinke was addressing attendees of the event hosted by the Alliance of Energy of the Consumer, a group of non-profits that styles itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
Mur biex iqabbel l-approċċi ta’ Washington għall-kura tar-Russja u l-Iran, noting li huma l-istess b’mod effettiv.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia, over or less, is torturing and replacing fuels," he said, filwaqt li jirreferi għar-Russja bħala "trick pony" b'ekonomija li tiddependi fuq fossil fuels.
Id-dikjarazzjonijiet li ġejjin bħala l-amministrazzjoni ta’ Trump kienu fuq missjoni biex isaħħaħ l-esportazzjoni tal-gass naturali liquefied tagħha lejn l-Ewropa, billi replacing Russia, l-għażla l-aktar cheapa għall-konsumaturi Ewropej.
F’dak il-għan, uffiċjali tal-amministrazzjoni Trump, including President Donald Trump of the United States himself, jipprovaw convince Germany that it would pull out of the “inadequate” project Nord Stream 2, pipeline, which according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's "captive".
weliba Moscow enfasizzat ripetutament li l-pajpline ta’ $11 billion Nord Stream 2, li huwa stabbilit biex jirdoppja l-kapaċità ta’ pipeline eżistenti għal 110 billion meters kubiċi, huwa مشروع פשוט ekonomiku.
The Kremlin targumenta li l-oppożizzjoni qawwija ta’ Washington għall-proġett hija mqanqla sempliċement għal raġunijiet ekonomiċi u hija eżempju ta’ kompetizzjoni inġusta.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise the pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said the Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting with the US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has drawn backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Germany’s leading organization for industry, Federation of Industries German (BDI), called upon the US to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a problem when a third state interferes with our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of the German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between Chancler German Angela Merkel and President Russian Vladimir Putin.

Dawn l-affarijiet cannot be reverted," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
He said Reeher that he doubted the last minute's push of the Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to placate vocabulants angry.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, konsulent seniori u kelliemi nazzjonali għall-grupp progressive MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
يوم الجمعة صباحا, protesters smashed "November is coming!" kif urew fil - Hall of the Senate as the Repubblikans controlling the Judicial Committee chose to move forward with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic.
“L-entużjażmu demokratiku u l-motivazzjoni se jkunu off the chart”, Stu Rothenberg, analyst politiku non-participant, qal il-websajt.
"People are saying that it was already high; that's true.
But it may be higher, particularly among women who vote in the suburbs and minor voters, 18-19-year-old, who, while they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before the public testimony of Ford detailing its allegations of sexual assault against the nominate of the Supreme Court, analysts suggested li anonymous complaint could follow if the Republicans were forwarded with confirmation.
"Dan sar a mudde for the GOP," said Michael Steele, li qabel kien chairman tal-Kumitat Nazzjonali Republican, qabel il-ġimgħa ta’ l-aħħar, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the Committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is placed on the bench, it's also about the way the Repubblikans handled this and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities of the United States of America, a group that helps to select Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, الأمريكيون  seem to be a bit split over whom to believe in the wake of the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more toilet with the latter.
A essay ġdid minn YouGov juri li 41% من respondents żgur jew probabbilment emmnu testimony of Ford, filwaqt li 35% said they definitely jew probabbilment believed Kavanaugh.
Barra minn hekk, 38 per cent said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his witnessing, filwaqt li 30 per cent just said the same about Ford.
* Wara l-imbolu ta’ Flake, il-FBI bħalissa qed investigat l-allegations imressqa minn Ford as well as at least one taxier ieħor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian, reported.
● Ford testified quddiem il-Kumitat Judicial Judicial Senate under oath week שעבר li Kavanaugh attakka lil Kavanaugh sakhra at age 17.
Amma Ramirez allegatament li l-imħallef tal-Qorti Suprema عرّف lilha l-ġenitali tiegħu waqt li attendew a party matul il-ħin tagħhom studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The Inventory of the World Wide Web Plans to Start a New Internet for Using Google and Facebook
* Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a start-up that seeks rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, is the latest project of the technology legend, inrupt, is a company that builds off the open source platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows the users to choose where data is stored and what people are allowed to have access to what information.
* F’intervista esklussiva ma’ Fast Company, Berners-Lee qal li l-intenzjoni ta’ wara Inrupt is “domination of the world”.
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
"It's a historical moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal data store on the Internet” or POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, to-do lists, calendar, libraries mużika and other personal and professional tools.
г It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are available on one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal data store on the Internet is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "the empowerment of the person through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes and skills appropriate to help make Solid available to everyone.
>The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a platform for security that IBM purchased, some developers on-the-staff kuntrattu to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, developers tat-teknoloġija madwar id-dinja jistgħu joħolqu apps deċentralised tagħhom stess billi jużaw l-għodod disponibbli on the Inrupt website.
He and his team were not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models are fully updated overnight.
"We do not ask for permission from them."
● F’post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "The mission of Inrupt is to provide energy kummerċjali and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
Fl-1994, Berners-Lee biddel l-Internet meta stabbilixxa The World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
* F’dawn l-aħħar xhur, Bernners-Lee was a voice influenced in the debate on neutrality net.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm optimistic incredibly for this age next of the web", added Bernners-Lee.
Burnard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross cleric celebrated
The only clergyman of England to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior was celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
j. Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann rebaħ il-premju fid-29 ta’ Settembru 1918 fl-attakk ta’ Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Madankollu, erbat ijiem wara, a sniper killed him, u qatt ma kien jaf li kien rebaħ l-akbar شرف militari Britanniku.
* Il-ġurnata ta’ l-ifkira ta’ l-imsemmija ġiet inkluda minn żewġ grandparents tiegħu f’paragraph f’Rushden, Northamptonshire, السبت.
One of grandparents, Michael Vann, said that it was “symbolically simboliku b’mod ċar” li l-ġebel kien se jiġi muri eżattament 100 years wara l-premju mill-awefulness of grandpa.
Skond The London Gazette, fid-29 ta’ Settembru 1918, Lt Col Vann mexxa l-batterija tiegħu madwar il-Kanal de Saint-Quentin “through a tempesti ħoxna ħafna u taħt nar qawwi mill-qasam u mill-armi tal-magni”.
Iktar tard, hu għaġġel lejn il-linja tar-rotazzjoni u bil-"maximu-kbar gallantry" wassal il-linja quddiem qabel ma dam a field-gun b'idejn waħda u ħabbat tlieta mill-waqfien.
Lut Col Vann ġie maqtul permezz ta’ sniper Ġermaniż fl-4 ta’ Ottubru 1918 — iktar minn xahar biss qabel tmiem الحرب.
Michael Vann, li għandu 72 sena, qal li l-azzjonijiet ta’ Grandpa tiegħu kienu “xi ħaġa li naf li qatt ma stajt ngħix b’mod uniformi imma b’xi ħaġa li hi meek.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid up an arrogance after the parade, led by the Brintwood Youth Imperial Ban.
41. Michael Vann qal li hu “liberu ħafna biex jieħu sehem fil-paradju” u żied:“Il-qawwa ta’ hero veru qed tiġi murija mill-appoġġ li se jingħata minn ħafna nies.”
The MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, they got Pepa Pig instead of Pig Pig.
Imagine this, you stayed up all night to watch the 206 Bellator packed only to be denied to watch the main event.
The bill from San Jose contained 13 قتbs, inklużi 6 قتbs fuq kard prinċipali, u qed jiġi muri li kienu jgħixu matul il-lejl fir-Renju Unit fuq Channel 5.
* At 6am, just as Gegard Muusasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, sorprises fir - Renju Unit baqgħu sorpriżi meta l - kopertura nbidlet għal Pepa Pig.
Uħud minnhom لم يتأثروا بعدما بقيوا مستيقظين sal-bidu tas-siegħa, speċjalment għall-gwerra.
Wieħed fan on Twitter iddeskriva l-bidla lejn il-kartuna tat-tfal bħala “xi kind of joke sick”.
"It's government regulation that, at 6 a.m., that content was not suitable so that they had to switch to the programming of children, " said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president Bellator of the marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Pepa the pig," yes.
The President of the Bellator Company Scott Coker said that they were going to work on their schedules to include in future UK watchings.
"I think that when I think about the repository, I think that we may probably be able to handle it," said Coker.
"But it's 6 a.m. a.m., a.m., a.m., a.m., a.m., but it's 6 a.m., a Sunday, and we'll not be able to do this until Sunday we have a time, Monday, their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when it changed, there was a lot of texts back and forth, and all of them were not friendly.
We were trying to fix it, and we thought it was a technical glance.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of government.
I can promise you the next time it will not happen.
We'll keep it up to five battles instead of six -- like us normally -- and we tried to overdo the fans overload, and we just passed over.
It's a state of unfortunate."
< Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' over sexuality
* Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling below everyone because of his sexuality — but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
Said l-ieħor, li għandu 24 sena, li ma fehemx sakemm jattendi l-iskola sekondarja li "mhux everyone like me."
● Speaking on the first Radio 4 Discs on Island Desert by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke of the rights gay to give others "hope".
Hu qal ukoll li becoming a parent جعلني him less careful about winning the Olympics.
* Il-preżentazzjoni regulari tal-preżentazzjoni fit-tul, Kirsty Young, ħa diversi xhur offset minħabba l-marda.
● Looking at the first program of Laverne, Daley, who seemed like a roadblock on the first programme of Laverne, said that he felt “less than” everyone else who grew up because “it was not acceptable socially to the like of boys and girls”.
He said: "To date, those feelings of feeling less than those, and feels different, were the real things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
* Il-medallist Olympic Bronze twice sar kampanja tal-LGBT ta’ profil għoli u uża d-dehra tiegħu fil-Conwealth Games of this year in Australia to appeal for more countries to discriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and to give others “tama”.
The three-time champion of the world said that he fell in love with a man -- US Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 -- "wasteed me in a surprise."
Daley żżewweġ lil rebbieħ Oscar, li għandu 20 sena, fl-età tiegħu, fl-aħħar sena, iżda qal li d-differenza fl-età qatt ma kienet kwistjoni.
"When you're going through such a youth" -- went to his first Olympics 14 -- and father died of cancer three years later -- said that it was difficult to find someone like that age who had experienced similar elevations and lowests.
Dawn l-irġiel saru ġenituri f’Ġunju, lil tifel jismu Robert Ray Black-Daley, u Daly said that his “perspettiva sħiħa” had changed.
"If you had asked me a question in the past year, it was all about 'I need to win a medal of gold'," he said.
"You know what, hemm affarijiet akbar minn medals ta’ gold Olympic.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
Ultimately, Ibnu għandu l-istess isem bħal missieru Robert, li miet fl-2011, li kellu 40 sena wara li ġie diagnosed b’kanċer tal-moħħ.
Said Daley: “Dalie, he did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether he had their tickets yet for London 2012 -- kif ried li jkun on the front row.
"Ma stajtx ngħid לו, 'You're not going to be around to be on the front row," he said.
"I used to hold his hand as he stopped breathing, and it was not until he actually stopped breathing, and he was dead that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley kkompeta fl-Olympics 2012 u rebaħ il-bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I dreamed of my whole life -- that I should go down before a crowd of households at a Olympic Games, that there was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired his first song — Heather Small — who resoned with him in building up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
● Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Embassi Mickelson engraved on Ryder Cup Saturday
William American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but se jkollu jaġġusta l-forma tiegħu biex jevita li jkun as a milestone unhappy.
* Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, waswitched by Captain Jim Furyk for the four Saturday balls and foursomes.
* Minflok being at the centre of the action, bħalma spiss kien għall-Istati Uniti, ir-rebbieħ kbir ta’ ħames times  parted his day between being cheerleader and working on his game on the range, hoping to correct what was happening to him.
Qatt l-eqreb drivers, even at the peak of his career, aren't the 48-year-old ideal for the strictly Le Golf National course, where the long straw is usually punishable mis shots wrongfully.
U jekk it is not difficult enough, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson face the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who joined Rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
Jekk Americans, erba’ punti mill-bidu tat-12-il singles, frost into a hot start, matching of Mickelson could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much more.
"He understood bis-sħiħ the role he played today, gave me a pat on my back, and grabbed his arm around me, and said he'll be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and has been added so much to these groups in the past, and this week.
Probabbilment ma ħsibtx li hu jilgħab żewġ  matches.
I thought more, but that's how it worked, and that's the way we thought we should go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
ኣብታ Mickelson issuing the record of Nick Faldo for the most matches of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
Jista’ jkun li l-Organistan jissuġġerixxi tmiem karriera ta’ Ryder Cup li qatt ma qabblet għalkollox l-għoli tal-individwu tiegħu.
j. Mickelson għandu 18 rebħa, 20 telfa u 7 arrows, although Furyk qal li preżenzaه ġabet xi intellettwali lill-grupp.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, fantastic, he likes to be fun at people, and he's a great guy to have in the group room," he explained.
"I think the young players had fun having arriving at him, as well, this week, which was fun watching.
He provides much more than just playing."
Captain Europe Thomas Bjorn knows that a great leadership can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, il-kaptan Ewropew, jaf mill-esperiment li traduzzjoni ta’ tmexxija konsiderevoli lejn l-individwi ta’ l-aħħar jum f’The Ryder Cup can easily turn into a ride uncomfortable.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros kellu vantaġġ ta’ ħames punti fuq l-Americans, imma kien għadu kif sar il-linja ta’ terminazzjoni bl-imnieħer tagħhom quddiem l-iqsar margins, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a major lead in Valderrama; we had a leading in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this has not ended.
You go bore full tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this thornbush, and that is where the focus remains.
I said, "All the while, I'm focusing on the 12 players who are in our side, but we're quite aware of what's standing over the other side -- the greatest players in the world."
* Meta xxokked lil Bjorn, he liked how his players carried out a tough golf course, he added: “Ma kontx se nibqaʼ quddiem myself f’dan.
‫Tomorrow is a beast different.
‫Tomorrow is the individual performances that come forward, and that's a different thing to do.
It's great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when you are out there individually, then you will be tested to the fullest extent of your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you need to get across to players, is to get the best out of your life tomorrow.
Now, you leave l-ieħor behind, and he has to go and get the best of himself, as well."
Għall-kuntrarju ta’ Bjorn, numru oppost Jim Furyk se jkun qed ifittex lill-atturi tiegħu biex iwettqu aħjar b’mod individwali milli kienu sħabhom, eċċ. Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself kien fuq iż-żewġ naħat ta’ dawk il-bidliet kbar ta’ l-aħħar jum, li kienu parti mill-grupp rebbieħa ta’ Brookline qabel ma terminated a loser hekk kif Europe pulled off the “Miracles at Medinah”.
"I remember every word damned of it," he answered in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, il-kaptan fl-1999, railed players tiegħu lejn l-aħħar day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to get off to that fast starter like you saw in Brookline, like you saw in Medinah.
When that momentum gets to go one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those matches nofs.
We set up our line-up accordingly and put the guys out as we felt like, you know, we're trying to make some magic tomorrow."
Thomas ngħata l-kompitu li jipprova jmexxi l-gwerra u jiltaqa’ ma’ Rory McIlroy in the top match, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter of the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," said Bjorn of his single choices.
The new warship of Germany revoked again.
L-aktar frigate tal-German Navy ġdida kellha tiġi inkarigata fl-2014 biex tissostitwixxi vapuri tal-gwerra kiesħa tal-età, iżda mhux se jkun hemm sa mill-inqas sena d-dieħla minħabba sistemi żbaljati u cost of snowballing, l-midja lokali rrapportat.
Co-communication of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, was postponed until l-ewwel half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
Il-bastiment kellu jingħaqad mal-Baħar Navy fl-2014, imma l-kwistjonijiet ta’ disturbanza wara t-tqegħid fis-suq dawru l-destin tal-proġett ambizzjuż.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels, which the Navy ordered lura fl-2007, se jiġu sostitwiti mill-frigati ta’ Bremen-klassi ta’ age ageing.
It is understood that they will feature a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-shipn missiles as well as some teknoloġiji of theft, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other karatteristiċi importanti jinkludu فترات longer ta’ manutenzjoni - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from ports.
Madankollu, id-dewmien kontinwu ifisser li bastimenti tal-gwerra li jaqtgħu l-età -- li jgħidu li jippermettu lill-Germanja tagħmel project power overseas -- se jkunu diġà skadat mal-ħin li jidħlu fis-servizz, Die Zeit notes.
The F125 frigate, li ma ntwerietx, għamlet il-kliem tas-sena l-oħra, meta hu officially refused lill-Afganistan German Navy to commission the vessel and returned it to the Bloom & Voss Shipyard of Hamburg.
Wannan was the first time that the Navy returned vapur to builder wara l-wasla.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of “deficiencies in software and hardware” crucial, which made the ship of war useless if deployed on a war mission.
● Nuqqasijiet ta’ Software kienu partikolarment importanti, peress li vapuri tal-klassi ta’ Baden-Wuerttemberg se jkunu mħaddma minn צוות ta’ madwar 120 sailor - half of the manpower on old Bremen class frigates.
Barra minn hekk, rriżulta li l-bastiment huwa piż żejjed b’mod drammatiku li jnaqqas il-prestazzjoni tagħha u jillimita l-kapaċità tal-Navigazzjoni li żżid l-aġġornamenti futuri.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Falz" is believed to be twice as heavy as vapuri tal-klassi simili użati mill-Germans in World War II.
Apart from the faulty hardware, the price tag of the whole project — including training of the crew — is also becoming a matter.
Jingħad li laħqet EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6bn) — minn €2.2 billion ($3.6bn) fil-bidu.
Diffikultajiet li jaqtgħu l-foresti ġodda jsiru ta’ importanza b’mod partikolari fid-dawl ta’ twissijiet reċenti li l-poter navali tal-Ġermanja qed jegħreq.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, kap tal-kumitat tad-defiċit tal-Parliamentar German, اعترف li l-Afrika Navy is actually "mill-bastimenti li jistgħu jinbiegħu."
* Il-uffiċjal qal li l-kwistjoni niżlet maż-żmien, minħabba li bastimenti antiki ġew deportati, iżda ma ngħatawx vessels ta’ sostituzzjoni.
Hu lmented li l-ebda wieħed mill-frigati tal-klassi Baden-Wuerttemberg ma seta’ jassoċja mal-Baħar Navy.
Hellows National Trust Hearings for the Secret Life of Bats' Secret Life of Cathedes
● Research ġdid li qed isir at a estate in the Scottish Highlands aims at revealing how bats use the landscape in their hunting for food.
Hopefully, dawn il-konklużjonijiet se يضيء الضوء ġdid على سلوك الثدييات المطيرة الفريدة ويساعد على توجيه attivitajiet ta’ konservazzjoni futuri.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common pipistrelles, soprano pipistrelles, as well as brown-looking bats and Daubenton in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders se jitqiegħdu f’postijiet ewlenin madwar il-proprjetà biex isegwu attivitajiet ta’ batt throughout the season.
Ufficial NHS staff and voluntiera se jwettqu wkoll esperimenti mobbli permezz ta’ detectors li jaħdmu bl-idejn.
An expert analiżi sounds of all the recordings will ascertain frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what.
* Imbagħad, se jiġi prodott map and report habitat to create stampa dettaljata tal-imġiba tagħhom fuq skala ta’ landscape.
J. Rob Dewar, Consultant for the Conservation of Nature for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal liema areas of housing are the most important for the batteries and how each species uses them.
Din l-informazzjoni se tgħin biex jiġi ddeterminat il-benefiċċji ta’ xogħol ta’ ġestjoni tal- habitat, bħall-ħolqien meadows, kif ukoll ta’ kif it is best to maintain forestlands for batteries and other species associated with it.
● Popular bats in Scotland and all over the U.S. have declined considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from the construction and development of work that affects l - osteoporożi u l - osteoporożi.
It-turbines tan-nar u t-tidwil jistgħu wkoll joħolqu riskju, kif ukoll طائرات flypapers and some chemical treatments of materials of construction, kif ukoll attakki minn qtates tal-pets.
Undoubtedly, bats are not blind.
However, owing to their novel hunting habits, widnejhom huma iktar ta’ benefiċċju minn għajnejhom meta comes to catch prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 buildings historically, 38 ገነት importanti, 76,000 ettaru ta’ art madwar il-pajjiż, take lottery seriously.
Fiha għaxar esperti mħarrġin, li regolarment jagħmlu esibizzjonijiet, spezzjonijiet roots, u sometimes ta’ salvataġġ.
Saħansitra l-organizzazzjoni stabbiliet l-ewwel u ddedikat battalji ta’ Scotland f’Treave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten bat species of Scotland.
Home manager David Thompson, David Thompson, says that the property is the best territory for them.
He said, "Here at the threat we have a great area for batteries," he said.
"Għandna l-bini antik, lots of trees Veterans and all the good habitat.
ولكن hemm الكثير about batteries that are still unknown, so work that we do here and other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to prosper."
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance within property, since it is possible to destroy unknowingly a single mother grenade that could kill up to 400 females and young people, possibly destroying a whole population.
● Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb, or to destroy lanterns.
● Elisabeth Ferrell, uffiċjal Scottish for the Bat Conservation Trust, ħeġġeġ lill-pubbliku biex jippromwovi l-għajnuna.
قالت: "We still have a lot to learn about our batteries and many of the species we just don't know how populations of them are doing."
j. Ronaldo dismiss allegations of rape as lawyers set up to sue magazine German.
Cristiano Ronaldo kkundannat l - rape bħala “aħbarijiet foloz”, saying that people“ want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are set up to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
● Il-Portugall u Juventus forward ġew akkużati li jrażżnu mara Amerikana, jisimha Kathryn Mayorga, f’kamra tal-lukanda ta’ Las Vegas fl-2009.
He's allegedly paid then $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported يوم الجمعة.
* Speaking in a video of Instagram Live to his 142 million follow-up 142 million hours wara li ġew irrapportati l-istqarrijiet, Ronaldo, 33, slammed the reports as "good news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, l-aħbarijiet foloz," the five-time rebbieħ Ballon d'Or says fil-kamera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it is part of the job.
I'm a happy man and good man,' add player, smile.
The lawyers of Ronaldo are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations, which they called "to report inadmissible suspetti in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek تعويضs “for damage morali b’ammont li jikkorrispondi mal- gravità tal-vjolenza, probabbilment wieħed mill-aktar الانتهاكات serji tad-drittijiet personali f’dawn l-aħħar snin”.
tilastana li l-allegat inċident seħħ f’Ġunju 2009 f’site at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly marru lura to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped her arbitrarily, according to papers filted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
He claims Mayorga that Ronaldo fell down to his knees after the allegation of the incident and told her that he was "99%" a "good guy" cut by the "one percent".
Id-dokumenti jsostnu li Ronaldo ikkonfermat li l-irġiel kellhom sess, iżda li kien konxju.
Um, Mayorga tgerger ukoll li hi marret il-pulizija u li ħadet ritratti ta’ l-uġigħ tagħha f’مستشفى, iżda li iktar tard qabel ma qablet għal تسوية barra mill-qorti minħabba li ħassitha “twerwret ta’ vendetta” u kienet tinkwieta dwar“li tkun degraded publicly”.
● Hi, li għandha 34 sena, tgħid li issa qed tfittex biex tegħleb il-ftehim hekk kif l-inċident allegat għadu qed iweġġgħuha.
}Ronaldo was on the edge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the allegation of the attack, and this summer moved to the Italian giants Juve in a deal of €100 million.
He Brexit: UK 'madagaspa would ever regret' the loss of carmakers.
The UK “will regret it forever” if it has lost its status as a world leader in the manufacture of cars after Brexit, Secretary of Business Greg Clark, qal.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Brittanja left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said li l-impatt tad-dewmien fil-fruntieri f’każ ta’ Brexit, li ma jkunx hemm tmiem, jista’ jħallas l-impjiegi.
The Burnaston plant -- li jagħmel Toyota’s Auris and Avensis -- prodott kważi 150,000 cars li minnhom 90% ġew esportati għall-bqija tal-Unjoni Ewropea last year.
"I think it's that, if Britannja tasal out of the EU at the end of March, we'll see stops in the production factory," said Marvin Cooke, direttur ta' Toyota ta' Burnaston.
Other manifatturi tal-karozzi tar-Renju Unit qajjem biża's li jitilqu mill-UE mingħajr ftehim dwar kif il-kummerċ transkonfinali se jaħdem, inkluż Honda, BMW u Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says, “it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what makers of cars say is the risks of a chain of supply in case of a Brexit without end.
● Il-linja tal-produzzjoni ta’ Toyota hija mmexxija fuq il-bażi ta’ “just-time”, b’partijiet li jaslu kull 37 minuta mill-fornituri tar-Renju Unit u tal-UE għall-karozzi li jridu jiġu ordnati.
Jekk ir-Renju Unit telaq mill-UE mingħajr ftehim fid-29 ta’ Marzu, jista’ jkun hemm disturb fil-fruntiera li تقول li l-industrija tista’ twassal għal dewmien u nuqqas ta’ partijiet.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a value of inventory a day at its Derbyshire plant, and the company said, and thus the production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa’s Chequers Plan for Future Relations with the EU's EU's Plan is "mhux predetermined to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not just the success that is to be enjoyed right now but that we should take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 of Today's Programme.
"The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to be absolutely able to continue what has been a set of chains of supply that have been very successful."
* Toyota ma setax jgħid kemm iddum il-produzzjoni biex titwaqqaf, but fuq medda twila ta’ żmien, wissa li l-ispejjeż miżjuda se jnaqqsu l-kompetittività tal-impjant u eventwalment iħallsu l-impjiegi.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the convent for the Unity Union at the plant, said: "By experience, once these jobs go, they never come back.
Helen spokesman tal-gvern qal: "Since we have put forth a detailed and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
* Il-laqgħa Trummp with Rosenstein tista’ terġa’ tittardja, says White House.
The Donald Trump’s high-stage meeting with the Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein could be "returned to another week" as the fight against the highest court appointer Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
● Rosenstein supervises the work of special advice Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference fl-elezzjonijiet Russu, rabtiet bejn Trump aides u Russia, u improbabbli ta’ ostaklu ta’ ġustizzja mill-President.
Kemm jekk Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney-General, thereby endangering the independence of Mueller, he has fueled gossip of Washington for months.
Early this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the President through the 25th amendment.
* Rosenstein ċaħad ir-rapport.
But l-Awwissu last Monday, hu went to the White House, owing to reports he was about to resign.
Minflok, a meeting مع Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced għall-Ħamis.
● Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a konflict with the Judicial Committee of the Senate, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
يوم الجمعة, Trump ordna li FBI should have been investigative for a week of claims against Kavanaugh, u li jkompli jtardja votazzjoni sħiħa tas-Senate.
Sarah Sanders, secretary of the press of Trump, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
* When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for which it has not been set, it may be this week, I could see that pushing back a week, given all the other things that are happening with the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I always like to keep press up-to-date."
Xi rapporteurs would contest the assertion: Sanders have not held press briefings since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Said Sanders: “The scarcity of briefings is not due to a dissagage for reporters on TV, although she said: “I will not disagree with the fact that they are grandma.”
Imbagħad, she suggested that contact dirett between Trump and the press would increase.
"Il-President jagħmel iktar korsijiet Q&A than any president li qabel kien," she said, and added mingħajr ma quoted evidenza: "We've looked at those numbers."
.. Briefings will still occur, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask President of the United States questions directly, it's infinitely better than to talk to me.
We're trying to do that much, and you've seen us do it a lot over the last few weeks, and that'll take place in the place of a press briefing when you can talk to President of the United States."
● Trump regularly takes questions when she leaves White House or when she participates in open sessions or press conferences with administrators who visit her.
Normally, conferences presses in Solo are rare.
Forsi dan il-ġimgħa, f’New York, il-President wera għala, kultant, yin frisk u dehra mbassra qabel ġurnalists miġbura.

Jack Ross: ‘The final ambition of me is to manage Scotland’
● President Sunderland, Jack Ross, jgħid li “ambition inspired out” is to become manager of Scotland at some stage.
The Scott, 42, is relishing the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who currently sits in third place in League One, three punti off top.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after St. Mirren ignited back to the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
Got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Sportsson of Scotland.
"But trabbejt in view of Scotland in Hampden a lot with my dad as a child, and it always drew me back.
Madankollu, dik l-opportunità ma tiġix biss, jekk nirnexxu f’ġestjoni tal-klabbs."
Fosthom hemm Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former president of Alloa Athletic Athletics jgħid li ma ħass l-ebda rabja f’li jsegwi dawn l-ismijiet stabbiliti f’din il-klabb, peress li qabel kien ċaħad superstizzjonijiet minn Barnsley u Ipswich Town.
"Should I be successful at this moment by ‘Can I return this club to the Premier League?’"
Because of the structure and facilities in this club, it certainly belongs to the Premier League, ” he said.
"It's not a task easy to get it there, but probabbilment insib lili nnifsi biss bħala li qed nagħmel suċċess here if I can get the club back there."
Ross huwa biss 3 years fil-karriera ta’ l-immaniġġjar tiegħu, wara perijodu bħala assistant boss f’Dumbarton u fans ta’ 15-il xahar fuq il-persunal ta’ kopji tal-qalb.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to third grade, and transformed St. Mirren from the back of relegation to winners of the title Championship in the following season.
And Ross says that he is more comfortable now than qatt qabel matul il-karriera tiegħu fil-karriera playing Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Miren and Hamilton Academic.
“ Probabbilment it was a real crossroads”, he recalled, of taking charge of Alloa.
"I truly believed li l-immaniġġjar huwa l-aħjar għalija, aktar milli لعب.
* It sounds studious because I did okay, kicked out of it a reasonable lifestyle, and enjoyed some elevations reasonable.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you need to pass through on a weekly basis.
I still go through that in terms of the stresses and pressures of the job, but the management just feels right.
Dejjem ridt li nikkontrolla, u issa qed nagħmel it, it feels more comforting than I have been in my skin throughout my adult life."

Chest pump advertising the مقارنة mother to cows divides the opinion online.
Kumpanija tal-pompa tas-sider qassamet opinjoni online ma’ fuljett li jqabbel lill-ommijiet li qed ireddgħu mal-bhejjem li qed jintlibsu.
● To mark the launch of what is said to be “the first silent breast bump of the world,” the consumer's company of technology technology Elvie released a video-in-cheeked music inspired by the tongue to show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers expressing it.
Erba’ ommijiet reali jila’s dancing in a barn filled with hay of cattle to a track that includes poetics such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you hadn't noticed these are not mudders, they're my boobs."
The chorus continues: "Put it out, pump it out, I feed them babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my daughters."
However, the advertising, published on the Facebook page of the firm, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 opinions and hundreds of comments, il-video rċieva reazzjonijiet konfużi mill-osservaturi, ħafna jgħidu li huma lighting the “horors” of the dairy industry.
"A very poor decision on the use of baqars to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and to give birth in order to produce milk, unless aborts of them are stolen within days of birth," wrote one.
Il-pompa tas-sider ta’ Elvie fittxeha b’mod għaqli ġewwa bra li tredda’s (Elvie/Mama)
Another kkummentat: “Not surprisingly tragedies both for the mother and for the baby.
But why not use them to advertise pump of the breast for mothers who get to keep their babies?"
Elsewhere someone else added: "Such a non-text for touch."
And others defended the advertising, while one woman admitted that she found the song “Himmy”.
"I think this is idea genus.
Had I had one had I been breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advertising is a bit mad but I took it for what it was.
This is a genius product," wrote one.
Said another: "This is a fun advertising aimed at mothers who pump (madagably at their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not a gigantic praise or judgment of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they were all dancing with the discreet pumps that were locked in their bras.
Il-kunċett wara l-kampanja huwa bbażat on the understanding that many women with breast-pumps say they feel like cattle.
The Elvie Pump, however, is silenced completely, has no wire or tubes and fits discreetly into a breastplate, gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping.
● Ana Balarin, partner u ECD at Mother commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a product rivoluzzjonary that it deserved a start bold and provocative.
By drawing parallel bejn women expressing their expressions and baqars of milk, we wanted to put  breast pumping and all its challenges in the light spotlight, filwaqt li we show in a way that is entertaining and relaxable the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump made the titles.

● Hundreds of immigrant Children Moving Quietly to Camp Tent on the Texas Border Texas
* L-għadd ta’ tfal migranti miżmuma fl-isnowdown, minkejja li l-qsim tal-fruntieri kull xahar baqa’ relattivament mhux mibdul, partikularment minħabba li l-politika u r-rekords iebsa introdotti mill-amministrazzjoni Trump made it more difficult to place children with sponsors.
● Traditionally, most sponsors have been migrants mingħajr dokumenti themselves, and have feared the danger of risking their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.
Il-periklu żdied f’Ġunju, meta l-awtoritajiet federali bassru li sponsori potenzjali u שאר membri adulti tal-familja tagħhom kellhom bżonn jippreżentaw fingerprints, u li d-dejta kienet se tinqasam mal-awtoritajiet tal-immigrazzjoni.
Ġimgħa שעבר, Matthew Albence, senior uffiċjali with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, شهد before the Congress li l-Aġenzija arrestet dozens of people who applied for sponsoring minors who did not associate with them.
U.S.A. confirmed li iktar tard 70% من dawk li ġew arrestati ma kellhomx rekords kriminali ta’ qabel.
"Closing up to 80% of the individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are here illegally in the country, and a lot of them are aliens kriminali.
So we continue to pursue those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
● Wanting to process the children more quickly, officials introduced regoli ġodda, which would require some of them to appear in court within xahar of their arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the shelter workers.

Syria tells us, French and Turkish 'forzi occupants' to withdraw immediately.
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs Wald al-Moualem also called upon the Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country’s war is now in its eighth year.
Um, Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that the forces barranin were illegally on the Syrian soil, under the pretext to fight terrorism, and “will be dealt with accordingly”.
He said to the assembly, "They must withdraw immediately and without conditions."
● Moualem insisted that “wara dwar terror kważi overroat” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, with millions more being devastated from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to “take up this battle holy until we purge all the territories of Syria” both of the groups of terror and of“ every foreign presence illegally”.

On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good for them to return, and he blamed "بعض Western countries" for “expanding fears unreasonable” that prompted the refugees to stay away.
"We called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a matter of humanity purely."
U.S.A. u l-Unjoni Ewropea wissew li s’issa ma jkunx hemm għajnuna għar-ristrutturar għas-Sirja sakemm ikun hemm ftehim politiku bejn Assad u l-oppożizzjoni biex tintemm il-gwerra.
diplomatics tan-NU jgħidu li ftehim reċenti bejn ir-Russja u t-Turkija li jistabbilixxi żona buffera fl-aħħar stronghold ribelluż ta’ Idlib ħoloq opportunità biex jimxu ’ l quddiem ma’ diskussjonijiet politiċi.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented attakk واسع النطاق mill-forzi Sirjani li appoġġawhom Russi fuq il-provinċja, fejn jgħixu tliet miljun ruħ.
However, Moualem enfasizzat li l-ftehim kellu “iskadenzi ċari” u expressed أمل li a military action would target johadists, including fighters from the Front Nusra connected with Al-Qaida, who “will be eradicated”.
..مبعوث United Nations Staffan de Mistura نأمل أن يعقد قريبا اول laqgħat ta’ committee ġdid magħmul minn gvernijiet u rappreżentanti tal-oppożizzjoni biex jiftħu دستور wara l-gwerra għas-Sirja u يطهِّر الطريق għall-elezzjonijiet.
● Moualem laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be restricted "to review articles of the current Constitution", and warned against interference.
Għaliex Trump Will Win a Second Termination
By that logic, Mr. Trump would rebaħ re-election in 2020 unless, as many viewers liberali probabbilment tama, impunity and scandal would end prematurely prematurely prematurely prematurely.

Haddii the Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that body, just as he prepares to go again before the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of peers.

Prosekuturi Federali li jfittxu penal death rarely for the NYC terrorist attack suspected
Il-prosekuturi Federali fi New York qed ifittxu l-piena tal-mewt għal Sayfullo Saipov, l-suspettat fl-attakk tat-terroriżmu tal-Belt ta’ New York li qatel tmien persuni -- kastig rari li ma sarx fl-Istat għall-kriminalità federali mill-1953.
Saipov, li għandu 30 sena, allegedly użat a home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a motorcycle along the Westside Highway in the Lower Manhattan, towing pedestrians and ciclists down his way on Oct.
Biex tiġi ġġustifikata sentencing to death, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intimattivaly” killed eight victims and “sintensivaly” caused serious physical harm, according to the notice of the intention to seek the death penalty, fil-Grigal of New York.
According to the court document, both of those counts carry out a possibbilment sentence of death.
Ġimgħat wara l-attakk, Seypov, grand jury federali, qabeż lil Saipov b’akkuża ta’ 22 skont, li kienet tinkludi tmien اتهامات ta’ qtil ta’ għajnuna għal racketeering, normalment użati minn prosekuturi federali f’każijiet ta’ kriminalità organizzata, u اتهام ta’ vjolenza u qerda ta’ vetturi bil-mutur.
The attack required "ippjanar sostanzjali u premeditation" by prosecutors, describing how Saipov carried it bħala "healthy, cruel and depraved".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused il-ħsara, il-ħsara, u t-telf għall-familji u l-ħbieb ta’ Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco),” in-note statement of intention.
Ħames mill-vittmi kienu turisti mill-Argentina.
Għaddew għaxar snin מאז li l-Atlantiku tan-Northern New York prosecuta l-aħħar każ ta’ piena għall-mewt.
* L-avukat, Khalid Barnes, ġie kundannat għall-רצח ta’ żewġ fornituri tad-drogi, iżda fl-aħħar mill-aħħar ġie kundannat بالسجن f’Settembru 2009.
* L-aħħar darba li l-penali għall-mewt twettqet f’każ federali ta’ New York kien fl-1953 għal Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, koppja miżżewġa li nqatlu wara li ġew kundannati bil-konsistenza biex jagħmlu speriament għall-Unjoni Sovjetika matul il-grilja kiesħa sentejn ilu.
Both Rosenbergs were killed by the chairman eletronic on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, wera nuqqas ta’ remorse fil-jiem u l-months ta’ wara l-attakk, according to the Court’s documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked for a show of the ISIS flag in his hospital room, stated by the police.
Hu qatt ma talab lis-said 22-accused charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were “disgracelessly obviously” by decision tal-prosekutur.
"We think that the decision to seek a penalty for death rather than to accept a petition to be guilty to live in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the turmoil of these events for all involved," said Patton.
Uncle Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.

He said, "Lone thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that's going on over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry, silly, sluggish, and untrustworthy, aren't true."
"When you look at releases and leaks, then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
"I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Fininstein, did you leak?
Remember how she responded... Did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
"For I have not dragged."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't shred," he added, in effect, with the impression of the senator.
}Finstein intbagħat l-ittra li ddeskrivet l-allegations kontra Kavanaugh by Ford f’Lulju, u dan tneħħew qabel f’Settembru -- iżda Finestein denied that the leak came from office.
"لم أخف ادعاءات Dr. Ford, I didn't turn her story," Feinstein told the Committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as she asked."
Imma ċ-ċaħda tagħha ma jidhirx li qiegħda sew mal-president, who commented during the Sabbath night: “I'll tell you, what, that was really a bad language of the body.
Maybe she hasn't, but that's the worst language I've ever seen."
* Waqt li kompla jiddefendi lill-authorarju tal-Qorti Suprema, li t-tliet nisa akkużaw b’mod sexually misconduct, President suggested that the Democracts were using the allegations for their own ends.
"They are determined to take the power back by any means necessary.
You see the meaning, the stubbornness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to get power and control," the Media reported to the president, saying.

Joe, daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone to read it for the first time before the publication.
It's amusing to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington."
* Billi qalet lil missierها, li kien jaħdem bħala a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children’s book by a small toy, kien ikun bla sanction about the rejection of his work, she added the 60th anniversary of the books published was “bitersweet” after his death last year.
Of Paddington, which she describes as “a member of our family of great importance”, żiedet li missierها kien sarkantly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man, he was not a proud person," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who achieves something: you are proud of them even though it's not really your doing.
I think he saw the success of Paddington in that way.
“Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to credit Paddington himself.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as FBI starts investigation
"I thought, 'If we could actually get something like what he was asking for -- an investigation limited in time, limited in scope -- we might possibly bring a little unity', said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the Committee was "frequing" among a rigorous partisan gridlock.
Why didn’t Mr Kavanaugh and his Repubblikan supporters want the FBI to investigate?
* Raġuneዒs to their reluctance are due to timing.
L-elezzjonijiet ta’ nofs it-term huma biss 5 weeks away, f’Novembru 6 - jekk, kif mistenni, ir-Repubblikan qed jagħmlu ħażin, imbagħad سيضعفون بشدة في محاولاتهم للحصول على الرجل الذي يريدون أن ينتخبوا fl-ogħla court in the land.
George W. Bush qed jiltaqa’ mal-telefon biex jiltaqa’ mas-Senators, billi jobby them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him he met his wife Ashley, who was the secretary personali of Mr. Bush.
What happens after FBI produces its report?
Lalle se jkun hemm تصويت fis-Senate, where 51 Repubblikan u 49 demokrats bħalissa qegħdin.
Undoubtedly, għadu mhux ċar jekk Mr Kavanaugh jistax לקבל mill-inqas 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, vice-president, to break rabta u confirm it before the Supreme Court.

Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," says he is unfit to serve at the Supreme Court.
House Leader Minority Nancy Pelosi jismu Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperament unfit to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi kkummenta f’intervista f’Sibt at the Festival of Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever did so, they would say 'hysterical', "Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony of Kavanaugh before the Judicial Committee of the Senate on Thursday.
* Kavanaugh refused emotionally to deny allegations that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford attacked sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh kien emozzjonalment, sometimes almost shouted and chopped while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also ikkundanna b’mod espliċitu lil Democracts on the Committee, charging the allegations against him as a "delay of a grotesque and a harmonious character" organized by liberals irrabjati li Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi qal li she believed in testimony Kavanaugh li wera li ma setax jaqdi fil-Qorti Suprema, ladarba dan wera li hu kien stubborni kontra Democrats.
"I think he's not fit to say those statements and the way he followed the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi deteriorated when asked if she would try to implant Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this -- if he's not telling the truth to the Congress or to the FBI, then he's not fit to be in the Supreme Court just but to be in the court he's right now," said Pelosi.
Burningly, Kavanaugh is a judge in the D.C. C.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi żiedet li bħala Democract, she was concerned about the potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered to be a conservative justice.
* Fl-istqarrijiet ta’ konferma tiegħu, Kavanaugh طرح mistoqsijiet dwar jekk kienx se jegħleb ċerti deċiżjonijiet tal-Qorti Suprema.
"It's not the time for ahysteric, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, "M'huwiex that wonderful," said Pelosi.
Women also need to report it.
It’s diatribution righteous, months and years of כעס, and it’s not possible to get it out without weeping.
"We weep when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's uncommon, do you?"
Burningly, she continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive in some place, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique which meant that when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think that I am frustrating because I am crying.
I am angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought that it was wonderful."
● Teams are allowed as an outlet for fury جزئيا, given that they are basically misunderstandings.

Fl-1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on board a boat called Monkey Business and fell out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, was deeply frustrated, he figured that there was no reason why she should not explore the idea of running for President itself.
"It was not a decision to reason well," she said to me with laughing 30 years wara.
"Here already seven other candidates were in the race, and the last thing they needed was one another.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind her incurring funds, u għalhekk wegħedt li ma kinitx se tidħol fil-kampanja unless it raised 2 million.

"Do they think that I'm being cut off?" she wondered.

How the US-Chinese Trade War may be good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the war trade between the US and China were deaf, waqt li l-gwerra was far from over, a rift between the countries might be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts jgħidu.
}Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing esportazzjonijiet Ċiniżi ewlenin, inklużi panels solari, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation rolled this week with tariffs ġodda li jolqtu $200 biljun ($150 biljun) ta’ oġġetti, billi taxxat b’mod effettiv half of all the goods li jidħlu fl-Istati Uniti miċ-Ċina.
Jean Beijing retaliated darba wara l-oħra in kind, l-aktar reċenti l-iskarkar ta’ tariffi ta’ bejn 5 u 10 fil-mija fuq $60 biljun ta’ oġġetti tal-American.
China تعهدت li tqabbel l-Istati Uniti ma’ shot-for-language, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world will soon ignite.
● Returning Washington means تخطي الطلبات, but bowing publicly to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
Yet, experts say, if Beijing can play cards right, the pressures of the US to war trade can positively support China over a long term by reducing the inter-dipendenza of the two economies.
"Il-fatt li deċiżjoni politika mgħaġġla f’Washington jew Beijing tista’ toħloq kundizzjonijiet li jibdew taqlib ekonomiku f’xi pajjiż hija tabilħaqq perikoluża ħafna milli dawk li josservaw qabel," said Abigail Grace, a associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Centre for New American Security, a tank of thought.
According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, “prepared” for refugees to return, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

* Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
He said, "Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism."
The Government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All the conditions are present now for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their everyday lives and livelihood.
e. The United Nations estimates that iktar minn 5.5 miljun Syriani ħarbu mill-pajjiż mill-bidu tal-gwerra fl-2011.
Six million ruħ oħra li għadhom jgħixu f’dan il-pajjiż jeħtieġu l-għajnuna الإنسانية.

The United States star Phil Mickelson, who strolled most of the tournament, plugged his trunk into the water at the 16th hole par-3, u qabbel it with Francesco Molinari.

Normalment, “I do not cry, but illum I cannot help.
It was a difficult year.
I’m so grateful for Thomas’s choice of me and his faith in me.
I am so happy, I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the group, and I'm glad that I was able to help," said a emotional woman Garcia following the European victory.
He passes the torch to fellow countryman John Ram, who took down the Golf legend of the US Tiger Woods 2&1 in singlers playing Sunday.
"The great pride I feel, to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that guy," said Rahm, 23-year-old.
Wads tilfet all four of his matches in France, u issa għandha rekord ta’ 13-21-3 kabotik fil-karriera Ryder Cup.
A statistic strange by one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 titles prinċipali second to Jack Nicklaus.
* Team USA strolled all weekend to find the roads fair with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played golf-high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.

Kien hemm żmien this morning meta tefgħu xi heat fuq l-Ewropa.
We're cutting off.
Hatreds to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I am proud to serve as captain.
Gotta tug your cap.
We're set out on plan."
