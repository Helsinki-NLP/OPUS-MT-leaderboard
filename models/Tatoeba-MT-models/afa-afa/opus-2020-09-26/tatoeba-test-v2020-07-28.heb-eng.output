Many animals who have lived thousands of years have no longer existed.
Let's go.
Have you had a nice weekend?
Am I stupid?
She was depressed because of all her problems.
Are meals costly?
'Cause the rain's gone on a trip.
The doctor knew how to deal with such an emergency.
The temperature's down ten degrees.
I know this neighborhood.
She accepted a request for Visa.
I thought everything was over.
It's dangerous to swim at night.
It's just like fighting spirit security.
I don't care about the risk.
It's the weather forecast time.
It looks tough.
That man's dangerous.
She cooked us a wonderful meal.
He was a soldier during the war.
I'm on the sea language.
It was my first thought.
We don't blame you.
We can't live without sleep as we can't live without food.
Someone just ringed.
They knew better days.
He's alive here.
If you don't hurry, you'll never get to the village.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I'm sick of it.
Everything depends on your decision.
You're thin.
He's stuck in his mind, his hand is back in his forehead.
There's nothing too much to say.
Look, here he comes.
She was really cold.
It's on my roster list.
Be careful not to fall to the knee.
I gave it to my mom.
Stop wasting time.
I felt pretty bad.
My hobby is a reading.
I'll drink my coffee after dinner.
I don't forgive you.
They don't believe you.
That wasn't supposed to happen.
I don't want to learn tonight.
Tom thinks Mary was wrong.
I've always known that Tom was meant to be big.
Shhh down.
Can you send this letter in a quick mail?
Close it.
Tom's not responsible.
Hey, guys, I'm Tom, and I'm here with Mary.
You look beautiful tonight.
We've experienced problems of uniting with the device yesterday.
Tom visited Mary in October 20.
When I got home, I found your letter waiting for me.
They're Russians.
It's simpler than it looks.
She looks like a serious and reliable person to me.
Tom Athlete.
He tried.
We can't survive without your help.
I was the one who offered it.
This romance isn't as good as his last rum.
They stayed this way for a while.
This path is dangerous.
Can you show me the way to the library?
I stayed home all day and read books.
That's my decision.
It's okay.
I forced him to go.
Call him to come and watch the movie.
Tom was insurmountable.
Don't mind my death.
I know exactly how you feel.
I met Tom in January.
They got a joint decision about divorce.
Stop screwing me up.
Today I'm in a spirit of my own.
It doesn't happen much.
We're planning to visit Mr. Smith tomorrow.
He has a comfortable nature.
I don't want to leave this place forever.
My son is my biggest headache.
Sit down, please!
I can't drive the car, I don't have a driving license.
She invited each of us to ice cream.
She was playing the play.
Tom told me he didn't see Mary all day.
I don't like being alone on the beach.
I'm never planning anything.
You got a map?
Tom was sweaty.
Do I have to sell it?
They're calling with hand signs.
Maybe we should ask someone for help.
I'm hungry.
That's hard to read.
I've been freaking out for a week and I haven't recovered.
We started going again right after she recovered.
Is there on the shelf an English-Japanian hotel?
The gun's stuck.
We're too few now.
We have to stay on the road.
What's Tom's problem at all?
They were born a child.
Tom looks upset.
Maybe Tom's telling the truth.
For civilization, there is now a threat of nuclear war.
I often have nightmares.
The company decided to hire two new secretaries.
Please give me a pillow.
Tom almost killed both of them.
I wanted to watch this movie with you.
Come at least six.
I'm delivering your clue.
The receptacle is very intuitive.
I'll get it back right away.
Tom and Mary are also unhappy.
What group does your boyfriend have?
Just Tom, we'll stay.
Sit down, please.
Tom decided to stay back.
Shut up, please.
Do you like what you see?
Give me a second chance.
It's natural.
Don't ever write the words "Merc Lap" and "Merc Rob" in German!
It's a violent neighborhood.
Amazing what you can learn for a week.
There are animals that can feel a storm.
How can I ever forgive Tom?
This house seems abandoned.
It's the perfect place for Mariv.
The doctor's advice.
I'm jealous.
These are my friends.
She's in love with this kid.
Tom didn't finish all his homework.
How do you know about Tom?
You sound teenage.
I know you'd do the same to me.
In the ends of the years, they raise their colors and fall down.
Tom never admits mistakenly, because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
That's how I like it.
She admits she didn't meet Maria.
It's the second river along Japan.
Nobody's happy.
Finally, I don't owe anybody.
Tom was indecent.
He's married and father to two.
Could have been a failure in answer.
He blows the bike every week.
Don't turn off the computer.
From this distance you can't be noticed anymore.
She received guidance from her previous doctor and was transferred to another hospital.
I was a loser.
My best friend speaks Irish.
It's more complicated than I thought at first.
I don't know anything about him.
I just had a few beers.
The man who screws the car is Mr. Jones.
I owe it to my friends.
I stayed calm.
She likes to try new things.
I heard him sniffing.
Go to the next page.
Did you become an angel?
I hope it can happen now.
Materials will be satisfied.
Did I touch open nerve?
There are many places of convenience in big cities.
The first hit is half the battle.
I'm not sure of it, though.
I've really seen a ghost.
Did you recover from the shock?
Tell Tom I'm going on a trip.
Everything's on the head.
You know where she lives?
Tom and Mary are probably going to marry one day.
Their house was fired.
I like this picture.
Grab a nap.
Eventually, his dream came true.
I worked very hard.
Not so he died.
She didn't come up in her hand to answer the question.
The rich explosions in Vietamine C.
I'm sure Tom told you I'd be here.
This method is profitable and lacking.
He hid the fact that he invented his wife.
Shut your big mouth.
Tom told Mary about his new car.
Who made the dynamite?
You're the greatest love of my life.
Perfect experiment.
Where's your money?
Tom asked Mary to sing stronger.
Sorry, I can't stay long.
I don't know if it's upstairs.
Where's the toothbrush?
Let's get something cold to drink.
These are my books.
I want guitar like John has.
It won't bother us if you shoot outside.
The target's cleaning up the means.
Looks like you have a lot of knowledge about it.
Are you the supporters, or are you opposed to falling?
Please don't bet it.
Long Team No C.
Today I won't get e-mail from anybody.
I waited for you.
The cat made his back.
I spent the weekend with my friends.

You want to know how I did it?
I can't find the paper.
I'm learning one language.
This microscope is growing by a hundred.
He's in debt.
Tom's a squash.
Tom's not the one who left the party early.
Speaking English in Canada?
That's really impressive!
We wanted dessert.
Tom didn't get up early enough.
Hello, how can I help you?
Tom led his gun to the target.
I believe my boyfriend is making me a horn.
You better leave.
Donald Tramp suffers from Madmansia.
Please don't ask.
I'm coming to kill you.
I like the time between the Arabs.
You should go.
You ready to go out?
I know how it must sound.
Can anyone help me here?
Where's Tom thrown into the prison house?
I learned from the best.
Don't hurry to protect me.
I just know that.
Don't ignore me again.
Area in construction: helmets have to be used.
This is Tom's locker.
I'm sure I won't recommend Tom for the job.
You should try not to forget what time.
Will you go to the United States next year?
Think about your future.
As far as I am concerned, I don't trust him at all.
I don't know what to say.
It rained yesterday.
She got caught with her pants downstairs.
I know maybe you think I'm too young.
I can't help him.
It didn't go that way.
How does everyone feel?
We're supposed to be safe here.
Have you had breakfast today?
There's a bridge three miles up the river.
Tom offered Mary not to do that.
I know you think there's no hope.
Judges have made a decision.
Hard to learn Greek?
He's going to the library to read books.
They're animals in this city.
The heavens will be clear soon.
I didn't like Tom.
We're trying to learn here.
Please admire this dog puppy.
It's impossible to provide it.
Get back to your chair.
She chose a hat to fit her new dress.
I spent the last Sunday at home.
Let's not do anything that might upset Tom.
I'm missing money.
I'm going to finish reading this romance soon.
Tom doesn't seem interested in what's going on.
I don't want you to meet my daughter anymore.
You're not going out there.
Tom drinks about three gallons of water a day.
We'll never agree.
We were glad we were alive.
Some newspapers blinded the news.
Sign it, please.
That's my car.
I'd love to see it.
This pen is the best.
Heroic ads is a dangerous matter.
Tom says he doesn't want to click any more on this.
White paper.
Drinks are half a price by six.
The sky is bright almost every day.
Well, I lied.
Whatever you do, don't come up with complaints for it.
Paris is very magical to Japanese young people.
This bridge is three times as long as it is.
I tried not to eat too much.
Tom looks desperate.
They slept in the same bed.
His success depends on his efforts.
I've got quite a lot of hats.
The residents built their houses along the river.
It was impossible to pull the pocket.
Today was thrilling.
I'm on it.
Just the necessary adjustments, please.
Salt, please.
Did you decide where to eat breakfast?
I changed my theory.
She was kind enough to pick me up from home.
I ran.
Tom's an account manager.
Get your left hand.
I'm doubting his point of statement.
I think they got into some kind of problem.
This movie's boring.
Where to go and see, my main concerns were.
My longest romantic relationship lasts four months.
She never told me yet.
Tom's an old hat that he's always wearing in the rain.
