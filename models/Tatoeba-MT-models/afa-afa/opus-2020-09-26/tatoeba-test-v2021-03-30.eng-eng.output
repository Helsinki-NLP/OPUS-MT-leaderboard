She's not a good cooker.
Tom said he's not in a hurry.
I know that Tom doesn't know anyone who does that.
I didn't know you weren't Canadians.
Come watch us play music sometime.
Tom said he understands why Mary doesn't want to do that.
Tom said that Mary was too busy to help you do that today.
Tom told me he would complain about that.
Tom's a member of my co-op housing.
Tom drove down the street that Mary lives on, hoping to see her.
I'm sure it wasn't hard to do that.
You know as well as I do that there's no chance Tom will do that.
Tom wasn't sure if he should kiss Mary or not, so he didn't.
I know that Tom might need to do this by himself.
Tom doesn't seem to be doing what he's supposed to do.
It would've been tiring to do that.
Tom must have told us the truth.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
We will have to do something.
When do you plan to do that?
Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned to do that this week.
Tom knew he would be punished.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone do that before.
That's not difficult.
I'm afraid we don't have any left.
Tom told me I should learn how to play the drums.
We have not yet succeeded.
I've never been to Paris.
Tom said he didn't eat anything, but that wasn't true.
I'm an atheist.
Tom said Mary was at home in a cold bed.
I wonder if Tom really thought it was a good idea to do that.

Tom told me he thought Mary was puzzled.
Tom said he would be happy to do that for you.
Tom said I looked a bit pale.
Tom told Mary that she should stop pretending to be confused.
Tom thought Mary was alone.
I know Tom's hiding something from me.
Did you know that Tom didn't start playing the guitar until he was thirty years old?
I wonder if Tom knows that Mary wants to do this.
I'm sure Tom will be back.
I don't think that Tom knows where Mary went on October 20th.
I know that Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
Why are everyone staring at us?
I know that Tom didn't know who did that to Mary.
I think Tom did that because everyone else in his family did.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary didn't know how to play the oboe.
I would like to use this opportunity to thank you.
I would have left early if I could have.
I know I have to do that before Tom gets here.
I don't think you'd enjoy doing that.
Tom hasn't talked to Mary about that yet.
I don't think Tom is handsome.
Tom was the only one who was sleeping.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
I should never have let you go home alone last night.
I think I'm gonna have the chance to do that tomorrow's day.
Tom said you were really good at Teens.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was autistic.
Tom would have wanted to go to Boston with you.
I know that Tom is much more creative than Mary is.
I know that Tom is a lot more creative than I am.

I think you'd all agree that Tom is one of our best singers.
Tom said he's desperate.
Tom said I don't have to do that this afternoon.
Tom said it was a good time to leave.
I know Tom's scared.
You can't appreciate the poem until you read it many times.
I deliberately did that.
Tom should never have left early.
She's already married.
This is blasphemy!
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't awake.
Tom said he was glad he was able to do that.
You can't buy one of those for less than $30.
Do you think Tom would like to go to Australia with us?
Tom said he liked dancing with Mary.
I know that Tom doesn't know why Mary couldn't do that.
Tom must have seen us do that.
I doubt Tom will run for a president.
Tom should have done this yesterday.
Tom may be angry.
Tom said Mary won't be mad.
I knew Tom wanted us to do that for him.
Tom said he didn't live in Australia anymore.
I know that Tom knew he didn't need to do that.
I hope I haven't forgotten anyone.

I suspect Tom and Mary are bored.
Tom has already been told about the problem.
I know Tom was disobedient.
I don't know anyone who hates Tom.

It's not for startners.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were depressed.

Tom has a lot of friends here.
Tom knows he's cheated.
I think Tom used to be a member of our club.
Where is your notebook?
I don't think I'll be as early tomorrow as I was today.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong.
How many kilometers is it from here to the railway station?
I don't think that story is true.
He often adopts the behaviours and speech patterns that characterize the advantages.
Tom said you were his friend.
I'm thinking of having dinner at six.
Tom told Mary he'd be doing that tomorrow.
I know Tom is over.
Tom said Mary's dog bit him.
Tom said he was through doing that.
Tom said he appealed his suspension.
He is deeply attached to her.
I thought you'd show me how to do that.
I'm telling you we have to assume Tom is dead.
Mary's got a hairdresser's appointment.
Tom said Mary thought that she might be allowed to do so today.
If you don't want to come, you don't have to.
It smells like someone was smoking a cigar in here.
We're just in time for the last train.
I think that question is not appropriate.
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a child?
I don't think anyone noticed what we were doing.
What are we going to do?
I could have cried.
There's no free lunch.
I thought you said we weren't going to Boston with Tom.
Tom is quit smoking.
I think I know what Tom is doing here.
Tom and Mary said they would be happy to help.
I'm fairly sure now that's not gonna happen.

Tom told me he wasn't sleepy.
Tom thought Mary was listening, but she wasn't.
I thought you said Tom was a barber.
I wonder if this really works.

Have you given the key to Tom?
Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him she had to do that.
My father is a doctor.
I don't think I would like to be married to Tom.

Tom often does this by himself.
I learned a lot from this conversation.
I thought Tom would buy that car.
Tom and Mary said they're very busy right now.
Tom said he was planning to stay at home all day long.
Tom should have apologized to Mary.

I know Tom doesn't know that Mary needs to do that.
Everyone here except Tom and Mary have done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was satisfied.
Tom said he was going to help us do that.
Tom's house is very close to my house.
The host cut the turkey for the guests.
I know that Tom doesn't know that he really doesn't have to do that.
I think Tom will be able to understand that.
I haven't decided yet.
I know that's not worth it.
Tom told me he thought Mary was rude.
It's not wrong.
Tom and Mary told me they felt hurt.
I'm very grateful to you.

What are you trying to do?
We didn't know if Tom and Mary were busy or not.
Tom and Mary said they planned to go.
You better take your shoes off.
I didn't think we did anything wrong.
Everyone knew Tom didn't want to do that.

Tom and Mary live in Boston with their father.
I know Tom's missing.
I would like to do that.
It won't be so hard to do that.
Don't let Tom do this by himself.
I was so excited!
Tom is a party animal.
I thought it might be fun, so I went to Tom's party.
Tom will probably need to do so today.
I hope I don't need to do that.
Tom must have changed a lot.
No one's better at this than me.
As soon as I saw Tom, I could tell that he was angry.
I know that Tom knows he shouldn't do that here.
He's here.

Tom said he would be 13 next month.
I wish I was by your side!
Get your poos off me.
I'm afraid I have to refuse.
I know you recently retired.
I knew Tom would be happy if you did that.
I wonder if we'll really do that today.
Tom's sleeping.
You're a good boy.
I should have just walked right in.
I don't think you were listening to me.
We are brothers and sisters.
I don't think Tom's finished doing that.
I don't think we did anything illegal.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try it before.
Don't you have a TV?
Don't give up!
I don't play the mandolin as well as you.
Tom said that he thought Mary might not be required to do so anymore.
I don't know why you can't admit that you need me.
The feeling is mutual.

Tom told me he thought Mary was hurt.
Tom said Mary knew he might not have had to do this by himself.
It's not very likely to rain tomorrow.
I didn't know you weren't planning on doing that next winter.
I don't know what that means.
I think it is more important to discuss possible solutions.
I didn't realize both Tom and Mary should do that.
Do Tom and Mary both snore?
It's the way it's past the time Tom promised he'd be here.
We're not going on vacation.

Who told you that we needed to do that?
Tom said Mary did that only once.

What is cooking in the kitchen?
I'm grateful for your help.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was interested in doing so.

There is no question about it.
No one can solve the problem.

I think Tom's gonna do that, too.
I shouldn't have allowed you to do that.
I've already met everyone.

Tom said he wanted to help us.
There's someone waiting for you.
They said they were ready.

I just want you to consider the possibility that you're wrong.
I'm sure I didn't say that.
Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that next time he travels.
I am as happy as I can be.
If they knew what was about to happen, they would have changed their plans.
I know that Tom didn't know that he didn't want to do that.
Tom is rich, but he's not as rich as Mary.

We split the rocket three ways.
I don't think Tom could do that by himself.
Tom told me I was pretty.
What time does the show start?
Tom knows he has to help Mary tomorrow.

I don't think Tom knows who did that to Mary.
All three of my brothers are older than I.
Tom said he didn't know if he was able to do that.
I know Tom couldn't do that.
Keep left in the next traffic lights.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for.
I think Tom loves Mary.
Tom doesn't need Mary's help.
Tom and Mary say they're lonely.
Were you afraid for the first time you were on an airplane?
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise.
I don't think Tom is the one who needs to apologize.
I am disappointed in my son.
I don't think I did very well.
Do you think there's a chance you'll do that tomorrow?
You know I don't have a car.
There is a large supermarket.
I suspected Tom was discouraged.
I'm sure Tom won't force anyone to do that.
Tom said that he knew that Mary might not be allowed to do so.
I would have done the same thing tom.
Are you sure no one can see us?
There's no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom will be busy tomorrow.
I suspected Tom might not have enough money to buy everything he wanted.
Was he touching you?
Tom and Mary said they'd be doing that soon.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
Today's the 20th October.
Tom and Mary said they planned to go.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think that Tom knows Mary isn't Canadian.
Africa is not a country.
Tom wasn't the one who told me he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that.
I don't have children.
I know Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I think that book isn't so interesting.
I was told that that's not a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team is gonna continue to get better.
I wish someone would help me with that.
Tom certainly knows that he shouldn't be doing that.
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It is a great responsibility.
I think you should turn yourselves in.
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing that.
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should have known that I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know you and Tom worked together.
No one will know I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said he thought I needed to get more exercise.
Tom told me he'd try to do that.
Tom and Mary know they shouldn't do that.
Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that next time he travels.
I knew that Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary that she shouldn't do that.
Tom said he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they weren't coming back.
Tom doesn't know that Mary is in love with someone else.
I don't think Tom is concerned.
I wish I had the chance to learn French in high school.
It was clear that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I knew Tom would be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in prison.
Tom said that Mary thought he might not have had to do this by himself.
Tom said he probably wouldn't win.
It's possible Tom may not know that I'm here.
Do you think I'm weird?
Tom thinks he knows it all.
Tom said it's not gonna end well.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't do that today.
I thought we had something to give to Tom.
The students did the work themselves.
Tom and Mary said they didn't mind doing that.
You'll stay here until you're invited.
My daughter is being trained toilet.
Tom said he didn't think that Mary could have done that.
Tom and Mary told me they were feeling good.
They said they're not ready to go.
Something happened to him.
No one suspected anything like that.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
Tom and Mary told me they never met you.
I think Tom is a pretty good painter.
I know that Tom is a picky eater and rarely tries anything new.
Tom says he didn't do anything illegal.
I suspect that Tom knows that Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know that Tom knows I know how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
She's still talking away.
You're a nerd.
Everyone was late except me.
He could not resist the temptation.
Tom will probably get angry if you do.
I assumed Tom would agree to do so.
I'm a liberal.
May I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom could help us.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that today.
I don't think Tom will have to do that alone.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
My hearing is not as good as it used to be.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admitted that he was rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should have let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now either in Australia or in New Zealand.
I didn't think we should be talking about that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
I know Tom is a little older than Mary is.
Tom didn't know anyone had been hired to kill him.
Tom told me he can't eat peanuts.
I don't think Tom would enjoy doing that.
Tom said he thought I might not have to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me that he thought he might be able to do that.
Tom said he suspected Mary was very eager to do that.
Am I the only one who is confused?
I know Tom is a bully.
He's a smartest boy.
How's your dad?
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom doesn't become jealous.
I'm pretty sure it wasn't what Tom meant.
It won't be difficult for us to do that.
Tom said Mary didn't look tired to him.
I doubt that Tom will ever be allowed to do so.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning on going anymore.
I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it looks like.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he had never planned to live in Australia for so long.
Tom told me he really didn't want to go to Boston.
Tom has a lot more books than you do.
I know Tom is about the same height as you are.
There is no excuse for his delay.
Tom must have been the one who put the drugs in my bag.
Tom said he's glad that Mary wasn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she had read the book that he would have lent her.
I wake up at seven o'clock.
I could have done that, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't told anyone they're getting married yet.
They said they planned to go Monday.
It's not gonna be easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't speak so fast, please.
They told me they had bacons and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn't tell anyone that they had to do this.
I think Tom paid too much for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all worn out.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was busy.
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary should do that.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was finished.
I thought you had to work.
Tom said he didn't have everything he needed.
You should have stayed where you were.
I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they were trying to lose weight.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was optimistic.
Tom says he can wait, but Mary can't.
Tom could've kicked himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew I was the only one who could do that, didn't you?
Tom said he didn't think he could do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary isn't awake.
Did anyone else hug Tom?
Tom told me he liked my idea.
I know you're just doing that to make me mad.
That's a mistake.
One way is not better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anyone afraid?
Tom thinks he can do anything he sets his mind to.
We got married seven years ago.
I could have done that better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't be angry with me!
I don't think Tom could have done that any better.
I know Tom didn't do that correctly.
She is in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary is better in French than she really is.
Tonight I'm free.
Do you think Tom would have done that?
That's his house.
I'm at home.
You don't need to pay for your lunch.
Maybe I should have tried harder.
I thought Tom was going to do that today.
They promised they'd check it out.
I'm sure Tom would have agreed.
Tom and Mary said they don't like to do that.
Tom said that he knew that he might have to do this by himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the final goal, but the process of getting there that matters.
Tom must have put up a fight.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance Tom might get hurt.
Tom said he was glad you did that.
I always knew Tom was a troublemaker.
Well I never!
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to win.
I'm a student, but he's not.
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary was planning to do.
I wonder if Tom is really homeick.
Tom and Mary said they can't sing very well.
Tom said he thought Mary was good in French.
Tom says he'll always love Mary.
I wish I could speak French as fluently as you do.
I wish I was someone else.
I thought Tom had already done his homework.
Tom's not busy.
I just wanted you to know I'm supporting you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We are all in grave danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks?
I just had a hard-boiled egg for myself.
Do you have a pen with you?
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next summer.
Tom and Mary probably won't be able to buy everything they need for $300.
They said they like this year's time.
Tom wants Mary to know that she can trust him.
They say they refused that deal.
I know that Tom didn't know that you couldn't do that.
I think I'll stay in Australia for a few more weeks.
With his last breath, he told him that he had been adopted.
I know that Tom is a really close friend of Mary's.
I know Tom didn't know who was supposed to do that.
Tom thinks that we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wouldn't do that?
I know that Tom would probably agree to do that.
Tom shut his computer.
I don't think Tom knows what time is.
It's obvious Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom and Mary say they don't believe John really plans to do that.
Tom could've asked me first.
You're not actually suggesting I'm going out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should have.
I don't think Tom is bossy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn't do that.
I would have done that by myself if Tom wouldn't have helped me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plans.
How do you tell anyone that?
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me he thought Mary had done that.
Tom and Mary swore they would never hit me again.
Tom said he should have stayed in Australia longer.
Tom said he knew they might not let him do that at school.
I know I can do this.
I don't think I should have left before Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't help Mary anymore.
That guy there reminds me of someone I used to know.
Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I've already told Tom I need to do that.
I plan to stay home all day Monday.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom is the only person who could have stolen Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
No one contradicted Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom is amused by what's going on?
We have not yet started fighting.
Who's knocking on the door?
I think Tom is the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They said they were supportive.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you said shocked everyone.
Tom and Mary told me they were ambidextrous.
Tom said that he thought what Mary had done was wrong.
I hope no one comes.
I thought everyone could do that.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said that he thought Mary was in her bedroom to study.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone.
Everything's gonna be OK.
Tom told me it didn't matter.
I know Tom wanted Mary to do that.
I'm twelve.
I'd forget about that.
Tom told everyone that he was through to do that.
They figured there was no hope.
Tom said Mary didn't want to do that again.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were happy.
I thought you said you were glad you didn't do that.
Tom can speak French a little.
I know that Tom is a lot longer than I am.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I can't guarantee that that's going to happen.
I knew Tom wasn't very busy.
I don't think I've ever seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom is faster at doing that than Mary.
Tom said that he thought Mary might not be required to do so again.
You're not worried about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me do that.
I told you I don't know if Tom would tell the truth or not.
Everyone's having a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said he did.
Tom and Mary both wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use someone's toothbrush.
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John loves Alice.
I wonder if Tom will be able to do that.
Tom thought it was difficult.
We walked around the lake.
I don't think it's gonna be difficult to convince Tom.
They said they didn't work on Mondays.
I don't think Tom is as rich as most people think he is.
You will not do anything like that.
You're so hot!
Tom would have been thirty years old today if he hadn't passed last year.
They said they were very mad.
I know that Tom knows that I want to do that.
I wonder if Tom is safe.
I know that Tom didn't know that he shouldn't be doing that here.
Does Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.
Tom said he felt like doing that.
I don't understand how this could have happened.
You're as tall as my sister.
Tom has read a lot of books about that.
I think Tom has already done enough.
Do you know anyone in Boston?
Tom said he thought he was the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Tom admitted that he was the one who stole Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told to do so.
We better tell the others.
Why is everyone talking about Tom?
Federer held in love at 2-2.
Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask of them.
I know that Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing that himself.
Tom said he was hoping that he and Mary could sing together.
I said nothing, and that made him angry.
When will he be finished?
You're a very ugly boy.
Tom plans to do that in the near future.
We're late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A plate of plumbing with some kebbs is heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning to do that.
Tom said he was wondering whether Mary could do that or not.
Who sends letters by mail? These days we have e-mail.
If something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.
Tom said he hopes you don't want to do that.
Tom said he wanted he wasn't there.
I thought you said you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they weren't in a hurry.
We may need to be in Australia for several weeks.
I didn't plan to do that, but I can if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
Tom said he expected Mary to participate.
I swim every day.
Who's the lucky guy?
They pretended they didn't know me.
I know that Tom is a little shorter than Mary is.
Tom will do that if no one stops him.
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
You know Tom and I are not gonna do that, are you?
Tom and Mary told me they finished doing this by 2:30.
I'm sure we should have turned back there.
Everyone knows Tom talking good Gaulish.
I thought that maybe you wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he forgot something.
She doesn't like snakes and mathematics.
I knew Tom didn't want to do that, but he did it anyway.
Tom's really got a lot on his plate at the moment.
I knew that Tom knew who needed to do that.
I don't think you should drive.
Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair at all.
That's not exactly what I said.
They put their books down.
I know Tom is a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
This is not feasible with current technology.
They said they were trying to be optimistic.
Tom said everyone in his office spoke French.
I wonder if Tom already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think that Tom needs to do this by himself.
Tom and Mary said they were sick.
Tom said he's not allowed to do that.
I assume you're going somewhere with this.
Tom told me he thought Mary was thirty.
You have a sense of humor.
Tom said that he thought he should learn how to do this.
It's not something I want to discuss.
I think Tom will refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said that they needed my help.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Can you cook an omelette?
Tom said he knew I was coming.
No one asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
We hope you'll be in Boston next spring.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk anymore.
I wonder if we can do anything to help.
Tom said he'd be willing to help us do that.
I don't think Tom is capable of that.
Tom didn't know that he had to do this by himself.
Tom's dating a girl who's three years younger than he is.
I think Tom wouldn't refuse to do that.
Tom said he wasn't interested in sports.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I know Tom would be interested in doing this.
I think Tom will like this wine.
I believe we talked on the phone.
I know that Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
There's a certain amount of truth in what he's saying.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
I don't think Tom is a slob.
He is not a virtuoso.
I suspect Tom lied to me.
Tom will eventually need to do so.
Tom told me he'd call at 2:30.
Tom hasn't told Mary what he has to do yet.
I know Tom is a good diver.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
I knew I should have stayed home.
I don't think this is enough food to feed us all.
He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Tom said he planned to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed that my friends aren't here.
A wolf cannot be treated.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think that's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom says he didn't do anything wrong.
Tom didn't know what he should have been doing.
Tom said I should study harder.
They say they'll hurt me.
I know Tom might be tempted to do that.
I'm not sure I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't be paid.
Are you worried that this might happen?
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary did that.
Do not forget to take your umbrella when you leave here.
I'll see to it that gets done.
I wear a suit but don't wear a tie.
I'm as tired as you are.
Tom thought he might come down with a cold.
I think Tom hates waiting for me.
I should have apologized immediately.
You're lucky you didn't get hurt.
Where do Tom and Mary plan to live?
This tree is more than a century ago.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
I don't think that was the right thing to do.
Are you sure Tom will do that?
We can't live without air.
I didn't know that Tom hated Mary.
Tom says Mary has always lived in Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't nervous.
Tom knows something we don't.
Tom said he was worried about Mary.
We all got into the car.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that or not.
Last night I pocked.
Tom is not very good at bowling.
Tom said Mary gave him something.
Give me some water.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be mad.
I don't think you were paying attention.
We will need more time.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary is doing.
Tom said Mary's gonna do that tomorrow.
You are both welcome to come with us.
I can't believe that Tom is actually doing that.
It's not something anyone can do.
Tom said he ate too much.
We're all looking forward to your coming.
I think Tom won't stop doing that anytime soon.
Have I ever told you guys about the first time I met Tom?
I started studying French when I was 13 years old.
Tom said he wished he hadn't played chess with Mary.
I know that Tom will probably give you permission to do that.
Is it okay if I ask Tom to help me?
Tom said that Mary knew that John might not have had to do this by himself.
I wonder if Tom is motivated.
Tom said he would have done that if he thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know you were supposed to do that.
I think Tom wouldn't like it if Mary did that.
I still wish you would do that.
Mary let me know that she wasn't planning to stay very long.
I didn't know you were gonna be jealous.
Tom didn't know Mary had children.
They say they can't wait that long.
I'm surprised that you didn't know Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom may be lonely.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't very busy.
I'm absolutely sure that's not gonna happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said that he was glad you did that for Mary.
I think Tom knew where Mary was going to do that.
Tom has no idea where Mary is planning to do that.
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to help them do that.
You're very upset.
I've already finished reading this book.
I knew Tom wouldn't be a very good teacher.
I didn't know you were rich.
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston.
You finished your homework, didn't you?
What could have happened?
I don't think that Tom knows whether Mary likes him or not.
I got lost in the forest.
I know Tom is a good dmmer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band.
Tom told me he'll be in Boston next Monday.
Keep your mouth shut!
Tom said he knew he might have to do that Monday.
Tom said he regretted what had happened.
It is never too late to learn.
Tom didn't tell Mary that he had to do this.
Tom knew Mary was sick.
Do you have a pen on you?
Tom lets Mary do what she wants to do.
I'll wait until 2:30.
My parents won't let me do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much time it'll take for him to do that.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why didn't you eat the food I cooked?
I know you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried on his father's clothes.
I suspect Tom wouldn't tell Mary why he did that.
Tom said he was trying to do that all week.
You have really beautiful teeth! are they real?
No one knew that Tom was the person who contributed most of the money.
Everyone knew that Tom didn't want to stay in Boston.
Tom said he didn't have to go to school tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was frustrated.
Tom and I were both a little confused.
I'm sure Tom knew that was gonna happen.
Tom told me he thought he could do that.
I admitted I did what Tom said I shouldn't do.
Did you know that Tom and Mary had three children?
It's not just a small problem.
I am not satisfied with your explanation.
I know Tom's finished doing that already.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should have done that.
There must be a reason that Tom isn't here.
It's not right to be late for a dinner party.
Tom told me he thought Mary could run faster than he could.
Tom said Mary's scared.
You should have been the last one to do that.
I know Tom is a farmer, but I don't know where his farm is.
Tom says the matter is urgent.
Tom said Mary doesn't like doing that.
What could be wrong?
No one could have stopped that.
Tom said he had to share a hotel room with a stranger.
I know I said I would do it, but I can't do it today.
I think Tom is overemotional.
I am immune to smallpox.
Tom sometimes sleeps on my couch.
My class was cancelled.
Tom and Mary told me that it should be gone by the time they got here.
Tom promised me he'd be here by 2:30.
Tom said he thought Mary could take care of herself.
It's not as cold here as I expected it to be.
Tom said he just got back from Australia.
I don't think I'll be alone.
I can't work now.
The game's about to start.
Tom said Mary was born in Boston.
I think Tom won't be surprised.
I know Tom would be willing to do that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was jealous.
Does anyone else know you're here?
Tom said he wanted to go to the zoo.
Tom said he thought Mary was unhappy in Boston.
Didn't you know that Tom wasn't planning on doing that?
I know that Tom knew who was gonna do that for me.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
I don't think Tom knows that Mary's not happy.
That's not my pen.
I don't think I can do this without Tom.
Tom said he didn't think the noise bothered Mary.
No one ran.
Tom said Mary would probably do that.
I met someone who knows that we are.
Tom said he thought those shoes were too expensive.
Tom said he knew he might not have to do that.
It was just a joke.
Tom said he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same.
I should have brought more food.
I'm worried Tom's gonna get lost.
They told me they were next.
I suspect Tom and Mary are not as eager to do that now as they were yesterday.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't tyklish.
I know that Tom did that just to make Mary jealous.
I know you're smarter than that.
We're sorry for the inconvenience.
That's not the main reason I want to do that.
Tom didn't look back.
I know I'm ugly.
Tom told me he called you.
I know that Tom didn't know that you shouldn't have been doing that.
Tom and Mary told me they ate too much.
He's old enough to drive a car.
Tom said he thought he forgot to shut the door.
I know that Tom's afraid people can laugh at him.
Tom said Mary was probably still mad.
Tom and Mary say they feel better now.
They hate strangers; I hate everyone.
Tom said he's not sure Mary can swim.
I don't know if Tom's coming tomorrow or not.
They said they were very busy.
I promise you we'll find a bigger place.
I think Tom is the only one who has to do that.
I didn't think you'd win.
I don't think Tom will have the time to do this with us today.
I know that Tom is very opinioned.
We can't let these upstarts push us around.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's boyfriend is.
I knew Tom knew who could do that and who couldn't.
Tom and Mary don't think they've ever met you.
Tom said Mary was worried about the weather.
Tom is not so sure.
Everyone here knows we don't eat a pig.
Let's hope that's the last time that happens.
I know that Tom didn't know that you shouldn't have done that.
I think Tom doesn't know how to do that.
I've already told Tom that I don't plan on doing that.
I thought it would be fun to live in Boston for a year or two.
It's not healthy to skip meals.
I'm glad to meet you.
I know Tom can handle Mary.
I suspect Tom and Mary are the ones who did that.
I bet I can sit here longer without saying anything more than you can.
It's not done yet.
I know Tom's not on the team anymore.
I know that Tom doesn't know he shouldn't be doing that.
Tom just turned the radio on.
Tom has already decided that he won't say yes.
I know that Tom is a little snobbish.
What's in the box?
Tom said Mary knew he might not want to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're not alone.
Tom said he would have done that by himself if he could.
Acknowledging that there is a problem is the first step to fix the problem.
Mary said she planned to go.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be absent.

I don't think it's right.
I don't have to do anything I don't want to do.
Tom and Mary weren't planning to do this until John asked them to.
If you had left home a little earlier, you would have been on time.
You can't be too careful when driving.
Tom said Mary thought he might want to do that tonight.
Tell Tom I'm coming.

Why does everyone think Tom and I are stupid?
What are the positive sides?
The battery indicator light shows that the battery is not charged.

I have nothing to do!
I thought Tom might know where Mary put the key.
I don't think I'm being unreasonable.

They say they'll pay for everything.
Tom said he assumed you would do that.
They are fascinated by blood and violence.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want this.
No one knows exactly where Tom's going.
You should make sure you don't make Tom angry.
I didn't know that we weren't supposed to do that by ourselves.
Some think it's a bad idea.
How do I know you're not gonna try to kill me?
I wonder if Tom really went to Boston.

You never know what's going to happen tomorrow.
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who needed to do that.

I figured it should be good.
It may be good to do so.
I thought Tom had seen me.
If I knew Tom's address, I would have written to him.

Do you have a vegetable pellet?
I know you need to go to Boston.
I knew Tom was a bum.
I have a question.
Tom takes a shower every morning.

I think Tom could be just the person we need.
This isn't astonishing at all.
I know that Tom knows he's not supposed to do that.
I thought Tom would know how to do that.
I think Tom is doing that, too.
Tom said he heard someone snoring.
I seriously doubt that Tom will think it's a good idea to do that.
Tom knows the time runs out.
I think it was Tom's mistake.

I hope I don't say anything stupid.
I'm sorry I took so long.
Tom's gonna be very sorry he didn't do that.
They let me know they wouldn't do that.
I'm sorry I can't come today.
Tom and Mary are both scared.
I thought Tom looked exhausted.
It's not likely to rain tomorrow.
I know I can rely on you.
I know Tom did that correctly.
Stop criticizing me!
Tom says he didn't do it.
I'm looking for you.
Tom said he knew I wasn't gonna cry.
Tom said we couldn't do anything about it.
I think Tom is just curious.
Everyone knows that Tom was the one who broke the window.
Here's my pink notebook.
I knew I could trust you!
I don't think Tom knows what he wants.
I didn't know that Tom didn't have to do that by himself.
It's not like Tom's going anywhere.
Tom told me that he was hesitant to do that.
I pretended I didn't know what to do.
I know Tom is a bum.
I didn't think Tom would let you do that.
I want to go and change into that shirt I bought yesterday.
Tom said he thought Mary was lying.
We should have stayed with you.
I don't think Tom is lonely.
This is not the first time I did this.
If Tom can't do that, probably no one else can either.
I thought Tom could stop by this afternoon.
I think the economic impact will be minimal.
You should let Tom know that Mary is going to do that.
It would have been fun doing that.

I don't think Tom will need our help.
Tom said Mary was nervous.
Tom and Mary said they were over thirty.
I think Tom expected Mary to ask him to stay.

I know Tom was at your house today.
Tom's not gonna be able to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they were going to work.
Tom hasn't been told what happened yet.

Tom said Mary was unenthusiastic about that.
Tom said he wished he hadn't been so late.
They said they were suspicious.
Did you know that Tom was planning on moving to Boston?
Tom said that he assumed that Mary would want to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't done that.
I thought that was what we were supposed to do.
I'll never do that to you.
Tom should have been faster in doing this than Mary.
Tom and Mary said they planned to go on Monday.
That's not what Tom really needs.
They know they can do better.
There's no way Tom would have done what you said he did.
Tom said he was not allowed to do that anymore.
You're tired, aren't you?
Did Tom do that by himself?
Tom and Mary say they used to study French.
Tom admitted he'd kill Mary.
I would have been there by now if my car hadn't been broken.
We are brothers.
I wrote a long letter to Tom.
It's gonna be difficult to find someone to replace Tom.
I don't think giving Tom a knife was a good idea.
I thought you were gonna kill me.
I think there's a possibility that Tom will do that.
It is surprising that they should have a second house in America.
They told me that they were depressed.
My mother can't drive a car at all.
There's a lot that's happening right now.
I wonder if Tom is rich.
It's not necessary for me to do that.
I didn't think anyone noticed what Tom did.
I think you're bossy.
Tom backed his car up to check, but the raccoon he ran over was dead as a doorbell.
Tom and Mary said they're not mad.
I wonder if Tom ever told Mary about what we did that day.
Close that door.
The only reason Tom went to Australia because everyone else in his family did.
I thought Tom would ask Mary to the prom.
Are you sure no one can see us?
He has a great fancy for travelling.
Tom said Mary was probably still in prison.
I'm not sure Tom would let anyone help Mary.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were jealous.
Tom and Mary told me they were home.
I think you know we need to buy some more food.
I'm surprised Tom didn't want to go with us.
I asked Tom and Mary if they knew anyone who taught French.
Tom must have left his umbrella on the bus.
They told me they were broken.
No one but Tom did that.
I don't think Tom will be surprised that it happened.
I assume you're not interested in going with us.
It's not easy to understand by everyone.
I'm hungry.
Tom said that he thought he was the only one who needed to do that.
I thought you might want something cold to drink.
Tom told me he wouldn't go to Boston unless I went with him.
No one saw them.
Tom told me he thought Mary was sleeping.
Tom said he would definitely do that this week.
That's not my responsibility.
I think Tom is a student in Harvard.
I didn't know I was doing that wrong way.
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was happy that it was going to happen.
If it wasn't for the storm, I would have arrived sooner.
They said they would do this for us.
I thought you were just dating girls who were shorter than you.
Tom said that he thought the prices at that store were too high.
Tom said he didn't feel like eating.
Tom spends a lot of money buying things he never uses.
I thought you said I could count on you.
Tom said he sold his car three weeks ago.
Tom spent the money his grandmother gave him on books.
This is the first time I've been away from my family for more than three weeks.
You should have said so at that time.
Tom and Mary say they're only gonna talk to you.
Tom told me he didn't have as many friends as Mary did.
I parked my car here many times and no one complained.
Tom said he was sad.
Tom said he didn't think Mary needed to tell John what to do.
Tom said he was going home.
I didn't know Tom was gonna be arrested.
I know I'm gonna regret this.
Tom thought Mary was bored.
Tom thought Mary would be ready to do that.
Do you have any idea when Tom's planning to get here?
I know you're not planning on staying in Boston.
I wonder if that could happen again.
I suspect Tom and Mary are from Boston.
I couldn't keep looking at it.
I think Tom doesn't know Mary can speak French.
The evidence currently available does not allow me to make such a claim.
Tom said he's very sure Mary has to do that.
Tom would have been happy if you had done that.
Tom said he wanted to talk to you.
I thought you were a doctor.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Tom said he needed to stay home.
I thought you were happy.
I could have stopped it.
It's not healthy to eat and run.
I didn't think Tom would be forgiven.
Tom said Mary was asked not to do that.
We are invited to dinner.
Tom and Mary said they felt rejected.
I know Tom's afraid he'll get lost.
I ate the same thing Tom did.
I know that Tom would be able to convince Mary to do that if he tried to.
Tom thinks I'm missing a great opportunity.
I know that Tom is not a very good guitar player.
Tom and I were both impressed.
Everyone knows Tom's lying.
They're not as young as they say they are.
Don't expect anyone to help you.
Did you know that Tom wasn't planning to do that?
I never thought I'd go there.
You know that's not true.
I know Tom and Mary have already left Australia.
You're not like anyone else I know.
Tom and Mary said they felt the same way.
Tom is probably planning to stay in Boston until October.
Tom thought you could take care of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
Tom has decided that he's not going to work today.
Tom denied that he was the one who asked Mary to do so.
I wish I could speak French as well as Tom.
That's not happening!
I knew Tom wouldn't be caught.
It's not gonna work out.
I'm afraid I need to ask you a few questions.
Tom said that Mary thought that John might not be allowed to do so.
I think Tom lives in Australia.
Tom told Mary and I that we should try to do this by ourselves.
You know it's not like that.
I would've been unable to do that without your help.
I knew Tom really didn't want to do that by himself.
Tom said he's looking forward to his retirement.
Whether we do that now or later doesn't matter.
Let's hope things stay this way.
I should've anticipated that Tom wouldn't get along with Mary.
I think it's very unlikely that Tom was not aware that he would not be allowed to enter the museum without his parents.
I wonder if Tom really knows the combination to this safe.
Someone's singing.
Mary doesn't plan to do that until I tell her to.
I didn't know you were supposed to do that this afternoon.
Tom said he thought he knew the cause of the accident.
I didn't realize Tom didn't like Mary.
I don't think that can be fixed.
I didn't think Tom really wanted to know.
Tom didn't even know that Mary used to live in Boston.
I didn't know you needed to do that today.
You should have enroled your children months ago.
I think that's not mine.
I believe Tom is thirty years old.
Think about it.

I thought Tom might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I didn't think anyone had ever done that kind of thing before.

That's not something I know how to do.
I think I'll be able to fix it myself.
I didn't think anyone did that.

Tom said he should do that.
Are you sure Mary said she was planning to do that tomorrow?
There were times I would have been lost without Tom.
I know you're interested.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was crazy.
Tom already knows that Mary did that.
You're not as smart as Tom.
I don't think I really need to do that.
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are.
It's not gonna end well.
I think I need someone to help me.
Tom wrote in all caps.
Tom will be very happy he didn't do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that alone.
If I were you, I would go home at once.
It's not like you knew what they were gonna do.

So what are you suggesting?
Tom said he learned something new.

It was clear that Tom was going to do that.
They're not sure they should do that.
The kind of information we need is not always available.

We can't turn back.
I know that Tom knows we shouldn't do that.

You're so lazy.
Tom and Mary said they weren't Canadian.
Tom and Mary told me that they were sick.

They must have been tired.
Tom is doing OK.
Tom said he thought he didn't need to do that.
Tom said that Mary knew that he might not want to do so until John had time to help him.

I should never have brought you into this.

I was surprised when Tom told me that he wanted to do that.
I hope I'll see Tom tomorrow.
How much water does it take to fill your swiming pool?

Tom said that he thought Mary would probably want to do that.
Tom said he would come, but he never showed up.

Did you know your socks don't match?
You know that has to be done today, don't you?
I think that Tom is about to start crying.
She took him by the arm.
Tom said he felt intimidated.
It's not worth the effort.
Someone's waiting in your office.
I'm sorry we dragged you into this.
Tom said he's not thirsty.
Tom told me Mary did that wrong.
I knew that Tom might be hurt if he tried to do that.
Isn't that what you would have done?

Yet, every so often, the oath is taken in the gathering of clouds and storms. At these moments, America has carried on not just because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our predators, and true to our founding documents.

I know that Tom is not a very good hitter.
I don't think I'm the best person for the job.
They say they'd be willing to help us.
It is not open for discussion.
Tom told everyone that he was unemployed.
I know it'll be hard to do.
How are you planning on doing this?
It's beyond me.
I'm a little out of shape!
Didn't you know that Tom was seeing someone else?
It's gonna be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I should have been more careful.
Tom and Mary thought they were cute.
I thought you learned that by now.
I never said I could understand French.
Tom is just as smart as Mary.
They wished they didn't say that.
I wonder if Tom is planning to quit his job.
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be motivated to do so.
I'm going crazy.
Tom thought Mary would be embarrassed.
I hope I get a chance to go to Boston.
I'm glad no one's around.
Tom said he hoped Mary would like the gift that he was planning to give her.
I don't think we have a choice.
Tom couldn't defend himself.
Do what Tom tells you to do.
Saturday is the last day of the week.
I know that Tom will probably know how to do this.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be rude.
I know that Tom knows why we didn't do that on Monday.
Who's your favorite song?
I promise you I'll help you.
Tom said that he knew that Mary might not want to do that again.
Tom thinks he left his mob on the train.
I'm a lot longer than Tom.
I know that Tom can speak French. I wonder if Mary can, too.
I know that Tom would be faster at doing that than Mary.
My handwriting is better than Tom's.
Hello, what's your name?
They say they won't be here tomorrow.
Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
I assume this is due to the fact that Tom is a minor.
I always suspected Tom was a little paranoid.
I know that Tom knew I was planning to do that.
You should have been able to do that much better.
We work every day but Monday.
I know you weren't the ones who did that.
Tom said he doesn't have the power to stop it.
I know that Tom and Mary are married.
I should have been here yesterday.
It's not heavy.
That's why Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I was getting married.
Tom told me he'd probably cry.
I thought they'd find someone else.
I was the only one there who knew that Tom didn't want to do that.
I seriously doubt that Tom did this on purpose.
I figured you might be busy now.
Tom said he thought we should do this by ourselves.
I don't think this is an exception.
I know you don't like me very much.
I thought it was necessary for us to do anything about that today.
Tom has a lot of things he wants to do today.
Tom said something the other night about that.
Tom admitted he wasn't brave.
I know I should have done that.
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
I suspect Tom is waiting for us.
Dogs who are dead can't bite.
I don't think that Tom is as crazy as some people think.
I don't think I'll be able to do that by myself.
Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do this for us.
She avoided his eyes.
Tom's not as fat as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do that by ourselves.
Tom says Mary is still planning to do that.
I thought Tom must be wrong.
Tom said Mary didn't care what he did.
They said they didn't like that.
Tom was the reason Mary moved to Boston.
I should have introduced myself.
Tom said Mary is looking forward to being retired.
I can't remember when he moved to Boston.
I've never fallen in love with anyone.
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about that.
Tom is loved by everyone.
I didn't think anyone thought you were crazy.
He doesn't have a mobile.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought John might not be allowed to do so by himself.
There is no need for Tom to do that.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
I suspect Tom is involved.
How many kilos have you lost?
Both Tom and Mary are OK.
I'm a disgusting human being.
I will never forget the time you and me went to Australia together.
Tom's not the only one who's planning to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary both decided not to leave.
Tom told me he was sleeping.
Mary tried on her mother's clothes.
Tom admitted that he stole Mary’s bicycle.
I pried off the lid.
Tom said that Mary was likely in Australia now.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that here.
I'm three years older than you are.
When is your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
I would have helped you.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary were already married.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We can't play baseball here.
Tom and Mary say they won't mind.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said you had fun doing that.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston.
I've been on a diet for more than a year.
Tom said he wasn't willing to help us do that.
Tom thought Mary had already a driver's license.
I know that Tom is a pretty good drummer.
Tom realized that he wouldn't be able to change anything.
Tom said Mary should have done that alone.
I didn't know you were still living with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy weathervane.
Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian?
Come on, guys, this isn't funny anymore.
I suspect Tom is at home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me they would do it again.
Tom threw up.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Tom must have left the water running.
I'm a farmer.
It's not easy to get married to Tom.
I didn't know there was a pool of swimming here.
Tom and Mary say they're not concerned.
Tom didn't stay in Boston for as long as he wanted.
Tom said he was a Canadian.
I'd like to have another cup of coffee.
I assume that Tom is still married to Mary.
Tom said everyone he knows enjoys doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
I know that Tom probably can do that sometime today.
Do you let your children play in the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom doubts that Mary can do that.
There is a cat under the desk.
I think Tom is unkind.
I don't think Tom knows when it happened.
Is it true Tom moving to Boston?
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
I thought you looked tired.
Tom said I looked impatient.
I think Tom could make Mary do that.
I'm interested in chess these days.
I don't think I'd like to live in Australia.
Tom said Mary should have done that by herself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was misled.
What you're saying is absolutely wrong.
He is depressed.
I know I have to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary was thirsty.
They said they didn't enjoy doing that.
I'm peeling apples.
They said they would never study French.
They said they thought I was a creative one.
Tom told me he's sure what he should do.
Tom told me I should have said yes.
Tom did not press the button.
There was nothing left in the refrigerator.
Tom said that he knew that Mary might not have to do so.
I knew Tom would probably not have to do that.
Tom said he didn't know that Mary couldn't speak French very well.
I don't think there's any chance I'll get there on time.
I think both Tom and Mary are going to be busy tomorrow.
Tom said he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he didn't plan to go with us this weekend.
I don't think that Tom is sure that's what Mary wants to do.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to buy what he needed for three hundred dollars.
Everybody likes free stuff.
I don't think this is funny.
If Tom does that, I will, too.
I know Tom is still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they were ready to help me.
Tom is not the one who told me that Mary should do this.
I thought you said you would still want to do that.
Tom said he was wondering whether Mary wanted to do that or not.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom's a very nice boy.
Tom and Mary said they didn't really expect anyone to do that.
Tom said that it was Mary who told him that he should.
Tom doesn't think Mary is annoyed.
I don't think I can hold on a long time.
Tom's not as long as Mary.
Tom said he didn't think the heat bothered Mary.
I know you're a coward.
You're lying!
I told Tom that I disagreed.
I think Tom's talking to Mary now.
I've already promised Tom I'd help him.
I believe everyone deserves a chance.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to be at the meeting.
Tom doesn't know that I have to do this today.
I don't think you really want to call attention to that.
Tom said he knew that Mary was the one who did that.
I thought Tom and Mary were gonna kill John.
Leave the lights on, please.
Tom said Australia is a nice place to visit.
I thought Tom was in great trouble.
I listened to everyone.
It doesn't work.
Tom's speech lasted for three hours.
I wonder if Tom is alive.
I might try to borrow a hatchet from Tom.
Tom may be surprised.
I don't think anyone would want to see that movie more than once.
I can't remember anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know that someone cares.
I think Tom won't be in Australia very long.
Tom told Mary he would never come back here.
I didn't know you couldn't do that yourself.
I suspect Tom will never agree to do that.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom is irresponsible.
I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two.
I know that Tom is more likely to do that today than he was yesterday.
I think Tom's doing something illegal.
Our streets flood when we get rain.
I'll probably be busy this afternoon.
I don't think you have a lot of choice.
Tom said he thought he could do that on October 20.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was planning to do that.
I knew that Tom might be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of cake.
I know that Tom is a very good dmmer.
We know you're working for them.
Everyone here except Tom has done that.
I think you should do it yourselves.
I think everyone has an idea of what Tom is capable of.
Tom knew he could have done that better.
Tom said he wanted Mary not to do that by herself anymore.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was unhappy.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I am a university student.
I think Tom didn't do that, but I could be wrong.
Which country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I made enough space for everyone.
I know that Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she needs to do that.
I don't think it would be a good idea to do that by ourselves.
Are you saying you don't want to do this?
I know that Tom can't stop me from doing that.
I can assure you that it's not gonna happen.
Tom plans to sit in the back.
Tom said he gave a book to Mary.
It would have been unbearable.
I know that Tom's probably gonna know how to do that.
I know Tom was a scrawny kid.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary know they're partly to blame.
I'm not surprised Tom's planning on doing this.
Anybody hardly expected Tom to win.
Don't twist my words!
I didn't think Tom realized how hard that job would be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put your jacket on if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to stay in Australia very long.
I hear you gave up smoking.
Tom obviously doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really likes doing that very much.
Tom may be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me he thought Mary was divorced.
Tom told me he was next.
Tom said that Mary knew that John might have to do this by himself.
Tom said he was good at speaking French.
This is not salt.
Did anyone see Tom here?
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
My dog sleeps in the same room that I do.
He did not keep his word.
I know that's not true.
Tom said he was planning on doing that.
I suspect Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible.
I know that Tom can speak French better than I can.
I suspect Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
Tom and Mary said they acted in self-defence.
Tom told me he thought Mary was careful.
Tom was sleeping on the sofa living room.
I found out both Tom and Mary like romantic novels.
Tom knows I didn't do that yesterday.
I suspect Tom and Mary were busy all day.
Tom told everyone that he was ready to do that.
We'll go on a piano if it's fine tomorrow.
Promise me you won't tell anyone
It's not Tom who needs protection.
They said they were upset.
I think Tom will probably be able to do that.
Tom did that whenever he could.
They said their houses weren't for sale.
I'm not fat.
I thought I wouldn't be able to do that.
I think we have more important things to do now.
I think Tom and Mary were to Boston at least once.
I don't think I know anyone here.
They say they want to win.
Tom knew that Mary was a teacher.
Tom told Mary that she should stop pretending to be asleep.
Can anyone please help me?
I know Tom is about the same age as your daughter.
I know that Tom is a very lucky guy.
Tom thought I might not be allowed to do that by myself.
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
I know Tom is easygoing.
I think Tom will be lonely.
It looks like Tom likes everyone.
I'm surprised Tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary has to settle into her new apartment.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you need to tell Tom you're planning to do that.
They swore they never did that.
Everyone stood there, shocked.
I'm looking forward to hearing why you think we should do that.
Tom told me he wasn't offended.
I regret that I wasn't as careful as I should have been.
Tom doesn't look too good.
Tom said he thought I should do that myself.
I don't think that Tom looks like his brother.
Tom said he heard noises in the kitchen.
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary is sleepy or not.
I know I made a mistake.
You were surprised that I did that, wasn't you?
They wished they could fly.
What a beautiful sunset!
I've seen Mt. Fuji.
Tom didn't know that the bridge was closed.
They said they don't like to do that.
I thought Tom would have found Mary by now.
Tom said he wouldn't mind if Mary did that.
You shouldn't just assume Tom is guilty.
Watch yourselves.
Mary said she wasn't planning on doing that.
Someone has to tell Tom what to do.
I didn't know that Tom did that when he was 13 years old.
Tom said he doesn't think you can win.
Tom and I are both veterinarians.
Tom said I was the only one who thanked him.
Enough enough!
I wonder if Tom knew I needed to do that.
Did you know that Tom did that?
I guess it's like that everywhere.
Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children.
It is not until you have lost your health that you realize its value.
That could have hit me.
They told me they're losing weight.
My house is not big.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do that.
You didn't know I was still planning on joining the team, did you?
The bathroom was not very clean.
They said they were safe.
Tom said he didn't think he would ever be able to convince Mary to go out with him.
Tom thought Mary would be the first to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was ambitious.
This is something I made for you.
I don't think I'm drunk enough to enjoy this kind of music.
Tom said he thought he could do that if he had some help.
Except for Tom, everyone did that.
She has been sick for three weeks.
Tom said he wished he could speak French better.
I can't dance.
Tom hasn't got a prayer.
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
I know that Tom knew I was the one who had to do that.
Tom's not missing, is he?
I left my umbrella in the phone booth.
I did something bad.
I suspect Tom would be interested in doing so.
I promised Tom that I would do that.
I thought Tom would never show up.
That's too good to be true.
Tom said doing that would be fun.
Tom found it difficult to obey.
Courgettes are green.
I should never have broken up with Mary.
I wish I was in Australia right now.
Tom knew I'd be early.
Tom threw his dog some bread.
What does this have to do with us?
How do I know you're telling me the truth?
Tom didn't know that I was supposed to do that.
That's just not possible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything.
I'm pretty sure I can do that.
Tom says he and Mary will spend Christmas Day together.
Why did you fail in the entrance examination?
Tom found it difficult to remain impartial.
Tom told me he had to leave.
Tom says he can't prove Mary did that.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were bored.
Tom said he's glad you're coming.
Tom thought Mary was really mean.
I know there'll be a lot of good food in the piano.
Does anyone have any questions so far?
I suspect Tom is reluctant to do that.
Tom was never afraid of anyone.
They said they'd rather come next week.
What are you referring to?
Tom said that he thought Mary was amused by what was going on.
Everyone in the room did the same thing.
They are inseparable.
Tom didn't know you were the one who wanted to do that.
They promised they wouldn't do that.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You must have done that last year.
Can you take a picture of me?
We should have expected that to happen.
It would have been wise to do that.
Tom told me he didn't have a problem with that.
Tom said that Mary shouldn't have walked home by herself.
Tom must be irritated.
How long has your head been hurt?
Thank you, bud!
Tom said no one was fired.
Do you think we should have gone to where Tom wanted us to go instead of come here?
He has heartache.
I don't think Tom wants to do that by himself.
I'm not sure I can trust Tom.
Tom said it was Mary who told him that he needed to do that.
Tom was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
I'm assuming that the gun I heard was the one who killed Tom.
It's not just my problem.
Tom told me he thought Mary was high.
I know Tom is a millionaire.
Tom said that he thought that doing this would be safe.
I don't think I'll allow Tom to do that.
No pain, no gain.
I admit I did that.
I think Tom doesn't eat meat.
I hope we don't have problems with Tom.
Here's your bag.
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about the noise.
I'll never tell anyone.
Tom didn't know Mary was a Canadian.
I think Tom is a good coach.
Tom and Mary told me they could help us.
I don't think it's unethical for you to do that.
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I know we can't count on Tom to do that for us.
I thought Tom dumped Mary a month ago.
I think Tom won't be the last one to do that.
Tom would have done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom is downstairs.
I need to know that we can depend on Tom.
Tom said Mary thought he might not be allowed to do so.
I realize that this is not very likely to happen.
They say that drugs aren't safe.
I know that it's very unlikely that anyone can help me.
I think Tom's gonna call you.
I didn't know you were such a superstitious person.
Tom said that he thought it would be a big mistake to tell Mary what had happened.
Tom thought Mary would probably not cry.
This work is enough to break my back.
That would never have happened if you had done what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wanted to go to Boston with us.
I can't.
We need to replace our water heater.
Does anyone have a clinex?
Tom told us that he thought he could become a famous singer.
We've already done that.
Tom is a hemophiliac.
I wouldn't have said anything.
Tom said he would be happy to answer any questions we had.
Tom said he knew you could do that.
Tom and I are both wrong.
I assume you still enjoy drinking beer.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were able to do that.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think Tom is the person you should be talking to.
Sami knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said that I had to study French.
You're not obliged to do that, are you?
You've got a big head.
He's very smart.
I would never have hired Tom.
Does Tom know that you already did that?
Tom ate more than I ate.
I didn't know that Tom was in Boston last Monday.
Tom said he didn't think anyone could do that.
Tom said Mary is probably still willing to do that.
Did anyone go to Australia with you?
Tom said he thought I'd like to do that.
Tom said he wanted me to show him how to do this.
I hope this is enough food for everyone.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early anymore.
I know that Tom knows that Mary will never be able to do that.
Tom said I should come home soon.
Tom and Mary are gonna get hurt if they're not careful.
Tom would have done that.
I didn't know that Tom told Mary he wasn't gonna do that.
I'd like to visit Boston again.
With teaching and studying my time is taken.
I think Tom is conceited.
I don't think Tom would like it if we did that.
I know that Tom doesn't know Mary won't be able to do that.
They say they'll stop doing that.
Tom is incompetent.
Tom thinks that Mary drinks like a fish.
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad I did.

Tom and Mary said they told you.
Tom said he thinks Mary can't do that.
I know that Tom is a golfer. Maybe he could teach you how to play.
I thought you knew Tom and Mary were married.
I knew Tom would be able to do that without some help.
I suggest you don't go to Australia in the winter.
What else are you planning to do?
I think Tom understood everything.
I know you're happy about that.
Tom's downstairs.
I know Tom is talkative.
It's not my business.
Mary has a big postcard collection.
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money.
Tom says you're willing to help.
I assume you would like to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary came back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary good night last night.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I knew Tom wasn't a bad student.
It's unlikely Tom will do that.
Is it difficult to milk a goat?
Do you think we'll ever find our way back to the camp?
Tom doesn't know I have three cats.
I should have quit while I was in front.
Is anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
My grandmother texts faster than you.
Do Tom and Mary both live in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought you said you would do that for Tom.
I didn't think anyone noticed what you did.
I wonder if I could help Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interesting.
You're not the only one here who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here.
I know this isn't hard.
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't ready to do that yet.
I thought you might be hungry.
I assumed Tom had told you I'd be here.
Did you know Tom was going to be in Australia all week?
Tom said he didn't know that Mary was eventually gonna leave him.
You're not afraid yet, are you?
I thought you'd cry.
The value of health cannot be overestimated.
You will suffer because of that.
I don't think Tom knows exactly how much it's gonna cost.
Tom said he's healthy.
I know Tom is nice.
Tom already knows Mary's planning to do that.
Don't take off your gloves.
Keep it up!
Tom said he wasn't gonna do that again.
Tom should have been able to show you how to do this.
Tom said that he and Mary left early because Mary was sick.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unfriendly.
Put your pants on.
They said they weren't ready to talk.
I know that Tom isn't the one who's supposed to do that.
I admit I have despised Tom since the first time I met him.
Are there many Africans in Germany?
Where did you put the TV guide?
Tom said Mary wasn't pretty.
It is true that the earth is round.
Tom couldn't help smiling.
Tom doesn't like people to know that he can't speak French well.
Check out that girl.
Tom told Mary that she should stop pretending to be handicapped.
I told Tom that you would come to Australia.
Tom thinks that's a mistake.
I knew Tom was a reasonable guy.

I'm sorry, but I can't eat dinner with you.
It's not safe to go out after darkness yourself.
Did you know Tom had a son?

Tom and Mary said they're not likely to win.
Tom told me he was forgiven.
Tom said he thought Mary would do that tomorrow.
Tom knows there's only one possible course of action.
Tom and Mary said they tried very hard to win.
They say they have lost their keys.
I've decided never to do that again.
I didn't know you were dating Tom.
I think Tom hasn't made a decision yet.
I know you still want to do that.
Please tell Tom and Mary that they are not required to do this.
Good job, guys!
I know that Tom doesn't know that he's not supposed to be doing that today.
Tom and Mary say they don't want to do that.
Tom hopes he doesn't have to live in Australia for more than a year.
Don't you know that everyone's talking about us?
Tom said that Mary knew he didn't want to do that until next Monday.
I know Tom's house is for sale.
I don't think Tom is sad.
I don't think Tom will really win.
I would have wanted to do that with you.
I'm not interested in sex.
Tom told everyone that he was determined to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was strict.
Tom said he thought Mary might have to do this by herself.
We wish we could have done more to help.
Tom said he thought it would snow tonight.
I promised Tom I'd be home early.
Tom said he would look at it.
Tom said that doing that was more difficult than he thought it would be.
You'd love the movie.
They told me they don't really care what's going on.
Tom's speech wasn't as long as Mary's.
I didn't know that Tom would be willing to show me how to do that.
I'm sorry I bothered you.
Everyone looks scared but you.
Tom was afraid that his parents would start asking him questions and that he would end up telling them everything.
Was the book you were reading in French yesterday?
I'm a doer of damage.
Tom didn't know I was from Australia.
You could have gone.
Tom said he didn't think the smell bothered Mary.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
I thought you were a better chess player than this.
I'm glad to see Tom's happy again.
I thought Tom had already left.
I knew Tom would not be able to keep Mary from doing that.
I don't think we have much time.
Tom said he's trying to hide Mary.
I don't think Tom would have done that for me.
Tom is the funest person I've ever met.
I doubt Tom really plans to do that.
Tom said that he thought Mary might not have to do this week.
I know that Tom knows he doesn't need to do that.
To tell the truth, I am not your father.
I don't think Tom will do that with Mary.
That's the real reason Tom ran away from home, isn't it?
I thought you could walk Mary home.
Tom said that he hoped Mary would try to do that.
You like chocolate, right?
I don't think Tom really had to do that this morning.
Tom says he knows Mary can't speak French very well.
Tom didn't tell me where he was planning to stay in Boston.
Tom didn't have to come here.
They said that they enjoyed the challenge.
I know Tom was late.
Tom told me he was going home.

I should have paid in advance.
We're going to the airport.
I doubted Tom would be able to talk to Mary to do that.
It's not Tom's idea, it's mine.
I didn't think anyone else had noticed.
That cat is so cute!
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't know I wasn't gonna do that.
I know Tom is a mechanic.
A jack of all trades is master of none.
I wonder if Tom is satisfied.
I know you still want to be with me.
Tom told me that he was unemployed.
I didn't know you could understand French.
I doubt you will be happy with my report.
I should've known Tom would do that.
Tom told me he used to live in Australia.
I'm glad you succeeded.
It will take not less than one hour to go there.
I knew Tom wouldn't pass the test.
You can use my office if you want.
I think Tom would agree with me.
Don't stay too long!
I know Tom is popular.
It makes sense.
Tom said he really did that without anyone's help.
I wonder if Tom is ready to do that.
I don't think Tom would care if you did that today.
I know that Tom used to be a speech coach.
He can't swim a mile.
Tom said he probably wouldn't do that.
Tom said Mary was upset.
I don't think Tom is a good lawyer.
Tom's gonna have to figure it out.
Are you absolutely sure Tom has to do that?
They said they hope it will happen soon.
Tom said he's not being used.
I thought I had nothing to lose.
By the morning the storm was over.
No one I know really wants to do that.
I think Tom is expecting someone to make dinner for him.
They said they don't want to do that.
The price of gasoline is so high that we cannot buy a big car.
Why didn't you tell me you knew how to do that already?
Tom told me he hoped Mary would be discreet.
"Thanks." "For what?" "For everything."
You are a teacher.
A lot of men, a lot of minds.
Anything is possible.
Tom and Mary told me that they were unhappy.
Tom and Mary say they need to do that.
Let's hope it never happens again.
I don't think that actually happened.
Tom said Mary was arrested before.
Tom said Mary's not ready.
I don't think Tom knows everyone's name.
Tom had trouble admitting he was wrong.
I thought you might want to play a game of chess.
Tom said he thought Mary would be impressed.
I know it's very unlikely that anyone knows me.
Tom said he wasn't sure he could do it.
Are you gonna be OK?
They told me they were sick.
I thought something was serious wrong with Tom.
Tom said he's not sleeping yet.
Tom assumed that everyone knew that Mary was going to do that.
I know that Tom probably shouldn't do that anymore.
I had no idea Tom could do that.
It looks like Tom's waiting for someone.
Tom said he thought Mary was probably having a good time in Boston.
You broke the computer.
I'm afraid you'll get lost.
They say they like to study French.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's favorite flower is.
I knew Tom was ready to do that.
I suspect Tom's probably gonna do that.
Tom said he was gonna stay up all night.
I didn't know Tom was a veteran.
I thought that was what you wanted me to buy.
My daughter often experienced asthma attacks as a child.
I knew Tom didn't know you were the one who did that.
We've already met everyone.
Tom said there were still many things left to do.
You don't have a chance.
If Tom had enough money, he would have gone to Boston with Mary.
Tom told everyone that he was happy that it was going to happen.
You always doubt my word.
I didn't know I couldn't do what Tom asked me to do.
There's a good chance we'll win.
Tom says he knows Mary can win.
I know that Tom is not a baseball fan.
I knew Tom would ask Mary to do that.
I think Tom shouldn't agree to do that.
I don't think Tom has sold anything all day.
I think I'm too old for her.
I don't think I should have left early.
I didn't say I was going to Australia.
Tom should have stayed in Boston for a few more days.
I should have told Tom sooner.
Tom and Mary said they didn't like to do that.
Tom'll remember.
It's not something I think I can do.
Tom told me where he was planning to stay.
I know you're not planning to stay in Australia.
I know Tom was implyed.
Do you have a pencil I can borrow?
Tom also wanted to do so.
I could have done that for you.
I think Tom is home.
It is painful for America to lose our young men and women.
Tom should do everything they tell him.
Everyone but Tom knew that he didn't have to go to Australia.
What is the most beautiful place in the world?
The storm caused a lot of damage to the crop.
I don't think everyone has given up.
Let's get our photo taken.
I knew it wouldn't be easy.
Suddenly all the lights went out.
Tom and Mary said they'd probably win.
I think Tom would be upset if you did that.
Tom and Mary thought they'd find other jobs.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early.
I know I should stay and help.
Don't look at me.
I suspect Tom and Mary were planning to do that tomorrow.
I didn't know you knew how to drive a bus.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
I know Tom does that well.
Tom said nothing had changed.
That's not one of my priorities.
It's not something I can decide quickly.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to your party last night.
I know that Tom knows that I need to do that.
Stay out of this.
I know Tom's afraid he'll be fired.
If you had called the doctor.
I wasn't feeling very hungry.
I did everything you asked me to do.
Do you have a link I could borrow?
I didn't think we'd find anyone who could do that for us.
Tom is not an angel.
I think Tom is mad.
That sounds awesome.
Tom is driving over to Mary's apartment to give her something.
Tom said he thought Mary would wait.
Tom said he didn't think that smell bothered Mary.
Tom said he's willing to do this for us.
Can you believe Tom is still 13?
Tom sent Mary his picture.
Tom already knows that Mary's not planning to be here today.
They say they have never eaten Taiwan food.
I think that Tom and Mary have never been to Boston.
They're playing chess.
I thought I heard someone sing.
I heard Tom's plans to move to Australia.
It's not as hot here as I expected.
They don't think they'll do that.
I don't think I belong here.
No one saw Tom leave.
I knew Tom used to live in Boston.
Tom ran home to get something he forgot.
Tom told me he might win.
Tom had no problems with Mary.
I thought Tom refused to do that.
How do you know you're not missing me for someone else?
You should have refused to stay in Boston.
No one can save you.
I'm glad I didn't do that.
I'm starting to believe we're never gonna convince Tom that he's wrong.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
Tom should never have been released.
His train arrives at the main station at 5.50 p.m.
They said they couldn't wait.
Tom said that Mary thought that John might be required to do so by himself.
I know what I would do.
He didn't need to bring the umbrella.
Tom and Mary were not at home when we went to visit them.
Tom thinks I need to do this today.
Tom admitted he didn't do what we asked him to do.
It's a pity that we didn't visit Tom when we had the opportunity.
Tom told me you were with him yesterday afternoon.
Tom and I didn't know that we were the ones who were supposed to do that.
I'm so tired that I can hardly walk.
They felt that they needed to do something.
I read many foreign languages, but don't speak.
You set up a trap.
I should have added more salt.
I know that's not what you want.
I didn't know Tom and Mary used to be married.
I think Tom is smashed.
Tom and Mary say they'll never do that.
I think Tom's sorry.
You were skinny the first time I met you.
I think Tom could have gotten home by himself.
Tom and Mary both know who you are.
Mary said she didn't plan to do that by herself.
It's not supposed to be fun.
They said they were unimpressed.
Tom hasn't told us what he needs to do yet.
I know you probably didn't have to do that.
I wonder if Tom still remembers where we first met.
If only you had helped me yesterday, the problem would have been avoided.
Tom said he expected Mary to return to Boston on October 20th.
Tom said that he thought he might be required to do so again.
Tom thinks you want me to pay the bill.
Tom and Mary said they didn't swim.
I knew Tom told Mary that he couldn't do that.
Tom said he had to leave early.
They realize they're being ignored.
If Tom had left at 2:30, he would have gotten here by now.
Tom and Mary said they would.
There is no doubt that Tom used to live in Australia.
Tom has decided to stay in Australia for another three days.
Tom said he thought I looked unconcerned.
I should have stayed and helped Tom.
Tom said he thought I would be able to do that.
I figured Tom would panic.
Tom thinks he's the best swimmer here.
I wonder if it'll snow tomorrow.
I wonder if Tom is pleased.
I'm frying fish.
The wind calmed down the evening.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do so.
Slow down.
Tom would have done that by now if he was really planning to do it.
I know that Tom could do that if he really needed to.
We'll never know.
Tom admitted that he had killed Mary.
Didn't you know that your taillights weren't working?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom's never gonna hurt anyone again.
I'm learning Esperanto very fast.
You're not gonna get in trouble for helping me, are you?
I've heard that women spend more on shoes than men.
I think Tom will be excited.
We'll be landing in 15 minutes.
Tom said he would take care of Mary.
Tom's parents let him do whatever he wants to do.
I thought you were gonna fix that.
I hope I never have to do that.
Tom has already been told that he will not be allowed to do this.
They say they are not sure.
I know that Tom didn't know that he wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom should have told me earlier.
I have to go to the toilet.
Both men apologized to each other.
You're not doing anything wrong, are you?
Tom said Mary doesn't think John will actually do that.
They say that they also need to do so.
I know that Tom knows why Mary had to do that.
They told me they'd help me.
I don't think I'll ever be able to afford to buy a house.
Don't you think we have a chance to win?
They said they wouldn't speak French.
Tom thought Mary didn't like computer games.
Tom and Mary say they don't think they sneak.
I knew Tom was active in his church.
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
Tom said he'd found something.
A business is not charity.
Tom said he didn't think Mary had ever been to Australia.
I don't think that Tom is like looking good as John is.
Tom said that he thought that the prices at that store were too high.
I don't think anyone disputes that.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't remember.
Tom said he hoped he would be able to do that today.
You knew everyone at the party, didn't you?
Tom said Mary was not safe.
I'm sorry it happened like this.
I know that Tom's not afraid to walk through the woods alone.
Tom and I are angry.
I don't think Tom will be able to do that without some help.
It's hot.
Tom told me he didn't want to live in Boston.
No one asked me whether I loved it or not.
Many old people can't keep up with the times these days.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be blamed for the problem.
I know Tom appreciated that.
Tom told me he'd decided to do that.
It's a kind of cat.
Tom thought Mary would probably refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
Tom denied that he had accepted the bridge.
Tom said he thought that doing that would not be a good idea.
I admit I didn't do what Tom said I had to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was broken.
Tom told me he thought Mary was miserable.
Can't this wait until morning?
We'll be landing in 15 minutes.
We know that won't happen anymore.
They said they were really sorry.
Tom cleared his throat loudly.
I think Tom is unprejudiced.
I'm afraid I've lost it.
Tom said Mary was probably grudging.
We're both adults.
They're not as weak as they used to be.
I know Tom was supposed to do that.
Tom said he thought I should do that today.
Don't talk about business while we're eating.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard.
I hope Tom will be adopted by a good family.
Tom said he thought you knew Mary.
She has to be taken to the hospital.
I would have helped you if you had asked.
Okay.
Tom said he thought I was wearing a wig.
This is not a drill.
Tom should have done that a long time ago.
I think Tom slept all afternoon.
I wonder if Tom is upset.
Tom said that he knew they might not let him do that at school.
Tom said that he hoped Mary would like to do that.
Tom would have done that for Mary if he had more time.
I don't think you really need to do that.
Something's still not right.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom liked riddles.
I know Tom's not planning on going to Boston with you.
Tom said he's not sure Mary has to do this.
I didn't think Tom would be able to talk to Mary into doing that.
Is it true that Tom and Mary plan to stay in Boston until October?
I didn't know you didn't want to do that by yourselves.
Tom said he thought it would be fun.
I think you'll find out that it was Tom's fault.
I thought it was rather ingenious.
Do you know if Tom and Mary are going to do that?
What makes you think Tom and Mary were the ones who did that?
Are you still planning on doing this with Tom?
Tom said he didn't feel safe.
His younger sister is a famous TV star.
I know when you said you would be there, but I couldn't be there at that time.
I don't think they're complaining.
You and I both know that that's not true.
Let's assume that'll happen.
Tom told everyone that he didn't know what to do.
Tom needed someone he could trust.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was being honest.
It's quite likely Tom will come.
I doubt Tom will come to Boston this year.
I didn't think anyone had tried that before.
You should have made better use of your time.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom said it looked like Mary was having a really hard time doing that.
I'm learning Old English.
I want the rest of the money you owe me.
Tom said Mary could have done that alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard to get along with.
They said they were very drunk.
You could have told me earlier.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was conceited.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are skeptical.
I know Tom never does that anymore.
Tom says he only swears when it is absolutely necessary.
I don't think Tom is high.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
Tom said he thought Mary was interested in basketball.
Tom told me he thought this book was interesting.
Tom assumed everyone knew he couldn't do that.
Tom said he planned to go on October 20.
They said they're doing just fine.
Hostilities were resumed between the two powers.
The only reason Tom came to Australia was that everyone in his family did.
I would have done that if I could.
I thought Mary said she wasn't planning on doing that.
Tom assumed that everyone in school knew that he was arrested.
Tom wanted to know how to make Mary happy.
Tom said he saw Mary do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed the money.
Tom said he thought Mary would be able to do that.
I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary to do that.
Everybody knows Tom can't speak French very well.
My findings suggest that it is not the case.
Tom found the watch he lost.
I don't know anything about Boston.
Tom said that he thought it might be dangerous to do so.
Someone must have left the window open.
I know Tom is a messy person.
I'm sorry, sir.
I know Tom knew Mary was planning to do that.
Tom was just stating the obvious.
Tom said he wasn't offered a job.
Tom didn't know that Mary wasn't happy.
Tom said he would be able to do that in a few hours.
No one doubts that you will be able to pass the examination.
Where's everyone?
How were you feeling?
Fortune favors the brave.
They're not sure they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still staring at me.
I thought Tom had heard us.
It's not mandatory.
I hope no one comes.
What color was Tom wearing?
Tom and Mary would not ask you to do that for them if they could find anyone else to do it for them.
Tom said he'd walk Mary home.
It'll be hard for Tom to win.
We should have hired someone more qualified.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unimpressed.
I wonder if Tom knows he's overweight.
Tom said he didn't know why Mary went to Australia.
Tom told me that he was too tired to study.
Where's your baggage?
Both my parents are musicians.
I live in Groningen.
How do we know that that's not true?
Tom said he didn't want to die.
That's the car I want to buy.
Tom said that he thought Mary would be able to help him do that tomorrow.
I know Tom is a chubby.
Will it be a dry day tomorrow?
I'm not sure Tom's gonna be willing to talk to me.
Tom said he was happy Mary was able to win.
I didn't think you'd be able to get Tom to do that.
It's not raining.
I can't speak English, much less German.
Tom thought something bad would happen.
I thought that was what you would have wanted.
I know it's very unlikely that anyone knows me.
Where's Tom now?
Tom said Mary went to a divorce lawyer.
They said they knew they could win.
I doubt Tom will be reasonable.
Tom and I both enjoy playing volleyball.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit he's wrong.
Tom said he couldn't win.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that.
Tom said he couldn't do that anytime soon.
There's a possibility Tom won't want to go to Boston with us.
It's not enough to know only one language.
She's a blonde girl.
Tom thinks we can't do that.
I know Tom is a better tennis player than I am.
Tom said he's not mad.
Tom may have done the same thing as Mary did.
I know that Tom is a sophomore.
Tom certainly knew he shouldn't have eaten that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was interested.
I thought you were planning to be here early.
Tom said that Mary knew that John might not have had to do this until Monday.
Tom should never have tried to do that by himself.
How's your father?
My son is not a snob.
I would have let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said it was harder than they expected.
I don't think they're bad people.
They said they didn't want me to wait.
No one suspected it.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that alone.
I wonder if it'll really be hot tomorrow.
Is this the first time you've experienced this kind of pain?
Tom said that Mary knew she might not have to do this again.
They swore they wouldn't do that again.
I don't really plan to do that.
I know Tom will let you do that.
Tom said that Mary would do that.
They said they wouldn't do that.
Tom thinks Mary won't do that for John.
Tom said that he thought there was a good chance Mary would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would like it.
You're not the only one Tom asked.
Tom thought Mary wasn't finished doing that yet.
They put their notebooks away.
Tom and Mary said they felt uncomfortable.
I didn't know that Tom could actually do that.
I didn't say I used to live in Australia.
Tom said he knew why Mary wanted to do that.
Tom said he wanted to buy something for Mary.
I know Tom can't come to Boston, but I wish he could.
Tom said he thought Mary was over thirty.
We went up by two floors to reach the apparel stalls.
I don't think Tom is funny.
Tom thinks he's gonna die soon.
I thought Tom was sick.
I know that Tom didn't know why Mary was afraid to do that.
They said they would be happy to help.
Tom and I both want to go.
I didn't know you'd tell me.
Tom and Mary said they were jealous.
I thought I'd be able to do that for Tom.
Tom promised he would never make such a mistake again.
Don't you think we should have talked to Tom about this?
Tom told me he thought Mary was fat.
Tom told me that he thought Mary still wanted to go to Australia.
Don't sweat the little stuff.
I don't think anyone can help me now.
Tom said it's a very common problem.
Are you sure this will work?
I'm afraid I'll be tied up all afternoon.
I know you can hear me.
You seemed to be willing to do that.
Tom told Mary that he thought she was doing it wrong, but she didn't care what he thought.
The doctor is not available now.
Football players make a lot of money.
Tom's a first-time offender.
I promise you that it won't happen.
Tom said that Mary thought he might need to do that.
Tom said he would never try to do that again.
I don't think it's ever worked.
Don’t forget to take your medicine.
You don't know how hard it was for Tom.
Tom gave me a lot of things.
I know Tom is a few years older than Mary.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that.
I know Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom admitted that he lied to me.
Tom and Mary have told John they don't plan to stay home all day.
Tom doesn't know I still have this.
We're not quite sure exactly what we're supposed to be doing.
We both love Tom.
Tom said he hopes you try your best to do that.
I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do what everyone else wanted to do.
Tom said Mary knew that she might be allowed to do that evening.
I don't think I know the man who's playing the drums.
This old man has liver spots on his skin.
Tom and Mary vowed they would never do that.
Give me that candle.
Tom didn't seem aware of what he needed to do.
There's no time to explain.
Tom didn't realize he had to leave.
They said they were afraid.
Tom and Mary say they can't find their hats.
I graduated from the University of Kyoto.
You're comparing apples and oranges!
Tom said there was still a lot of work to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was embarrassed.
Tom said he thought he would be arrested.
Tom and Mary told me they were wore out.
I have heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Australia.
Tom said he didn't want to see Mary anymore.
They live in a fantasy world.
They said they thought I was charming.
I didn't know Tom was in the hospital.
I don't think you'll have a lot of fun doing that.
I suspect Tom doesn't do that as often as he used to do.
I was surprised that Tom didn't know how to do that.
I plan to skip lunch.
I knew Tom would show you how to do that if you asked him to.
Tom told me he thought Mary was afraid.
Tom already told me he decided to go to Boston next summer.
That doesn't make sense.
They say they're dying.
Tom offered to borrow me some money.
Do you think Tom would let me do that?
Tom had no idea that Mary didn't know what she was doing.
Tom told everyone that he needed to do that.
I don't think Tom is a French speaker.
They said they weren't planning to go.
They say they have taught French.
I suspect Tom and Mary are curious.
I know that Tom knows that I don't need to do that.
You have to help Tom.
Tom told us that he had a headache.
The bomb was depleted just minutes before it would have exploded.
Tom and Mary told me they would win, but they didn't.
I'm glad to hear it!
Tom and Mary say they don't know any French.
I don't think we'll find anyone who can help us do that.
You should have refused to go to Boston.
I thought you didn't approve of Tom dating Mary.
Tom said that isn't the main reason why Mary should do this.
Tom doesn't have a car and neither does Mary.
I'm a cat.
I know you don't do that anymore.
Tom said he wasn't different.
Tom admitted what he said was wrong.
Tom could've been afraid.
Who do you think asked me to give this to you?
I've just been sick.
I hope I'll get up.
Tom said he didn't think we should even consider doing that.
Tom said he would have come if we had invited him.
I don't think I'll probably do that.
Tom said he might cry.
It's Sunday.
Tom told me he wasn't tired.
I didn't think anyone really thought Tom was busy.
I think you know we have to do this today.
I didn't think Tom would actually do that.
I knew Tom would leave early.
Tom said that he thought Mary understood French.
Tom said he needed my help, so I helped him.
I don't think anyone lived in this house in a long time.
Tom denied that he stole the money.
Tom said he hasn't decided what he'll do yet.
Everyone knew Tom didn't like going to Boston.
Tom said he thought tomorrow would be a sunny day.
Tom is obviously drunk.
I'm absolutely sure that's not gonna happen.
Everyone was there except Tom.
I thought you promised to give it to Tom.
I thought you said you saw Tom this morning.
I think Tom was supposed to be here.
Tom and Mary said they had recovered completely.
I didn't know you weren't planning on doing that yourself.
I don't think there's any way out of here.
There is no rose without a thorn.
Tom thought Mary probably didn't know that John spoke French.
You know I wouldn't do that.
I think we all know that it's a bad idea.
I thought Tom knew what Mary had to do.
Tom was probably about 13 years old at the time.
Tom and Mary said they were tickled.
Tom said he wouldn't be able to help the garden weed today.
I wonder how Tom knew I would be here.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who wanted to do that.
I'm not sure Tom would let me do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was mean.
So, where's the problem?
Tom didn't think Mary was beautiful.
He will have to do that task again.
I know Tom didn't know anyone who was able to do that.
Only fresh veg is sold here.
I believe this isn't a good idea.
Tom has already been asked not to do so.
Here's your change.
That portrait reminds me of someone I knew a long time ago.
When was the last time you asked someone for help?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Tom told me he thought Mary was skinny.
I know that Tom is irritated.
I haven't met anyone new today.
This lake is the deepest in Japan.
I knew Tom was planning to do that.
Tom and I don't both speak French.
I thought you'd be ready.
I know that Tom knew why Mary didn't like to do that.
I didn't think that Tom was happy that it had happened.
They said they were very tired.
You're not old enough to get a driver's license, are you?
I don't think there's any harm in telling you now.
I thought you said you did that Monday.
Everyone here knows Tom is in Boston.
Tom denied to meet Mary last week.
That's not why I'm here.
Austria is a parliamentary Republic in mid-Europe and consists of nine Bundesländer.
Tom and Mary are looking for someone to help them build a wall.
They said they're not thirty yet.
I didn't think Tom really needed to do that yesterday.
I thought Tom was already back.
Tom said Mary knew that she might not be allowed to do so unless John did it with her.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were happy.
Tom said that Mary thought that John might be required to do so.
Tom told me he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I thought Mary was cute.
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to do that by herself.
Tom said he thought Mary was happy.
Did Tom say he stayed in Australia?
Tom said he'd pay for everything.
They told me they weren't alone.
I don't think I can finish the job alone.
Tom said Mary is not safe.
Tom said I looked thinner than last time he saw me.
They said they'd see me tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was concerned.
I'm afraid Tom won't let me go.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's gonna do this afternoon.
Tom paid someone to do that.
I thought Tom would be cooperative.
Tom told me he was safe.
Tom said I should go to Boston with you.
They think they know what to do.
Tom thinks Mary will be scared.
Tom and I are both very proud of you.
I knew Tom would show Mary how to do that if she asked him to.
We can't pretend Tom is normal.
Tom's amused.
Tom should never have tried to do that alone.
Tom and Mary said they would never do that.
I'm longer than him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conservative.
Tom said he thought Mary probably wouldn't want to do that on a cold day like today.
The teacher's room and the gym are under renovation.
Do you think there's any chance you'll be able to do that?
Tom set his glass.
You'd think that would have impressed Tom.
This is the first time I bought a newspaper in this city.
That's a good question.
Without water, we cannot exist.
Tom certainly understands that we all need to attend today's meeting.
Tom and Mary say they didn't agree to do that.
I know that Tom will be able to help us do that.
I had lunch three hours ago.
Tom said he appreciated Mary's help.
I knew Tom would forgive me.
You're the only one who can protect them.
Can anyone explain this to me?
Did you know that Tom was gonna be in Boston all week?
Tom and Mary told me they wanted a dog.
Everyone knows that Tom and Mary are like each other.
I know that Tom didn't know that I wasn't gonna do that.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom has a lot of things he needs to do.
Tom and Mary say they're not sure they're ready.
There is no reason for this.
I suspected Tom was intoxicated.
I hope I gave you enough money to buy everything you need.
Tom said he didn't think Mary enjoyed doing that.
They said they were feeling good.
I wish you didn't see me doing that.
Tom and Mary said they had no money.
I don't think I need to tell Tom to do that.
Tom should never have gotten that job.
Tom told Mary that she was his only one.
Tom knew he wouldn't be expelled.
Tom was convinced that Mary did not want to do that.
Tom said he knew that it was what Mary had to do.
I think you're wonderful.
I wonder if Tom is going to Boston next week.
Tom says he didn't know that Mary wouldn't go to Australia unless he went with her.

You're not an idiot.

Tom said he knew Mary would win the race.
I know Tom came to Australia last week.
Tom said Mary wasn't mad.
I think we bought everything we needed.

Tom's hiding something, and Mary knows it.
I think Tom is average.
You're not just working for Tom.
Tom said that he knew that Mary might be required to do so by herself.
I don't think Tom knows how it happened.
It's not a watch.
Tom and Mary said they were not safe.
I'm from the United States.
I don't think Tom knows how to have a good time.
I know you don't want to hurt me.
Tom seems to be willing to correct his mistakes.
I loved that book!
Tom said Mary wouldn't like to do that.
Tom said he felt safe.
Tom is homeick.
Did you know that would happen?
I think Tom believed me.
I don't think we can do that by 2:30.
Tom thinks Mary would probably not do that.
I thought you said we weren't gonna do that anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know anyone who can do that.
I'm pretty sure Tom has a girlfriend.
I thought you might be the only person to listen to me.
I know that Tom didn't know Mary didn't do that.
Tom said he thought Mary would be nervous to do that.
That's the guitar I want to buy.
I think Tom did it.
See you tomorrow morning!
They told me they were ambidextrous.
I know that Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't have to do that.
I really thought Tom would change his mind.
Tom would have missed the train if he had stopped buying a chocolate bar.
I seriously doubt that Tom will be excited about that.
I didn't know that I was supposed to help Tom do that.
No matter what you say, I'm convinced that I'm right.
Tom said he didn't need any more help.
We cannot make a change in our schedule.
I was shocked when I heard that Tom had been arrested.
Tom and Mary probably don't know they're not supposed to park there.
I thought you could use a friend.
You're not really gonna kill Tom, are you?
They said they would be willing to help us.
Tom told me he did that.
Tom is not the same as he was thirty years ago.
I don't think there's any point in discussing this today.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary she needs to do that today.
America's Civil War lasted four years.
They say they're disappointed.
It is not always easy to distinguish between right and wrong.
Tom said he's gonna try something he never did before.
I don't think Tom is strong.
It's not too hard.
Tom said you didn't want to go to Boston with us.
I suspect Tom and Mary are suspicious.
You're a prudent.
Tom said he would have done that if he could.
I don't think anyone really wants to do that.
Tom said he wanted to kiss Mary a good night.
If you do, I will.
I think Tom is irreplaceable.
They told me they were tempted to do that.
I don't think I have everything I need.
That's not what Tom wanted you to do.
What book did you give to Tom?
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last year.
Tom and Mary say they hope they can do that.
I know Tom expected me to do that.
I wonder if Tom has ever been to Boston.
It's not quite finished.
Tom said he felt frustrated.
I know Tom will do that with Mary.
I sent Mary some roses.
Tom said that Mary was older than her sister.
I wasn't as hungry as Tom.
Will you lend me your dictionary?
I buy things I know I'm not gonna use.
Tom claims he didn't kill anyone.
Tom and Mary said that they were very grateful.
How are you doing today?
Tom said Mary wanted to do that yesterday.
Tom told me he wasn't gonna do that.
I know that Tom is a lot stronger than I am.
It was not a easy decision.
I wonder if I can still do that.
I knew Tom didn't want me to do that.
Tom didn't tell anyone anything.
It's Tom's threetieth birthday tomorrow.
Tom said he didn't think that Mary really did what John said she did.
Tom and Mary said they were Canadian.
They hoped they would be able to win.
Tom said that he was happy that Mary could do that.
I should have told you everything earlier.
I thought you had another reason.
I think you shouldn't have bought that car.
Tom told Mary that he was willing to do so.
I should've known Tom would be busy.
Tom told me he thought Mary was thirty.
Tom said he heard someone screaming.
Tom told me that he thought Mary had to do this.
Tom thought I didn't have to do that.
No one asked for your help.
I thought Tom did that yesterday.
Tom was not allowed to board the plane because he did not hold a valid travel document.
Something's not right.
Tom believes Mary's trying to discredit him.
Tom didn't look too angry.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't through yet.
I think Tom won't be early.
Tom told me Mary was nervous.
Samurai lived by a code of honor.
I know Tom doesn't know when I did that.
Tom said Mary was here before.
I can't believe Tom actually did that.
I don't think I bought everything I need.
Tom said he had nothing to do.
I should have noticed it before.
I thought Tom was gonna ask Mary not to do that.
I wonder if Tom wanted to do that.
Tom said he thought we might have a problem.
It rained for three days straight.
Tom thought Mary was pregnant.
When was Tom first doing that?
Do you know if Tom and Mary are allowed to do this?
We told everyone that we were moving to Australia.
Please do that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
I don't think Tom is married anymore.
Tom said he thought Mary would be alone.
Everyone knows Tom and I don't like each other.
I'll see you tomorrow.
They say they were hungry.
Tom said he should have done that.
Tom was extinguished.
Tom said he thought Mary had already finished doing this.
Tom told me he thought he might be able to do that.
I suspect Tom is still in love with his ex-wife.
I know that Tom knew that Mary was the one who had to do this.
Tom rarely waits for anyone.
I just assumed that everyone was going to do that.
I don't think you understand what this means.
It's not possible.
I don't think you have the guts.
I've been busy since yesterday.
Tom said I shouldn't have tried to do that by myself.
Tom said he wished he hadn't tried to do that.
Tom was the one who told me that I needed to do that.
I didn't think we could get home by 2:30.
Tom said he couldn't sleep last night.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was a creative one.
Tom could have come yesterday, but he didn't.
I didn't know that Tom didn't want to do that alone.
Tom thinks he's better than anyone else.
I wonder if Tom was able to do this by himself.
Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't done it.
I suspect Tom will probably have to do that.
You know I'm not good with secrets.
I'm not as busy now as I was this time last year.
I would have spoken to Tom instead of just ignoring him.
I thought you'd want to meet my family.
I don't think Tom will be disobedient.
Tom said he was gonna do that every day after he retired.
There's not much I can do to help, I'm afraid.
Tom and Mary are not yet married.
I know that Tom knew that Mary couldn't do that.
We are at school together.

Tom gave me all the money I asked for.

I thought it would be clear in the afternoon.

Tom and Mary told me they enjoyed the piano.
I know I shouldn't have done that, but I did it anyway.

Tom must've thought Mary could speak French.
He's a very affectionate father.
How did Tom know Mary would do that?
Tom told me he was in a lot of trouble.
Tom thinks it'll rain tomorrow.
I didn't know Tom had a gun.
I thought there was a good chance Tom would want to do that.

It's not gonna be as hard to do as you think it will be.

Are you over 18?
Tom won't leave his children here with us.
Tom didn't realize that we wanted to do that.

Tom said he doesn't think it's necessary to do that.
Tom said Mary is not sure whether John wants to do that or not.
I thought things would get better.
I hope Tom and Mary aren't faster at doing this than me.
Tom said he's glad you're back.
Tom said he thought Mary was unlikely to do that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was conceited.
The way you're planning to do this is dangerous.
You should have come sooner.
I think Tom is strong.
Tom and Mary didn't know that they were supposed to be here yesterday.
I seriously doubt Tom will be there.
Tom said he was really happy that he moved to Australia.
I know Tom is a forest ranger.
It'll be hard for Tom to do that.
They said they'd only talk to you.
French is her mother tongue.
I don't think Tom should do that alone.
Tom picked up his bag and left.
I'm not the only one here who is not married.
Tom said that he knew he might not have to do that again.
They know that they should do so today.
You should have been a lawyer.
I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't know I'm here.
I don't think I need to wear a link to the party.
I don't think there's no reason Tom has to do that.
Tom said Mary would still be pessimistic.
I don't think I could do that even if I tried.
I know that Tom hasn't yet asked Mary to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was talented.
I don't think that doing that is a very good idea.
I'm afraid Tom may not do what he's supposed to do.

Tom told me he'd drive Mary to the airport.

I think this is the first time Tom did that.
Tom hoped he would not be punished.
I know Tom is a very rich man.
Tom must have been home at that time.
I don't think I'm gonna like being here.
There's no hope.
Tom could have gone camping with you if you let him know you were going.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary kept doing that even though he would have asked her not to.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was still interested in doing so.
Are you good at reading maps?
Tom says Mary lies a lot.
I doubt Tom will ever do that.
I think Tom is probably a pretty good lawyer.
I thought I could do that without any help.

Safety is not guaranteed.
Tom did not offer help.
I think Tom will be true.
I assumed Tom had told you I'd be here.
Did you know I was gonna be arrested?
She is a disgusting human being.
Tom already intends to do that.
Take off your school uniform.
I suspect Tom will have to help Mary do that.
I'm afraid I can't.
I know that Tom is almost as long as you are.
The first time I met Tom, he was only 13 years old.
Tom says Australia is his favorite country.
I suspect Tom has never done that.
I thought we could help.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Australia when he was a child?
I'd like to stay longer.
Tom plans to do that today.
You're the same age as I am.
Tom and Mary say this will be the last time they try to do that.
Can you tell me who's coming tonight?
Tom said he wanted to give Mary flowers.
They said they had a garment.

What is the time now?
Tom said things went well.

I doubt we'll be able to prove that.
I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom couldn't speak French.
Tom was surprised that no one else was there.

This is the first time I've ever eaten in an Italian Pizzeria.
Tom said he couldn't clean the pool tomorrow afternoon.

I thought you said nobody would be here.
Tom thinks Mary is pushy.
I'm cute.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Tom drank less than Mary did.
Tom said that he assumed that Mary would want to do that.
One cannot do a lot of things at the same time.
I can't remember her name.
The father works.
Tom and Mary say they're not afraid.
I'll save you a piece of pie.
I thought I was going to be asked to give a speech.
It is a privilege to meet you.
Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him that she had to do this.
Tom said he thought you could help us today.
I'm used to stay up late.
I thought Tom looked happy.
Tom said Mary should do that somewhere else.
No one seemed to want to do that.
Tom said that he knew that he might not be required to do so by himself.
No one told you about the meeting, did they?

I think Tom was supposed to be here by now.
I know Tom and Mary are divorced.
Tom must have seen us.
I know that Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to be doing that here.
I know that Tom was going to do that in Australia last month.
Tom has no reason to do so.
Mary told me that she thought Tom was beautiful.
I didn't know you'd be jealous.
I think both Tom and Mary want something to eat.
They said they didn't mind doing that.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
I think Tom wants you to do that.
Tom said I was the one who should tell Mary that she shouldn't do that here.
Tom and Mary said they're not sick.
I knew Tom should do that outside.
I wonder if I should do that.

I know exactly where I'm going.

What's your last name?
Tom told me he thought Mary had left.

I know that Tom knows that Mary rarely does that anymore.
You're brave than me.
Tom said he was getting drowsy.
They said they tried to do that once.
Tom said that he thought Mary would be in Australia for three weeks.
I should have told Tom not to believe what Mary says.
It would have been interesting to do so.
If you had told me earlier, I would have dressed up.
I think Tom is scared.
Tom said he's sure Mary can swim.
What's her problem?
I think Tom is focused.
I am not interested in this.
I thought the police were looking for Tom.
Why is everyone staring at me?
Tom has everything he needs.
They view foreigners as suspicious; I view everyone as suspicious.
I don't think I can do that better than you.
You could have let me know you're gonna be late.
Tom's delirious.
Willingness to correct is a sign of wisdom.
Tom would never do that.
I don't think anyone else wants to do that today.
It's not as humid today as it was yesterday.
If I had known how to do it, I would have done it myself.
Tom repaired his bicycle.
You're not really planning on taking pictures, are you?
He's two years younger than I.
Tom and Mary told me that they were frustrated.
I didn't know Tom had to do that anymore.
I thought you said you saw people doing that.
It's obvious Tom's waiting for someone.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
Tom said he's reluctant to do that for us.
Give it back!
Tom said he thought Mary could help us today.
I thought the concert went pretty well.
I can't cook at all.
I thought Tom knew what we needed to do.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
I don't think anyone saw us do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might be able to win.
I wonder if Tom has another one.
Everyone except Tom seemed to have fun.
Tom said he needed money so he could buy something to eat.
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary did that.
I knew Tom was done doing that.
I'm not sure that's possible.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Australia with me.
I thought Tom was still in school.
I knew Tom would be the next one to do that.
They'll be glad they didn't do that.
They say they'll buy that for you.

Tom is willing to go by himself.
I know Tom didn't have to do that with us.
Everyone agrees that it was the right decision.
Tom got out of the bath and put his clothes on.

I don't think Tom did what you said he did.
I don't think Tom knows everyone's name.
I don't think it'll be difficult for Tom to do that.

I wish I could visit Australia.
She's eating.
He's the love of my life.
I think Tom is a good painter.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's doing for dinner.
It wasn't that hard to find a pair of shoes that fit.
I would never have let Tom do that.
I promised Tom that I would go to Australia with him.
Tom sings better than me.
Tom said he had a difficult day.
Do you feel like going swimming?
Tom and Mary still hope they can win.
Tom knows we can't win.
I don't think I could do that.
You're to blame.
I thought you said your car was stolen.
I didn't know that Tom would be faster at doing that than Mary.
Tom and Mary both lived in Australia when they were children.
If Tom doesn't do that, I won't either.
Tom told me he thought Mary was funny.
I know that Tom didn't know that Mary should do that.
I wonder if Tom really stayed in Boston last summer.
In his heart, Tom knew that he would never return.
We're not ready to go home yet.
Tom should have eaten more.
I thought Tom was gonna give Mary flowers.
Tom said that Mary thought John might be required to do so in the near future.
I didn't think we had enough food to feed everyone.
I should have listened to what my mother said.
Tom is wasting time.

If this is madness, there is a method in it.
Tom told me everything I needed to know.
They told everyone they were upset.
Tom said he wouldn't do that unless I helped him.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was sincere.
She knows about things like that.
I don't think I've ever heard Tom complain about Mary's cooking.
I suspect Tom and Mary are ready to do that.
What's the name of your pharmacy?
I don't think anyone else wants to come.
I knew Tom was very busy.
Tom said he thought I might not have to do that until October.
What's worrying about you, Tom?
Tom is a traveling seller.
I suspect Tom isn't in Boston anymore.
Tom is convinced that he needs to do this.
This is the first time I visited Australia.
I knew Tom didn't know that he didn't really have to do that.
Everyone knows we killed Tom.
Tom said he would rather not go to Australia with us.
Dinner's not ready yet.
I hope I'll be able to help you tomorrow.
Sure we can do that, but it would be very difficult to do it.
I could have saved Tom's life.
There's a good chance Tom's gonna ask Mary to the dance.
Tom told me that he found an interesting book about Australia in the local library.
I don't think we can take care of ourselves.
Do you need a lift?
I thought I made my reasons clear.
Tom is someone I look up to.
Tom says he's sorry he broke his promise.
I think I just got enough money to buy the computer I want.
I realize that Tom will try to do that.

Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't sleeping.
Tom goes to Boston every chance he gets.
I know Tom never considered doing that.
Didn't you know that I was hoping Tom would do that?
They said they'll call you later.
I promise we'll be listening to everything you say.
I think you'll enjoy it there.
It's not all that ridiculous.
I wonder if we have to do that.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to do that today.
The fuse has blown.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do that.
Tom should have been interested.
I wonder if Tom really wants me to do this today.
It's not good to mock people in public.
We should have planned for this.
I don't think you need to tell Tom why you didn't do that.
They say they have never done that.
Tom and Mary said they wouldn't do that.
I know Tom is connected.
Tom said he needed to spend a few weeks in Australia.
Let's get married.
Get the fuck out of here!
I think Tom was to Boston at least once.
He's leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.
I wasn't as helpful as I should have been.
Tom said that Mary was living in Australia.
They told me they didn't like to study in the morning.
You tricked me!
We're too busy for that, Tom.
Is this seat empty?
Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary that he forgot to do that.
You're free to go.
I know Tom is confident.
Tom thinks it's pretty good.
Tom said he and Mary had a fight this morning.
Tom may be lying.
I heard Tom live in Australia.
No one told me I wasn't supposed to park there.
Tom could've taken the money.
Tom doubted Mary would keep her promise.
Make sure no one enters.
I doubt that will ever change.

It was clear that Tom was going to do so with Mary.
I suspect Tom is drunk.
I met someone yesterday who knows that we are.
Tom told me he didn't have an insurance.
I hope I can live here with you.
Those agenda items were taken up en bloc for discussion.
Tom said he felt good about that.
I suspect that Tom and Mary know something interesting is about to happen.
You know I need to do that, don't you?
They must have found out who I was.
I don't think I passed the test.
I knew Tom was a bad loser.
I don't think Tom is dead.
They said they didn't feel anything.

When she came to the place where the footpath led through the moor, she found small pools of water, and a great multitude of mud, so she threw the loaf into the mud, and trodden it on it, that she might pass without threshing her feet.
