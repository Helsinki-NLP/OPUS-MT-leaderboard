You were very quiet.
You convinced me.
You have a little hot today, right?
You have to raise your voice.
You're shot.
You found the right enemy.
You won!
Wait, thank you!
You wanted to tell me about freedom?
You want to hit?
You want to watch a French movie, right?
You figured 70 pounds.
You'll be advised.
You focused.
You were mine.
You were my life.
You've never been like him.
You're not being questioned today, are you?
You weren't jealous.
You weren't jealous.
You're happy to argue that this trial has been deleted, right?
They told you to let go.
You were Tom's only friend.
Be a good diplomat.
You won't even know I'm there.
You'll talk to such a disturbing person for nothing.
You won't get there in time.
You're not gonna tell them, are you?
You won.
You win.
You won?
Would you do that for me?
You'll never understand.
You yourself don't know what you're talking about.
You'll use this camera tomorrow afternoon.
