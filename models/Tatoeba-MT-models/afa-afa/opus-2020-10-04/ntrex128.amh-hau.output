● John Edward: Language skills are useful for international citizens.
In Scutland, private schools in Scutland have made it possible to make the most most of the most successful in 20182018, with the presecure of the results of school schools in Scotland, with the most successful success, because of a strong work of sports, sports, art, music, music, and other social sports, and social and social.
At the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, where there are over 30,000 students, the Schools of Scottish Schools of Independent Schools have been represented by the schooling of its homes to give the students and parents a very good service.
The private schools are working with the aim of a career and place of work for the future high-level education of their students as citizens.
Ö such as a system of education, such as a editor and a editor, modern languages, including their fame, have been selected in schools.
According to Nelson Mandala, “let him be able to understand the time when you speak with the speaker of the language.
And when you talk with the speaker, let him have some insight.
It should be of great interest to note with the great great sense that we should not be merely English English alone should not be based on English.
In private schools, the results of this year have been seen as high the basis of languages in the Belgian Scenario.
Of the students, 68 percent of the students have brought us up in foreign languages — A.
According to the data collected from the SCIS and 74 member schools, 72 percent of Mandarin, 69 percent French, and 63 percent of Spanish study, reported on a high rate of A results, have been reported, as shown by the data collected from the SCIS and 74 members.
This shows that in Sc Scutland, private schools of private schools in Sc Scutlandland, we believe that foreign language languages of foreign foreign languages in Sc Scutland, the benefits for young young children and young young people's future life for their future future.
At present, there is one teaching in private schools and others: languages are the subjects of STEM (science, technology, Engineering, and Histelling).
The study revealed that 1717 percent of the 17 percent of the 17 percent of the ling language problems were the main cause of the ling language problem, for the workers who were unable to fill their smud-on-on-comm UK's worker wall walls for the worker's workforforthe UK's workformale language problem.
Therefore, many young people and many linguistic skills are very useful for their future working life.
In the world of Luli, language skills are useful for most of the workforces.
It is not as the one who has chosen a field of work, but a second-lan, a second-lan, a second language that is learning a second language, which is a second-lan and a second-second-lan-lan-long-long-long-long-long-long--long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-- and, and the , and the two----- and------------
*People who speak many languages to communicate directly with foreign nationals overseas win the game.
For example, according to Jugov’s choice in 2013, more than 4000 young people of the Kingdom of Yunit are unable to speak 75 percent of foreign languages in order to communicate with others, and the French percent is the only language (15%) spoken in two countries.
This is why it is important to spend money on teaching children in the language of today's children's language.
To be able to have a lot of languages in many languages, especially the growing economics, especially their economy, will create for children, children who are growing up with a growing economy and children, a long-- and more meaningful work, with a further meaningful and meaningful work.
In Scotland, there is a difference in the language of each school.
The many schools of many schools in more modern languages, and others such as Mandarin or Japan, such as Mandarin or Japan, teach by thinking about the future time after 202020, that the U. U. U.S.A. is very useful.
The share of the children’s desire and the ability to learn the languages they wish to learn in private schools is also supported by experts who have done so in the Spepshashalisd.
In Scotland private schools are working to prepare children to succeed in the future and to create an area of education that will enable them to succeed.
In the world’s world’s Beizens region, language is very useful for the future of the countries, so it should not be forgotten that it should be included in education at this time.
Indeed, modern languages should pay attention to the “environmental skills” of the world.
The private schools continue to provide the young Scotlands with the choice of choices and escalation for the young Scotlands.

He said that it was difficult to find the same person of age who went to the first Olympic at the age of 14 and his father from the age of the age of three to the age of the age of three who died of cancer - who had spent the same infectious emergencies.

He says, “If you had asked me last year, I would only have wanted gold medals.”
"You know, there are bigger things than the gold of Olympic Media.
My medal of Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son, as his father, Robert, died of cancer in the brain in 2011 at 40 years of age, a similar name.
Daley refused to accept his father’s death, and he said that one of the things he asked him about the death of his father, and finally one of the questions he asked him -- because he wanted to be a front-side-- he had their tickets for London 2012.
He said, "I couldn't tell my father that I wouldn't have to tell you that we would not have a good one to be left over."
He said: “When the breath was cut off, he held his hand in his hand, and I confirmed that the breath was not until the breath was standing and that it was not until death, and that it was not until the breath was standing, and that it was not until death, and that there was never the last of it.”
By the following evening, Daley overcame the 2010 Olympics and defeated copper.
"But if this age of mine had been used to send me, I knew that I -- I knew that in front of the supportive people, there is no desirable feeling in the Olympic Games," he said.
