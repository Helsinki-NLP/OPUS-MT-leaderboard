It is difficult to study traffic contamination, since it cannot be predicted as if it were not being done.
As a lot, drivers tend to behave in an appropriately rigid territory, so traffic congestion has a measure of proportionality, and they can represent mathematics.
In order to better represent traffic flows, contacts have been established between the three main features, (1) leakage, (2) repair, and (3) speed.
These contacts help to set up road services, disinfect and work.
