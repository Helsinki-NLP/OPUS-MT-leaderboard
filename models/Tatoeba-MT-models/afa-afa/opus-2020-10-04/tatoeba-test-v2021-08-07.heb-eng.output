You're both stupid until you smile.
You two have to be a lot in common.
You used me.
You've been in love with me before, haven't you?
You smoked before, didn't you?
You've fully evaluated the situation.
You were a great crowd.
You're trapped.
You're trapped.
You're trapped.
They picked you up.
You were very good to me.
You were so good to me.
You were so good to me.
You were very quiet.
You convinced me.
You've got a bit of heat today, haven't you?
You have to raise your voice.
You've been shot.
You found the right opponent.
You win!
Thank you!
You wanted to tell me about freedom?
You want a hit?
You want to watch a French movie, right?
You figured 70 pounds.
You'll be advised.
You focused.
You were mine.
You were my life.
You've never been like him.
You're not questioning today, are you?
You weren't jealous.
You weren't jealous.
You're glad to argue that this trial has been deleted, right?
They told you to let go.
You were Tom's only friend.
Be a good diplomat.
You won't even know I'm there.
Falsely talk to such a disturbing person.
You won't get there in time.
You're not gonna tell them, are you?
You won.
You win.
You won?
Would you do that for me?
You'll never understand.
You yourself don't know what you're talking about.
You'll use this camera tomorrow afternoon.
