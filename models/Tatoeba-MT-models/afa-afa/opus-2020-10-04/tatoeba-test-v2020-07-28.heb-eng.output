Have you had a nice weekend?
Am I stupid?
She was depressed because of all her problems.
Are meals included in price?
Because the rain ceased to travel.
The doctor knew how to deal with such an emergency.
The temperature's down ten degrees.
I know this neighborhood.
She responded to a request for a visa.
I thought everything was over.
It's dangerous to swim at night.
It's just like fighting spirit security.
I don't care about the risk.
It's the weather forecast time.
It looks tough.
That man's dangerous.
She cooked us a wonderful meal.
He was a soldier during the war.
I'm on the sea language.
It was my first thought.
We don't blame you.
We can't live without sleep as we can't live without food.
Someone just ringed.
They knew better days.
He's alive here.
If you don't hurry, you'll never get to the village.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I missed it.
It's all up to your decision.
You're sweaty.
He was mingled with thoughts, his hand backed in his forehead.
There's nothing to say.
Look, here he comes.
She was really cold.
It's on my job list.
Be careful not to fall to the knee.
I gave it to my mom.
Stop wasting time.
I felt pretty bad.
My hobby is reading.
I'll drink my coffee after dinner.
I don't forgive you.
They don't believe you.
That wasn't supposed to happen.
I don't want to learn tonight.
Tom thinks Mary was wrong.
I always knew that Tom was meant to be great.
It's raining quietly.
Can you send this letter in a quick mail?
Close it.
Tom's not responsible.
Hey, guys, I'm Tom, and I'm here with Mary.
You look beautiful tonight.
We've had problems with the device yesterday.
Tom visited Mary in October 20.
When I got home, I found your letter waiting for me.
They're Russians.
It's simpler than it looks.
She looks to me a serious and reliable person.
Tom Athlete.
He tried.
We can't survive without your help.
I was the one who offered it.
This rum isn't as good as his last.
They stayed in this way for a while.
This path is dangerous.
Can you show me the way to the library?
I stayed home all day and read books.
That's my decision.
It's okay.
I made him go.
You invite him to come watch a movie.
Tom was disgusted.
Don't you call me death.
I know exactly how you feel.
I met Tom in January.
They got a joint decision about divorce.
Stop announcing me.
Today I'm in the mood of my mind.
It doesn't happen much.
We're planning to visit Mr. Smith tomorrow.
He has a comfortable nature.
I don't want to leave this place forever.
My son is my biggest headache.
Sit down, please!
I can't drive the car, I don't have a driving license.
She invited each of us to ice cream.
She was playing the play.
Tom told me he didn't see Mary all day.
I don't like being alone on the beach.
I'm never planning anything.
You got a map?
Tom was sweating.
Do I need to sell it?
They're calling with handprints.
Maybe we should ask someone for help.
I'm hungry.
That's hard to read.
I've been nervous for a week, and I haven't recovered yet.
We started going again right after she recovered.
Is there an English-Japanese hotel on the shelf?
The gun's stuck.
We're too few now.
We have to stay on the stand.
What's Tom's problem at all?
They were born with a child.
Tom looks upset.
Maybe Tom's telling the truth.
For civilization, there is now a threat of a nuclear war.
I often have nightmares.
The company decided to hire two new secretaries.
Please give me a pillow.
Tom almost killed both of them.
I wanted to watch this movie with you.
Come at least six.
I'm delivering your clue.
It's very intuitive.
I'll get it back right away.
Tom and Mary are miserable too.
What group does your friend have?
Just Tom stays.
Sit down, please.
Tom decided to stay back.
Shut up, please.
Do you like what you see?
Give me a second chance.
It's natural.
Don't ever write the words "Mark Latter" and "Merc Rob" in German!
It's a violent neighborhood.
Wonder what you can learn a week.
There are animals that can feel a close storm.
How can I ever forgive Tom?
This house seems abandoned.
This is the perfect place for Marve.
Counsel with the doctor.
I'm jealous.
These are my friends.
She's in love with this kid.
Tom didn't finish all his homework.
How do you know about Tom?
You sound like a child.
I know you'd do the same to me.
By the end of the years, they put their colors down.
Tom never admits wrongly, because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
That's how I like it.
She's a confessor who didn't meet Maria.
It's the other river along Japan.
Nobody's happy.
Finally, I don't owe anybody.
Tom spoke unkindly.
He's married and father to two.
There could have been a failure in answer.
He blows the bike every week.
Don't turn off the computer.
From this distance you can't notice it anymore.
She received guidance from her former doctor and was transferred to another hospital.
I was missing a screw.
My best friend speaks Irish.
It's more complicated than I thought at first.
I don't know anything about him.
I was just drinking a few beers.
The man who hits the car is Mr. Jones.
I owe my boyfriend.
I stayed calm.
She likes to try new things.
I heard him sniffing.
Move to the next page.
Did you become an angel?
I hope it can happen now.
Materials will be satisfied.
Did I touch an exposed nerve?
There are many places of life in big cities.
The first blow is half the battle.
I'm not sure of it, though.
I've really seen a ghost.
Did you recover from the shock?
Tell Tom I'm going on a trip.
Everything's on the head.
You know where she lives?
Tom and Mary are probably going to marry one day.
Their house was fired.
I like this picture.
Grab a nap.
Eventually, his dream came true.
I worked very hard.
Not that he died.
She didn't come up to answer the question.
The oranges are rich in Vietamine C.
I'm sure Tom told you I'd be here.
This method has benefits and shortages.
He hid the fact that he dragged his wife.
Shut your big mouth.
Tom told Mary about his new car.
Who made the dynamite?
The great love of my life.
Perfect experience.
Where's your money?
Tom asked Mary to sing stronger.
Sorry, I can't stay long.
I don't know if it's upstairs.
Where's the toothpaste?
Let's get something cold to drink.
These are my books.
I want a guitar like John's.
It won't bother us if you take a picture from the outside.
The purpose is to cleanse the means.
Looks like you have a lot of knowledge about it.
Are you the supporters or those who resist the fall?
Please don't interfere with it.
Long Time No. C.
Today I'm not gonna get e-mail from anybody.
I waited for you.
Cat Kimer's back.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Tom is from Boston.
You want to know how I did it?
I can't find the paper.
I'm learning one language.
This microscope grows by a hundred.
He's in debt.
Tom's a bell.
Tom's not the one who left the party early.
Speaking English in Canada?
That's really impressive!
We wanted dessert.
Tom didn't get up early enough.
Hello, how can I help you?
Tom led his gun to the target.
I believe my friends make me rats.
You'd better leave.
Donald Trap is suffering from Madmancia.
Please don't ask.
I'm coming to kill you.
I like the time between the evenings.
You should go.
You ready to go out?
I know how it must sound.
Can anyone help me here?
Where'd Tom put you in the house of jail?
I learned from the best.
Don't hurry to protect me.
I just know that.
Don't miss me again.
Area in building: helmets have to be used.
It's Tom's locker.
I'm sure I'm not going to recommend Tom for the job.
You should try not to forget what time.
Will you go to the United States next year?
Think about your future.
As far as I am concerned, I don't trust him at all.
I don't know what to say.
It rained yesterday.
She got caught with her pants downstairs.
I know maybe you think I'm too young.
I can't help him.
It didn't go that far.
How's everybody feeling?
We're supposed to be safe here.
Did you eat breakfast today?
There's a bridge three miles up the river.
Tom offered Mary not to do that.
I know you think there's no hope.
The judges have made a decision.
It's hard to learn Greek?
He's going to the library to read books.
They're animals in this city.
The sky will be cleared up soon.
I didn't like Tom.
We're trying to learn here.
Please, take this dog puppy.
It's impossible to provide it.
Get back to your chair.
She chose a hat to fit her new dress.
I spent the last Sunday down at home.
Let's not do anything that might upset Tom.
I'm missing money.
I'll finish reading that novel soon.
Tom doesn't seem interested in what's happening.
I don't want you to meet my daughter anymore.
You're not going out there.
Tom drinks about three liters of water a day.
We never agree.
We were glad we were alive.
Some newspapers have blinded the news.
Sign it, please.
This is my car.
I'd love to see that.
This pen is the best.
Heroes advocacy is a dangerous matter.
Tom says he doesn't want to suck more about this.
White paper.
Drinks are half a price to six.
The sky is bright almost every day.
Well, I lied.
Whatever you do, don't come up with complaints for it.
Paris is very magical to Japanese young people.
This bridge is three times as long as it is.
I tried not to eat too much.
Tom looks desperate.
They slept in the same bed.
His success depends on his efforts.
I've got quite a lot of hats.
The residents of their homes along the river.
It was impossible to pull out the pocket.
Today was thrilling.
I'm on it.
Just the vital adjustments, please.
Salt, please.
Did you decide where to eat lunch?
I changed my theory.
She was kind enough to pick me up from home.
I ran.
Tom's an account manager.
Raise your left hand.
I'm doubting the rightness of his statement.
I think they got into some kind of problem.
This movie's boring.
Where to go and see, my main concerns were.
My longest romantic relationship lasted four months.
She never told me yet.
Tom's an old hat that he's always wearing in the rain.
