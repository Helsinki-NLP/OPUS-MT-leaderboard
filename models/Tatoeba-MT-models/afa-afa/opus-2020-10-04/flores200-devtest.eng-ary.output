* Out of the savanna, it’s difficult for a primate with a diesel system like that of humans to meet its amino-acid requirements from the resources available for plants.
Besides, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, u eventwalment death.
For the most accessible resources available on plantation would be proteins accessible in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to dig unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, the foods of animals (nants, teraphims, eggs) are not only depreciable but also provvedi proteins ta’ kwalità għolja li fihom all the essential amino acids.
For everything considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors have solved the “problem of protein” their “problem” in a somewhat similar way today, even as the shampoos on the savanna do.

* Flow of traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Fortunately, study of traffic flows is difficult because behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a range reasonablely consistent; therefore, streams of traffic tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented virtually matematikaly.
● To better represent the flow of traffic, ġew stabbiliti relazzjonijiet بين the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
● These relationships help to plan, design, and operations facilities on the road.
