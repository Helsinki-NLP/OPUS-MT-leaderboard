Hitler wrote in the autobiography 'Mein Koff' that the size of the lie is the main reason for confidence.
People adopt great lies with simplicity than small lies in the primitive simplicity of their minds.
In the early morning, Congressman Devkant Barua had held the principle of 'Indira Iz India'.
But the facts of history are different.
Nation-building has a long history.
It is the people of India who have universally contested the nation from their conscious labour.
For vision and culture, ancestors such as the VedicƒÉ, the Kapil, the Wise, the Great, and the Sanskrit are notable.
The moonlights for ancient national unity are the royal systems of Moravia, Ashok, etc.
There is a large series of great men who clashed with foreign attacks and regimes.
Vivekananda, Mercy, Tilak, Gandhi, Subhash, Patel, Lohya, Vipin Chandra, Ambedkar, etc., is a long list of immortal killers such as Bhija Singh, Chandrasekhar Azad, but all credit for Congressional nationbuilding is just giving the Nehru-Indira family.
Big lies are more effective.
Of the 58 central plans, 16 are the names of the Politicians.
The list of other plans, awards, airfields and institutions with the Nero family is long.
Now the public distribution system i.e. the PDS plan is also being prepared to be added to the name Indira Gandhi.
The names of great men inspire.
The identity of the street, university or airports in their name is of course welcome, but the designation of the international airport of the country's capital from the rural housing plan in the name of the same political family cannot be said to be appropriate in any form.
The public distribution system is already notorious.
Who prevents Congress from asking for a vote in the name of this plan?
But what is the difficulty in taking a look even outside the Nero family at the time of the designation?
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the main dissident group took up the greatness of Narendra Modi's mid-principal Patel from the Prime Minister.
Patel is the great nation maker.
He had connected 562 state units to the nation by his device.
Patels are all, the overalls are dear to India, but Congress just considers them its ends.
The public distribution system can also be named on the panel.
This will make no difference to the importance of the panel.
Congress has long been in power.
The politics of the plans were only carried out by Congress.
Congress was once a democratic group, Tilak, Gokhale, Gandhi, Subhash, Rajendra Prasad, Nehru, Patel, and Madan Mohan Malviy, after 1950 she went under the control of a family.
The party and the family became alternative.
It was only for the family and the country to tell the choice that 'Indira Iz India' was created.
The naming of the plans was also domesticated.
Government plans run from the capital, collected from the country's taxpayers.
The capital of the country is not the endowment of a family of Congress.
Every group of congressmen saw their great-grandmother.
Regional groups carried out plans in the name of manly politicians.
The great men belong to all, but the list of delirious great men grew.
The constituents are their great men of every small group.
Government plans are not carried out in the name of politicians in the United States.
In India, their worth is delicate.
The center claims to have taken direct credit by planning for the Nehru family's name.
Plans called Mahatma Gandhi, Patel, Subhash Chandra Bose, or Bhaji Singh do not connect with the identity of Congress.
Congress has been cut off from its heritage.
The messages or sermons of Rahul-Sonia are the only works of Congress.
Of course other groups also name their plans the same even if they do not run plans in the name of the same family as Congress.
Politicization of plans associated with society welfare is inevitable.
There are paintings of the Sapa chief in Lapatap distributed in the Uttar Pradesh.
Of course, voters give the majority of the received group the right to policy-making.
The government is bound by the planning and the duties of the Qutrianvian, but the MPs and taxpayers do not grant the government the right to the arbitrary naming of the plans.
Prosecutors expect politics not susceptibility from governments, and transparent collective use of taxpayer capital.
Political abuse of capital is constitutional crime.
There's just going to be a behaviorology of naming.
Politicians are not the only drugs of every machine.
India is full of multidimensional representations.
The name of the Institute of Higher Education/Shodh Institute should be in the name of a representative Indian scientist.
The designation of the institution associated with literature, vision, or art will look good in the name of the distinguished literary or visualist.
History in politics is a lack of consciousness.
There was also a long debate over the country's naming at the Constituent Assembly.
Seth Govindas, Kamalapati trilogy etc. emphasized 'India'.
The name India received 38 and India received 51 votes.
The default question is, why does there not be a thorough consideration of the naming of plans?
Why does it lead to politics?
Why does one family have such a principality?
Why don't you make any list center of common folk names?
Joint committees of parliament or assembly may also be used to create a list.
Why is there great unrest at both the center and the state in the naming of plans?
In the course of the same unrest, the younger generation is also forgetting the names of the freedom fighters.
There's a variety of great ones here.
Some of the TV's lyrics and chivalry were colored by political bias.
The designation is know-how.
Only the beginning of knowledge is stated to have a name in the 'knowledge' of the hymn.
Good naming of plans is also motive.
It is the labor instrument to remember the names of larger personalities from the Book of Common Knowledge, but adding government planning, road or important venue to the motivational personality may be the simplest tool of history consciousness.
Many names such as Gandhi City, Patel Airport, Ambedkarpuram or Vivekanandapuram connect with motivational history.
A survey that just two or three months ago stated that the village-city of Rama was connected with half of the country's name.
The designation requires additional awareness of the country, call, culture, civilization and history.
Many names become representative of the fraternity and perspective special.
Mercy, Consciousness, and Gandhi's Names are Orders of Social Change, Paine Vision, and Truth, Options of Violence.
Congressman begs friends to come out of the addiction to finding names in the same family.
Only in the history of India are there many names with gold.
The motor vehicle accident claim judgment has ordered the family of former Maharashtra minister Srikant Zichkar, who was killed in the road crash in 2004, to pay $50.67 million in compensation.
The family had asked for $25.82 million as bail.
The family was said to be the only one to be unaware of the bus driver of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation [MSRTC] had caused Zichkar's death on two June 2004.
The lawsuit said as well as ordering MSRTC to grant bail, the insurance company would not have to pay any fees because the car itself was Zichker's.
Zichkar's lecturer friend Sriram Dwarf's family will also receive $21.60 million in compensation.
Their funeral was also in the same accident.
It will give about 70 percent of the revenue (15.12 million dollars) of MSRTC.
Zichker's car driver will also give the family of the former minister the remaining 30 percent (6.48 million dollars) due to being found guilty of negligence.
He discussed organizational activity from party supporters & members during this time.

This time those in Twin City may have to ban in the light dark.
Those who have not filled the power bill in a set date.
Connection are being cut after 15 days of fixed date.
Subsequent connections to the camp have been cut off from number one, two, and baboons all from the station.
That's why there's a crowd of consumers cutting off electrical connections.
Consumers are upset.
One of the reasons for the trouble is that the power corporation has also stopped taking part pement.
If the scheme is taking part pement, consumers are having to fill 80 to 90 percent of the bill.
In Sub-Saharan Number One, SDO has noted 'Don't be ashamed' by telling Bada not to collect a party pement in his office.
Obeyed by the E.E. of Operation Circle Angola, the power corporation has abandoned the idea of a hago-kram on consumers.
Now they must fill the two-month incoming bill inside the set date, not if the power connection will be cut after 15 days of the final date of filling the corporation bill.
The Angolan Circle, from the North Haryana Power Distribution Corporation, has received about $102 million of a target.
