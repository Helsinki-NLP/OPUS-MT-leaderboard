Black box in your car?
While America's street planer is struggling with a lack of wealth to improve the high system, many people are looking into the small black box, which fits with cleaning at your car's dash.
This device, which tracks every mile run by motorists and transmits information to authorities about the world's leading streets today, has become the subject of a debate effort to repair the world's major streets and state planning offices.
In general, such boring work as high-highway work has become a matter of sudden intense debate and life - threatening interactions.
You've had a detail of the targeted mile, and probably the drive-and-or use of this information to produce tax Bills to support the releasemental environmental groups in favor of allowing the government to use these black box.
The tea party's a fissure.
The American citizen freedom organization is also very concerned with taking a series of different privacy issues.
While Congress could not agree whether to take further action, many Kingdoms are not waiting.
They're searching how they can go in the next decade to a system in which the driver pay for every mile set on the street.
Thousands of motorists have already taken a black box for testing drives, some of which is GP.S. Monitoring.
It's really essential to our country.
"It's not the subject of choosing or choosing by us," says Hussan Igrea, director of the South California government director of the Union, who has been planning to start tracking every mile determined by motorists in California by 2025.
The way we pay off is going to change.
There's technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's high-house property has nearly been suspended, with money paid by U.S. citizens on gas pumps.
The American people don't buy as much gas as they once did.
Now the car goes more than ever in a toast gas.
The Federal tax has had no increase in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per St.
Because of the high price of gas, politicians avoid increasing a money tax.
Transport policy expert taken at the University of Egypt says, "It's not absolutely unlikely."
Their state has recently put tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-fucking system.
They say, "In time it will work as the most logical option."
Vonx says it's Ishmael-based user fees.
It is not surprising that this idea looks good to urban generousists, because it can be changed into changes in processing cars for example, which can help lower drinks and reduce greenhouse gas.
Placeholders of California are eager for this system while they are developing strategy to achieve their goals in state's Global Voices rules.
But the president of the Home Transport Committee, rips. Bill Roster (A.P.A) also takes the black box as the most recent option.
Even the free vendors in the Rehabilitation are in favor of paying hundreds of miles per day by the driver.
He said: "It is not but a deed which is going into the blind well."
People are paid more clearly for what they're getting.
Two former U.S. Transport secretarys have also supported the campaign, who had favored moving from Congress in 2011 in their report.
The U.S.N.N.N.N. check project was accepted last year, including 10,000 cars.
But after working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, representing people who had to walk too many miles to go to work or go to town, the lead of the hall ended the offer there.
Yet many kingdoms and cities themselves are moving forward in this direction.
It has the most willing Orogon, which listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest use.
The driver will pay me a favour, instead of gas the state.
Govade has already finished the initial test.
New York City is even moving in this direction.
Ian this is trying with trucks on limited grounds.
And I95, including 17 state transport departments (myland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Virginia, and Florida), are studying how they can operate this change.
This idea didn't get support in all places.
The drivers were very impatient about how the government could monitor each of their steps, where 50 willing car drivers had previously been put on cars.
The problem of strategy and operation in the Nevago transport department, which directed the strategy and operation management, is said to be “a major problem concerned about Bigther and other kinds of things like that."
It's not what people wanted.
Also, with further testing ahead, Neu's A.L.U. had warned on his website: "It would be much easier to convert these devices to the full tracking device."
There is no need to develop the giant, nuclear technology structure, which every person must normally spread to record the mood-shifting record.
The Govada is one of the many kingdoms that are trying to achieve potential technology, with which the Kingdom can describe how many miles a day the car is running, but not where and where it is going.
Khan said that if you can, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to the small California Startup.
This firm was not basically in business to help state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the auto insurance market, which the drivers had to pay on the basis of their register.
But the device that is testing is good for high plans, because it does not use GP.S and provides much limited information, which is printed by the Modem in due time.
"If you do not track people's pace and their location, then they will be more willing to adopt this way."
These early programs of the Kingdom have made some serious mistakes.
There are also very few costs to do this and ways of low intervention.
In Orgoon, scheme drivers are using different choices.
They can choose the devices of GP.S. application or without the use of GP.S.
Or else you can't select any device, but you can choose to pay a fee on the basis of the average mile you're supposed to set by the citizens of the state.
Other places hope that the device can be sold by concerned citizens by providing less services rather than less.
In New York City, transport officials are attempting to develop a taxing device, including which will enable you to pay a quarter meters (U.S.) of your drive to purchase insurance, and create a collection of actual time data from other drivers who can use the motor-oping traffic to avoid traffic.
The city's planning document is mentioned, "tomo-trainer will be attracted to participation because of the benefits that result from it."
However, some transportation schemes wonder that maybe all the discussion according to a mile is very interesting.
Metropolitical transport commission in the San Francisco Bay said that the Congress could be very easily handled by an increase in gas factory.
There can be a extra time or annual payment on drivers of habeid or other cars whose vehicles don't use too much gas so they can pay their appropriate part.
The director of the commission and director of public affairs, Rydephererer, said, "What is needed for a blood transfusion when it can be done?"
If we do so, millions of car drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.

Ferman Air Forces - Will Pay on On-the-bags · Global Voices
Ferontler's plan to charge $100 for passengers on his plane plane board in Ferner Aires.
And it will pay $2 for coffee or soda, though on Wednesday, to announce that passengers can keep perfect box.
There's pay-on over to the bag, so the little bag under the seat will be still free.
Fertrewer said that $25 would charge if the payment was paid in Addiss, $300 would wait if passengers wait to pay until they're at the gate.
Ferontor's spokesman O'Melli said that there is to get charge of charge at the Adrier's Adlers' Adlers.
"We don't want to charge him," he said.
Air Forces started charge for the first and second check bag in 2008.
The passengers who are trying to avoid charge are filling up as they can in the kitchen - on bag containers that are put in the box box, this means, most of the place in this box is short.
There's a way to lower the passengers on the tax board.
O'Mali said it's not really about making the new charge money.
It's become increasingly difficult to find that Overheed Bin in the more faithful clients.
The passengers who buy tickets in their website don't have to give it to them.
That means that in line the next person could give 100 dollars for a similar bag, whereas a traveler on a front gate can get a bag free.
O'Mali said that the website of Ferterler and checkin's processes are being changed to make sure the passengers know about fees about the fee before they get to the gate.
Feront must not start up to the summer, even though a date is not specified.
Travelers often reveal sanitary about bags and other fees, but the plane service likes them.
They argue that the bag costs to handle, and those who want passengers service should pay for it.
The fees at Wall Street are many a sign that many airline losers are chargeing enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losing.
Most of them, though do not even touch a bag-on-bag.

With such a fee, the other airline is the Wiz of Haifer, who the Airline counselor, said, and who tracks the AD - On%.
He brings money to $50 million a year, estimated in the report in December 2011.
Sorens, an ex official of the Palestinian Aires, recently flew off in Spiriit, and passengers had had to meet an unusual bagman on the gate.
"The keyboarding process I saw in my airline factory was easy," he said.
I was hoping to beat the teeth and see out on a battle gate.
"It was full and he set it up the liy-pet."
Ferroner is also following $2 payment for coffee, tea, Soda, or jurit's.
He said that the passengers who took Soda, or Jus, could put all the box, and give it free coffee only for once.
It'll still give the water away.
U.S. Air Force tried to charge for drinks in 2008 in 2008, but after the passengers complained they turned back seven months later and followed no other main airline.
The passengers of Ferrator's If the airline doesn't buy directly from the airline then the step of Ferontreer to charge a fee on the Internet is his latest attempt to conduct clients to his own website.
Airis pays the online performer sales for the $25 to $25 per sales ticket like this.
That's why all Air Forces have been encouraged to operate passengers instead of going through an online railway agency to buy directly from those people.
However, this area has gone further.
In September most of the time, flights started to give half of the distance to clients who bought from these men from an online railway agency
On Wednesday, it reduced MyIdents to 25 percent of the round rounds.
So, a 1,000 miles away from an online railway agency will earn up to 250 miles.
It also allows them to choose their seat in advance for the only passengers who buys directly from the site.
In Denver, Ferman, there is a faithful base of customers in his home city, but its business is losing the money.
The drop in Rajasta at 9 percent and its flight capacity is reduced to about 13% in the first quarter, according to Wednesday financial consequences, according to St.
The Republic of Airline is trying to determine the financial of Fontler as part of the sales.
NSA. The website has accused "apport error" instead of using KNA to crash the website.
The mysterious national security agency told Friday Friday that because of some technical lack, our website had closed for some hours, not because of the way some claimed online.
The secretary of the secret agency said when sent e-mails: "Today the night was not accessing NSA.g. for several hours, due to an internal error that occurred during pre-destructive updates."
This problem will be solved tonight.
This claim is not true because of an attack on the service distribution [D.O.S.] attack.
In the evening the online server trackers found that the website was closed for at least six hours, and some users still have no access.
The director of NAC told A.C. News that the agency's internal, sensitive networks were not "even understood."
The spokesman said no classed information is in danger.
At least one master group has claimed they are responsible for interrupting the website by DDO.S. attack.
The DDODC attack is designed in such a way that the target website will be sent on too much traffic until the site is closed because the server is loaded.
This ambiguous strategy is relatively unconstitutional and the aim of attacks is not to separate the internal networks of the system.
Former extremely mysterious N.A., which was never named "no agency," has become a subject of discussion between the common people and the events of domestic spying programs in the past month, which have become a subject of bitter criticism between the common people and those of the general.

The following September will not even present a update on issues for his brandy plane any flying test data releases the data or the plane will be able to go into commercial service from September September September.
Test is about half a month after the first flight of the plane, it's just caught three times, the question raised whether the test phase is on track.
The result has been lower than the forecast and sent to the stock market for over 8 percent of the slides.
Cameron Antonysen, a analysis of the analysis with the National Bank dasis had reduced his rating for Thursday "Rami" to Thursday, or during the next one or two quarters.
"The plane delivery was most expected, we're obviously disappointed with the presentation in transportation," said Portsin in a client note.
We'll get a new order for Bommaberes as progress of flight program.
However, if no one is declaring in months to come new orders, no doubt that the market program will be commercialized.
It's expected that the plane family can now cut it off at the low end of the labyrinary and airy market.
The first test plane in March and after the late month was flew for the first time in September.

We decided to take a first flight and an update period and say what we did.
That flight program will be all through.

The parents of Georgia’s teenage boy who was killed in a ‘ criminal accident ’ believe that his son was murdered
A teenage girl in Georgia whose dead body was found wrapped in Retling Matthew in her high school Jim, believes that her son had been murdered, that the family’s name, Yahweh, said on Thursday.
Valdoist Johnson, K.A. on January 11, was found standing straight behind the conferences inside his high school Jim.

Benjamin Benjamin Chindy, who is present to Keneth and Jack Johnson, said to Phx Dotcom, "They totally believe that their son has been murdered."
They don't trust death in the way we've been told.
Indicate said, "They believe it is beyond physical law and common reasoning."
They think this is an excuse for the conclusion, responsible person or people's safety for their son's death.
He said he had sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned in a body bag."
The U.S.R. Y. Murira Murder told Guru that he was making a formal investigation about Johnson's death, seeing that there are many significant questions.
What was the cause of death?
Did he get killed for some crime?
Mmother said that on Thursday afternoon, a journalist conference in the afternoon.
I will observe the testimony. Let them bring us where they may be led.
My purpose is to bring the truth to the front.
He said, "I think the environmental factors are there for a formal investigation."
Moore said to the reporter that theater's body tests give signs that Johnson's death was a result of the "Inception".
According to Moore, there was a different reason for death in a second body trial.
He said, "There are many questions that should be answered or confirmed."
Moorey also said that if he found sufficient witnesses to find sufficient witnesses to find a wrongdoer or investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson, he would say to the F.B.I.
Visiting Thursday, delegates were not immediately available to comment from the office of the Lodz County Corporation.
On Wednesday, South Georgia's judge ordered the more guards to continue all the videos that were reviewed by the Testers.
The boy's parents say they'll hope they'll have some signs from the video footage to how he died.
C.D. issued a call to children’s senses for schools
On Wednesday the disease control and prevention center issued direction to control children’s food intolerance in school.
The U.S. government has issued such directions for the first time, because the number of children in school is increasing by food intolerance.
Now one of the 20 children in U.S. has food intolerance.
C.D.C. found that among children between 1997 and 2007, food intolerance has increased by 18 percent in cases of food intolerance.
In this direction students and staff are informed how to inform children about food intolerance, and how to handle it in the case of any emergency reaction.
The schools have also been suggested that they have the stock of Alivia to cope with the life - threatening bureaucracy - which is the auto-interceptor of Amara, which is generally used.
The State Meeting has recently updated in laws, so schools can easily preserve the stock of eurephain.
This report includes a list of common symptoms being transmitted by children with Elgalactic response.
Children can say, "It seems that something's poison in my tongue," "It seems like my tongue's too little," or "my tongue's sneezing."
Parents of the 16dhens can choose their children to ‘ run away ’
Germany has become the first country of the European Union, which has granted recognition to the third sex for children born with uninjudicwise.
The newborn children will no longer be specified male or female in the light.
In accordance with the new law, parents don't need to declare sex for such children, this law allows them to pronounce ‘une ’ or "free" on a child’s birth certificate.
The purpose of the new law is to lower pressure on parents who can rush into the decision regarding sex - surgery for newborn children, and fight prejudice against sexually transmitted children.
According to the B.B.C.C., an immoral person said years later, "No, I'm a man, no woman."
I'm going to make a spot of the wound made by physicians.
According to estimates, there is one child among 2,000 children who doesn't have a male or a female.
They are interconnected, part of a group of nearly 60 situations, which come across tests of sexual development, this is a collective word that will select unusual attributes, childbearing (unsorcients or hypnomy), or inconception.
Maybe we're having an Internet Internet interaction.
The male identity is not considered to be right yet, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information available to specify sex when sex is not possible and to perform surgery, if that happens, to monitor the psychological and physical development of a child.
New York's psychologist Dr. Jack Dr. Jack Dr. Dr.
Interactal children create moral confusion.
They said, "Some people are in a state of anguish for which surgery is needed, but it is not like that with most children."
You can specify the sex without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of learning how a sex will develop in a child is not very precise.
No one can rightly answer about why it happens.
It's kind of a puzzle why people are gay.
The U.S. report entered in 2011 is described as a different way of dealing with people who were transmitted to the European Democratic or Transiter because their situation is not related to sex but to its biological makeup, which is not clearly related to either man or woman.
These features can display themselves in secondary sexual practices, such as the weight of the muscles, the distribution of hair, the breast and length; the primary sexual activity, and the caliberlike organs; or the shape of the subservience.
This report also provides lionization about prejudice, oppression, violence and discrimination against crime, with cases of sexual intercourse and suicide among people.
Now there are special camps for non-captive sex boys.
Australia and Nepal have already been allowed to mark adults on their official documents, men, or women, as well.
In June, 52 - year - old Australian Navei became the first "International" approved-free" person of the world after winning a legal appeal to keep sex rights.
According to the internal Ministry, the German passport will have a third specified X to non-existent persons apart from M or F.
According to the news report on France, the issues related to the sex in France are still conflicting.
In 2011, this strict French law from the Catholic country has signed dozens of French lawmakers to go back from school books to the board.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also resisted this law in Germany, saying, "When the world is going into a state where sex is going to be selected itself, but not sex, we're taking two columns in the opposite direction of civilization."
In Maryland, the newborn baby's mother also told Karen that she would like to see the sex being specified at birth.
They said on the website about raising your child on the website, "Birth is very stressful without limits, especially if you don't even know what your child's sex is."
Children need stability and stability.
Historyably, children born with both male and female had been called Harmappiteites, who were in the name of a beautiful Greek god who was bilingual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world had considered sex as slate which could be removed and rewritten.
But now a lot of people are challenging the morality of surgery, they realize that sex-in-law is complicated work, and sometimes even the physicians, who don't even know how to feel about their sexual obligations when they get older.
Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr.
When these children were born, you didn't call a philosopher, you called a surgeon.
The current theory about treatment of children with schizophrenia was presented by Dr. John Many, who considered sex to be acceptable.
He created the word "idling identity" and reasoned how social and environmental signals raise children - children with genes and homonons determine that he is recognized as male or female.
But in one case of 1966, known as John/ Jovanan, their doctrines became controversy.
They advised parents to remove the baby and remove him from the child’s womb, and do like his red-smoking girl.
Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr.
At 15 years of age, the child returned as a male and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Dreyer said that some doctors are still "following the same representation."
But during the 1990 ’ s with the arrival of the Internet, these men who passed through the sex surgery began to appear “not happy with what they saw. ”
Such was the case with the 36 - year - old writer Jim Bruce, who was born with the X.L.A. quality, but his inconstitution was outlawed.
The physicians didn't clearly understand his sex was short, or he was a big man, but they were sure that he could never live "chur life" as a man.
So shortly after he was born in 1976, Bruce was fired by the external organs and antactic surgery and was raised as a girl.
He was given female Horon at 12 years of age.
She said to ABCNews.com, "I didn't know I'm a girl."
I wasn't happy, but questioning was too hard.
At 18 years of age, he was going to be with mermogent.
But feeling frustrated and something wrong, he demanded medical records.
It showed him frightening truth.
At birth I was bound, and nobody ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.D., who prevented her body from making sufficient tests, which could not have developed properly.
After he had known the truth, he became a man. He ate the testotoron, and stopped his breast.
Because of surgery, she became barren.
Today, he teaches people to make their notion common in the organization called Infamous Project.
However, a group of California-based method groups of Advisseses and Instincts express concern that the German law is "teachy and humiliating."
He says, "Many obstinacyists think that the law of Germany will enable the parents to make quick decisions and to specify the child "free"."
We fear it will encourage intervention.
Instead of waiting for us, specifying male or female sex is better process.
But we don't know how the law will play its role, so we can just guess.
Tam-trains said that their organization supports the Australian law because it allows adults to be recognized in the third sex."
He said, "You young ones must be able to decide their own way of life."
German law is related to specifying it at birth.
It's not the war to fight by newborn children at this time.
When adults, they can make decisions regarding their own body.
But the breast radioist Dr. Erley Barts, of Johannesburg, said that the law of Germany would give power to both parents and children."
The daughter of Bartsji was born with catalyst male qualities, but she was full and undying, named DSD.
Because there was a fault in her and in her husband's sperm, the woman in the cat developed condoms.
She has her body but the womb or the egg is not.
Now a 29 - year - old Cattolica is married and is adopted into the child psychology department at Pennsylvania University.
Although she is barren, but she hopes to be mother through an egg or a commercial head.
Barts said, “This law allows parents to make their own decisions quickly.”
It provides them with a proper understanding and time for some testing before writing them, ‘man, ’ or ‘woman’.
In that way, you live well - raise a child, love the baby.
You have a lovely baby and enjoy it.
We don't have to get blood surgery in haste that can't be returned.
They said, "It brings the children into the process of making a decision and frees parents from the fear of an enemy that is about to motivate them because they do not believe that they are right."
Finally, the child will determine which sex is more easy with -- and it will be very good.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

Another story of fear of independence, another day
This time we are warned that EU will need free Scotland to join the independent travel zone in all Europe as condition of membership.
They point to stories about the passport control and the border of wires on the walls of Hetwick.
The truth is that the St. Petersburg paper described the potential economic benefits of free will with the rest of Europe, even though it did not describe them as predictably--the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe EU. Members spending most of their time changing their formal rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer the zone, Brauna will continue to receive what she wants from Scotland.
So, then, Amani.
And the thing that has been caught so long ago is getting stronger. First I heard the "Freeance means passport control" the fake news almost 40 years ago.
Yet this interesting old story lost the interesting point to tell again.
Why should even expect Europe to be counted through independent Scotland?
Why be traded for Yoko of London, especially now?
Here's the real European news: Great, war-to-do plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the U.S. crisis, the project is officially dead.
The dedicated crew in the entire E.U are getting stronger in to resist EU or shutting the euro off as similar currency.
Even in Germany, the U.S.A., the U.S. N.
There's always been domestic conflict with plan to build federal Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, proved to be a radical change.
With the harsh rules imposed by Berlin and Europe’s Central Bank, many have had to think that Europe has gone far away by following the same currency.
The high budget of national governments did not play a lot of role in the crisis of Euro-- that was only the truth in Greece.
Rather, the U.S. system fixed its members to the key exchange rate in favor of German exporters-- things that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of the possibility of domestic currency desensition, South Europe finds itself in the underlying situation of productiveness compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce pay and's pay - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
Ongoing budgets and high European producers outer than problems.
To release French and German energy firms on user supply, Europe's industry pay four times as much for the power policy as the United Nations.
That's the cost that we've seen in Gravitymouth already.
Even in the world all the wages being paid, European Pantrocel industry cannot be affected by cheap U.S. shell gas.
As a result, rebellion has been raging among the people, especially in France, who was once a fan of EU.
The top politicians of France after U.S. had seen E.U control Germany, and Paris as a means of providing Billings of Billington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has applied its own financial policy on Europe, which has resulted in the economic decline of France.
The result: Mary Lan Lee's south prognosis, E.U. The anti-Creator has recently won a victory over a recent socialist in the election post.
The front 24 percent vote in France right now is the most popular party in France with the front 24 percent vote-- it's a warning for the British leber that they can't go to accept that for the left, automatically benefit for the right.
What's the pen doing with his newfound reputation between French Gorers, the working class?
This team uses EU. E.C. elections to create an anti-virus group in the European Union.
If, as is so possible, in these elections E.U. opposers do well, this kind of party can first affect European state.
My outlook is this: Soon E.U and the anti-consistent conspiracy will end the cycle of opposing anti-existence in Europe.
Euro won't be completely over, but it'll be footing and coming back to Europe (the Lord) of the nations, which will support general bloodbath.
Germany and its poor economy can maintain Euro, but France and South Europe will re-unite their currency.
I hope UK will keep itself away from this project in hopes of developing close friends with U.S.
However, the growing interest in the Nashgenton in Argentina indicates that Britain will be left in cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland most of these?
We can choose to remain in the remote area of Little England.
Or we can protect our own financial interests, which includes telling Berlin and Brittts to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland will have better jobs in the winter European system, if we put our own value.
It would be easier to work together with other similar thinking nations in Europe in non-international states.
Otherwise we should consider maintaining our economic freedom on the road to Norve.
The government has been the most successful nuclear campaign in Scotland - the most successful in Europe, who won the request by Lasslinger El Manser, and after that, the Tor-Di-Bom, was the highest in 2011.
For Scotland this time votes for freedom, because in that case it will be accepted by the laws of the stock being imposed by Berlin and Brent.
Ilvin before time: To grow up quickly
Research shows that African-American and Hippian girls get desensitized at a young age when they are younger than they are.
Physical change does not mean that gravity is near at hand
There are no witnesses that homonon or any other chemicals can be blamed
Experts believe that obesity can be a reason for puberty in short life
Andrew's case is not as effective as the boys before time
In the health and family issues of former U.N., former U.S. president P.
Should mother be worried, if breast development and births began at 7 or 8 years of age at the age of 7.
This week, Orlando, U.S. Child Medical Association at the U.S. Child Medicine Institute in Florida, U.S.A., made it clear that these early physical change is common among American girls, which is a new trend.
Maukkukk said, "I spend a lot of time trying to convince my parents that this usually doesn't mean a quick advance in the direction of the full moon."
The form of growth is seen before time in the hair and physical smells of the tissues of the tissues and the skin.
But in the past four decades, there has been a very minor change in the age of the West (first month).
In the United States, average age 12.5 is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breast starts to grow, it takes at least three years in the first row which takes at least three years," explains Capolcons, who are also required to deal with this common problem."
It's the most exact test time of your development.
Andrew's beginning is the debate about what's started, but when breast development increases before 8 years of age, it says "baul-f-ul."
In most cases this process will be slow or stop - whose child doctors can easily inspect.
In a more early progress situation, Andremontians may need a test so that the chances of serious problems like tumors or diasporas can be resolved.
There are treatments to delay long-time periods of menstruation and other consequences: during the time of the osteoces, which may result in a lack of balance as untransgressive growth and adult.
Drugs or homorons depend on the age of a child, growth rate, increase rate, and emotional adults for treatment.
Psychologists are also important.
Maukkkwick has Awake! but admits, "Fighting the planet can increase the smoothing point, and girls may feel separated from their peers."
The second big problem can be understood: Parent just doesn't want his daughter to have a monthly period.
"They worry about the dangers of the womb, or how they will keep clean."
A woman whose daughter had started menstruation at 10 years of age recalls, "It was a blow."
Although there were symptoms of this and we even talked about menstruation, but she wasn't emotionally ready.
She became afraid of her school and was upset that her friends had started her first monthly religion.
There are a lot of well-known principles about the causes of noncommeritation Jenkins.
Yet, there is no constant witness that the milk or other food fields can be blamed on chemical or media messages in the environment.
Boys like girls are getting the same time-in-law.
Caplolovze decides that the main cause of it is the rage of corruption.
He had helped conduct studies on girls from 6 to 9 years of age in 2001, linking the fat of the body to the time of Jinvan.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are also many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hulyn girls have a tendency to get married before their age-born fair girls.
There are so many explanations of this thing.
On global levels, the representation of time-altarism, from economic conditions to weather and genes, appears to be affected by everything.
Other puzzles: Even though boys are getting under the age of facial hair, girls are not as clear as girls among them.
Other physicians who attended the APP conference supported the complexity of the subject.
Even among infants and children, the hair of the eggs and the hair of the eggs is common.
“ We need to be careful about how we identify the real start of the planet in the hospital, ” says Dr. Scotian Andreenman, in New York City, “when we recognize the real beginning of the moon, ” says Dr.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their child doctor to consider how to talk to their children.
Caplok advised, "It may mean to talk before the expected time."
If you're calm, your baby will usually answer correctly.
Girl development of long ago requires to be reassured that even though it has been prior to time but it is part of normal life.
The valianter's been recorded in temperature by 3.1 degrees Fahrenheit [3.1 ° C].
The rain and cold air on Wednesday night made people realize the coldest.
They clothed the valiant man, went out to the marketplaces, and to their destinations.
The first winter is when people have taken the kingdom out.
People came to watch in the morning, even enjoying incense.

With controversy on seat width at the great order of jet builders.
This month Dubai sets up a competition for strife between tourist pilots for long-range flight flights
The debate is focused on the width of the seat of the long flights in Ilano, not always like that given by Arlines, but at the place where the station has claimed to be the Sector ester esambos and the Bogo company.
Erin Nanoin gives at least 18 inches [18 cm] in this week, the hope of such a industry standard, but it should be determined by Erlines by its chief - Seventh Century.
The debate occurs between the pilots when a long - distance train in the design of a long - distance train was competed to sell after an incident of 17-21.
How has the previous department of plane been created-- especially that's what sing 9 or 10 is equal to equal to an increased capacity being created to design the minitox jets in view?
For example, in the United States alone, 1 out of every 4 million people is said to be “777 X ” that will place 46 inches [17 cm] wide and 10 in a row in an international department.
Airi says it will take 350 people 18 inches [18 cm] left in the seat, struggling with A350.
The plane often hit technical matters through advertising in business press.
Now, Air just 777 X is expecting to be overcome by more than 100 order in the Otto, this is appealing to the public.
You've been looking for anything to get started with the Dantantant War in recently, and you'll accept it as a partner with three of them at once, showing it?
The Air Cars chief John Lehe said "is offering long-range flight from the Regional Stunbos."
As a change, people get great, but the way the plane moves is not changed.
According to U.S. magazine, between the 1970 ’ s of the 1970 ’ s when Bowing 747 Jenneh traveled on the modern - day map, and a 40 - 49 - year - old U.S.A., U.A., U.S.A.A., had a 10 - percent increase in weight 10 percent.
According to American Health Statistics, the average American man's waist in the 21st century is 397 inches, according to American Health Statistics.
The appeal to Airs is tied to a seat concept in 1950 when a new name set was the continuity.
Airpath says he's established research Lowization in the seat's width to suggest an additional code of 53%% of sleep correction.
It has argued on statistics of the seat size of the Airs, and has said how this does not depend on the decision of species.
It also says, research shows that the width of a seat depends on the experience of more than the width.
It is actually a matter of giving airline control and faith in things that they need to be successful. ’
"They don't want to tell us what they're benefiting from."
They know their business better than someone else.
It's about the waterfalls, but for the supplyers, it's a faster point that it can affect income.
At least 700 billion dollars' business behind this debate is the contraband of the aircraft in the coming decades of the U.S. and European export to balance the scales.
First in July, the seat layout mentioned by Ryan's reporting is actually a battle issue between new jet aircraft.
Airborg and Bowling have claimed the seat of 20 percent working in the design, compared with the 36555 -300 model showing in the design of that section.
The claim of Bowing depends on the ability of 1077 x forest construction to compare with 777 design.
10 is using the unit costs with profit now the comparison.
Kevin Katten, head of the Air Traveling facility in Europe, says: "This is their plane is about to capture more seats with our products, with their products."
On the other hand, commentators say that the entire 10-year-old line assigns 777 S to the present 777 S.
The Internet expert inside my head, the founder, and the Runner girl of the editor said "The seat of 18 inches will be very good for passengers, but the reality is that this business point of air is conducted by the threat of 777"
Air just don't provide air and ground seats but provide a list of food for the Air Forces to select.
Let also the jet deal with the world's jet salesmen carefully check this layout.
More comfortable, even all the pilots are paying high density layouts for jet aircraft services and high density travel inland travel.
He says he's not selling it now, a 10-50 but one 10 equal to A350 but he's not selling it.
But until recently, airbos often stressed the widespread caliber seats of some of its jet aircraft to need more gear.
It's not the possibility of flying off a new industry balloon without support of modern jet aircraft but it can distract from the wave of 777 X sales.
A new anti-virustration vaccine can finish the enjoyment of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-virusion vaccine, which can end the fun that comes from smoking.
The same dose of vaccine, the rats were able to protect themselves against the addiction of Nkotism for the whole lifetime.
Man needs further testing before being tested, in which several years may take place, but professor of Veldal Medical Science in New York said that there are positive signals.
Professor Laksel said: "We hope that the strategy of this vaccine can finally help millions of cigarettes, who have tried to quit smoking using all manner of smoking in the market in modern times, but they found that their addictions are more powerful than these current methods."
The new vaccine has a harmful virus, which has been prepared to bring genetic information to an anti-virus.
This virus, selects the virus, which begins to create a permanent stream of anti-virus after it.
Antibiotics search for any toxic molecules in blood, and prevent them from getting rid of smoke smokes within the body before they reach them.
In testing, the vaccine rats who were later given the explosives continued their normal activity.
Researchers say that but the rat who was not given the vaccine looked "goodly," it was a signal that decay had reached his brain.
This usage was described in a magazine called Science Public Medicine.
The former tobacco vaccine had failed because they had antiblasts.
There was to be food in regular intervals, so that antibesy would remain level, but she proved to be expensive and unsurpassed.
But the price of the new vaccine is going to be too much, because the virus will make the cell the factory of antibody.
Professor Crystal Wells said that if the future human vaccine has been completely safe, it can be given children before smoking, as well as against the urge to break free from the addiction of tobacco.
But probably its use will be used to quit smoking by persons who smoke.
He will know that if they start smoking again, they will not find any joy in smoking because of a vaccine that can help them get rid of their habit.
British scientists explained the result interesting, but warned the need for a lot of research done.

457 The alien employee can pass through the trial "Pureness" test
The government's considering a "Pure" test for foreign workers at 47xis, because its aim is to expand a strict action.
If adopted, this test will be applied through a set of 457 programs designed to prevent appropriate positions in Australia, or in the emergency way used by family and friends.
Today, a government discussion letter was issued, condemning the government’s voice for foreign workers, former LMP. Max McCuck said today that it can provoke neighboring countries in Australia.
He said to the U.S. president of the United States Today, "The foreigners are reaching the end of the queue" and "The Australian people who first committed their jobs are very disgusting at such a time, even though the Union has demanded a secure labor market."
historically, it meant that white workers should have been given protection - and if some people in the area saw the retinuation of that historical testimony, then I wouldn't be surprised.
The discussion letter displayed 12 measures, which were previously considered by former Pictor Chris Boven.

Through the British government, the HS2 railway project has announced a study for increase in the benefits of Scotland.
The work by HS2 points to high speed services in Scotland and the north of England, which will soon begin with the first phase in 2026.
Transport minister Hater Croesser told this project that "Bon will be united."
The Guardian minister, Kath Brown, said that they are a lot of "supervised" by working with the British government on this project.
The first phase will include a new high - speed train line between London and West Medlands.
When the second phase is completed, lines will reach Henry and leads.
In June the government transformed the construction costs of high speed link between London and North England to 2327 Billian.62.69.
The British government, who was conversing with Scotland transport, instructed HS2 Lid to consider the time of train and travel to North England and Scotland and to improve the quality of the journey.
This includes Glassgo and Edinburgh expected to have three hours or less of a journey from London to London.
According to hate Creser: "Our goal for HS2 is the real national network, which will draw the poor and its cities."
We're moving with HS2, because its benefits will be great.
Without it, we'll face problems related to our railway network's ability.
But it's also about the connectment of 18 cities in Britain, including Glassgo and Edinburgh, which will be added better because of HS2.
According to Scotty Secretary Ellister Card: "The announcement today is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Kath Brown appealed the "Clear" return of Scotland in the HS2 network from Mr. Carnico.
Mr. Brown explained: “Suppose speed trains are likely to bring financial benefits to Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in a high - speed train throughout Britain.
So we're excited to work in the partnership of the British government, so that we can create high speed in Scotland, create benefits for all, and check options for the fulfillment of Glass-Agdenburg line of which the Polish government is already planning.
I'm ready to review a test report with British government counselors next year and make a decision together on further action.
A plane electric device rules will now prevail in Australia
In US the equipment will continue to shut up the boudus of soft - moving steps, Australian air pilots taking flight, and the plane will climb up while the aircraft moves.
US Union aircraft administration has opened up the options for American air service companies to change their procedures, so that passengers will be able to read e-book, watch, video, or play the game during the crucial stages of flying, provided they remain in the "Cronian" mode.
Travelers can still do this during a lot of flights, but it is not good for many people to be able to move off and reach their E-book etc. when the plane moves off.
Australian Air Service companies are considering this decision, according to which US Air Services companies will have much more work to accomplish, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plans to change their processes.
The citizen plane security authorization also said that he was thinking about announcement, but Joe gave the ban on using electrical devices in the vital steps of flight in Australia.
"In the present, near CASA, there is no specific formula to control the power of power tools in the plane," said the authority, "the issue is that the plane's service operations are always built up, and the security instructions given by crew members are to follow."
Virginia, who is already talking with CAS with CAS to follow this change, said to take further action on the instructions of the recipient.
Asker said, "We'll welcome review by CAS, as we actually think it will provide better experiences to customers, since we now have our aircraft.
Franz said it would now keep the current rules.
He said, "We can't be used with power tools while flying and landing the plane, and we have no immediate plan to change it."
FAA judgment applies to the U.S. Elarline.
By the way, we are always interested in scientific developments that can benefit passengers, and we will surely consider FAA's decision and reasons behind it.
The effect of this decision will be different on each US air service company and will depend on the days of their plane.
Air Service companies will need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio activity from mobile devices, and they will have to adapt to brief details of their rules, training, training programs, and passengers.
FAA said, "The aircraft will allow passengers to hold hands on all the heights, but with slight weight access, such as a Tebble, e-ficiary, and smartphones."
In rare cases of low visibility, the driver will direct crew passengers to stop his equipment while flying.
The group has also suggested holding heavy equipment safely under a seat or keeping up the upper container during flight and landing.

On the sentence of a bomb blasting in the ear
In 2002 the families and relatives of 202 people who were killed in the bomb blast, described the bomb blast as being put to death, saying that the amputees should face the fireing team.
The mirror, which ran away as one of the most wanted persons in south East Asia for about 10 years, was sentenced tomorrow 20 years to its role in building an explosive device used in the bomb blast.
Permill can be released in 15 years.
45 - year - old Ommar was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two Nights in the famous tourist area of China, with 202 people killed, including 88 Australians, and a number of people were wounded.
He was also found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including a series of bomb blasts in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors had demanded life imprisonment, even though they could even demand that the bomber be called the looter's "defeater" man who said this person should be executed.
The decision restored the painful memories of June Kasuye, who lost his 39 - year - old daughter in a disastrous attack by a decade ago and his coronists.
He was supposed to be put to death by the fire while stopping his closes.
I really feel that she should have received just the same punishment as other Communist terrorists.
Ms. Courtent said to A.P., "He must be standing in front of the fireing team."
I have to live without my grandchildren and my daughters every day.
Just after the night of 12 o'clock in October 11 2002, the entire club was destroyed after the blast had been loaded out of the van.
Peter Huguegenus, the bag full of explosive stuff filled by suicide attackers, was in the pad bar just 20 seconds before the explosion began.
They died three times as a result of this bomb blast.
Mr. Huguegenz says that the pen was supposed to get the same sentence as the case was responsible for this male genocide, which was given to three other members of Islam Islam - Amiroz, Machalas, and Miragas, and the Amira Sea - which had been executed four years ago.
In fact, this person should be executed before someone else.
See, there's no reason to keep her alive, there's no reason to keep her alive.
After killing 202 people and treating countless people, 20 years is not enough.
The last person who gets punished by the fire, the ear bomb explosives.
He survived to be caught for nearly a decade, but finally, in January 2011, he was arrested at Avebadaba in Pakistan, where U.S.A., former Alidard main o'clock had been killed for four months.
During the trial, F.A.I.A. report showed that the South African terrorist groups were in Pakistan trying to reunite the contact.
Ms. Courtey says, "She didn't surrender."
Even today, so many people are not really suffering mental pain.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by events in ear and Australia.
"This year," said Mr. Halley, "will shed much tears."
Still the firelet could appeal against your punishment.
FAA: Air Forces can now use Gadgets in the air (but cannot call cell phones)
Air Travelers will be able to read from gate to gate, read from work, play games, watch television, listen to music, but they will not be able to talk to their telephone - but this Thursday is a subject of intense new directions issued by the Internet administration.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, the administrator of FAAA, said of how fast these changes are done, it would be different in every airline.
The airlines must tell the airline how their aircraft completes new directions, and how members of their crew are up to display the training of members of their crew to protect the device.
The FAAA said that it has already been able to get plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on the plane.
Deltas and jetbikes are among the airlines that have already presented plans.
The FAAA said in a statement: "On the basis of the project situation, we can soon accept the advanced use of electronic devices.
More recently, passengers need to shut their smartphones, Tet, and other devices off the plane door.
They are expected not to start reaching the height of 10,000 feet of the plane and allowing it to be allowed by captain.
Travelers are expected to redraw their equipment when the plane is off, and not launch it until the plane is completely gone.
F.A., said the airlines under the new directions are carefully safe and safe, allowing passengers to fly by plane, falloff time, and use the taxi device's device.
Most of the new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified in this way are supposed to be using Yphararar at higher altitudes, which are expected to meet these demands.
The chairman of the Union of the Council of International Flight, Corresponding, has welcomed these changes.
Carning said in a description: "When a policy is laid bare safely, and we'll work with airline companies to do that, then it'll be a windown for both sides."
When it comes to this issue, we've been getting bored like we realize that.
The agency said that but less than 10,000 feet [ 10,000 m] should pass the Internet, using email exchanges, sending or receiving messages, or getting data will still be banned.
Travelers will be asked to keep your smartphones, Tecette and other device devices in airplay mode.
So still there can be no conversation with friends, like a online Scotel game, which is the famous event that in 2011, when an emergency plane was playing on its smartphones while running the plane at the entrance in 2011, and when they were forbidden to close the device, the American airlines had driven them off from the plane.
And yet there must be a collection of laptops like heavy tools, which will still be concerned about the other person’s injury in his flight.
The phone call will continue to be banned during flight.
Ventantantantial communication commission involving phone calls comes near, not with FAA.
FAA can ban some electronic devices during flight and landing.
Last month Mark M.C.A. of National Transport Security System, a national security expert in the U.S. News, said that the cell phone is still viewed as risk.
The day-to-day said, "Lell phones are really a serious issue, not just because they can potentially cause misunderstandings in the navigational device, but because they can also create the telephone towers when they are in the air.
To investigate this point, the industry's counseling committee, formed by FAAA, has granted the government more use of personal electronic devices last month.
They use them to reduce the ban in FAA but under pressure in recent years.
C.," said critics like Keon MacCuk, D-Let's say there's no valid protection for the ban.
Getting started these restrictions is even more difficult because using the device is simmerent.
Some studies also indicate that nearly third passengers forget or ignore instructions to close their device.
FAAA. started baning the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when passengers received a report on navigation and communication devices that had been blocked by FM.M. radio and the high technology of that period.
New Airlines companies are more dependent on electric systems than on previous generation of aircraft, but they are also designed and accepted by FAA to resist electronic intervention.
Airlines have been offering the Y-fifling height from passengers for years.
The aircraft modified for the Y-f-fune system are also more resistance to nervousness.
Zartra said that most airline companies should meet firms for further use of electronic devices in the new direction.
Today's electronic device, little radio transmitter of the radio transmitter compared with the electronic device of the previous generation.
For example, there is a totally unique transmission during the E-RDCs, page flips.
But the transmitter is effective when downloading data from a device or sending it.
The passengers have also been Amzajon.com from those who take part of the restrictions on the device using the device.
In 2011 the company authorities loaded their entire fleetal e-mails in Airlines and attacked him for tests of problems but found no such problem.
The FAP committee has expressed a positive spirit about the risk of using the device.
The director of the National Air Traveling Association said that they believe that a problem is real, even if the risk is real.
Other members of the committee said that there are only reports described by pilot in support of the device being blocked by the air raid system, most of which are very old.
However, members of the committee allowed FAA pilot to allow them to close the device when taking the plane down in low visibility.
The travel industry has welcomed changes and has given them general knowledge of people traveling in the latest rounds of technology.
U.S.News & Association Dr. Roger Dot said that we are happy that FA has recognized that the passengers who travel with joy are not inconsistent with rescue and security.

Is the high class of Europe ready to trade with Britain?
In April America business Fore was launched and promised to bring business together and to determine what change would be in our relationship with UK and prosperity builder E.U.
To him we asked what they thought about Britain's business with the biggest and most widespread surveys of Britain's commercial leaders holding them.
U-Gaven has assigned 1,000 businesses to the thinking of those who take the lead in Britain, who are representative of the commercial size, areas and places of the country.
The conclusion of this survey may be amazing to many.
We found that a large portion of businesses now want to export out of Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming and increasing, though EU.U.
They want the government to give priority to new business relationships with such countries as China, India, Brazil, and Brazil, not to get involved in the long and miserable operation of EU's mysterious organizations.
When asked about specific policies such as the law from one rights intelligence to the product, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should come back to Westminster.
In fact, the cost of Brent’s bronchium to Brush, with a single market could be very easily seen, is far more than advantage of the profit of the commercial region of Europe. Even huge faithists, who were mainly side by European companies, agreed to this.
In the end and most clearly, our survey of commercial leaders found that, a large part of it wants Britain, E.U, to increase the route to business based on relationships and peace rather than politics.
This conclusion, seen in the standards of major carmen groups, shows that a staple is inspired to a "value change" that can give back its power to UK.
Its high price is-- the point of change for Britain and finding a better deal made 16 percent change in favor of keeping up with E.U.
The prime minister should not be in any doubt: This survey supports Britain's Brits, E.U in order to talk about their plans at the terms of Britain's membership.
It also shows that carrots, expect the current power balance to change a meaningful change to UK for the sake of UK.
A better deal for British businesses is possible, and very fast it's going to be necessary, because  Euroone,'s moving forward in the direction of the economy and the imperial Union.
The priority must be jobs and increase in Britain, as the conclusions from our survey indicate that it means basic changes in the basic focus on business and the analysis of Brent's algorithms.

Scientists have further shed light on the subject of the connection between the tail behavior and its mood.
Previous research shows that happy dogs shake their tails toward the right (with the eyes of the dog), while the anxious dogs move their tails mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can recognize this precision of tail and express their reaction to it.
This study has been published in the Journal unseen by the Association Association.
Georgia, professor from University of Trentato, Georgia, said: “Men know all the way to know that the left and right side parts of the brain are different in the excitement that causes positive or negative emotions."
Here we've tried to see it in other races too.
He explained that even dogs like humans were responsible for brain activity on the left hand and in the opposite direction, and two of them played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to an intense noise by other dogs, researchers watched animals looking at other dogs' movies.
He measured the soft dogs' hearts and understood their behavior.
We probably don't have much time to understand why his pain sometimes moves on one side.
Procing the project: "We introduced the dogs to the movies -- in a shadow of what is realistic in a realistic version or in other doubt about other issues, and we could see the tail doing and put the tail to the left or right."
When the animals saw a cold dog shaking their tails (in the sight of a dog), they were completely comfortable.
But when they saw the tail changing primarily (from the left to the dog's view) their hearts grew and they looked nervous.
According to Vellarla, they don't think dogs were deliberately communicate with each other through these behaviors.
Rather, they think that dogs have learned from experience what they should be concerned about and what they should not.
He said: "If you've met other dogs many times, and if they constantly move their tail to one side, it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right part offers less friendly treatment, you respond to the same experience."
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better information about animals' feelings.
John Bradbos, expert of the behavior of dogs at the University of Bristol, said that to test whether it is not the first study or the left or right part for dogs is important to them.
Last year a survey of university students found that dogs turn their heads toward the left when they see an aggressive dog and turn their heads to the right when they see the happy dog.
In other research by University of Victoria in Canada, he stated: “The opposite of the illegal study, when the parent tail of the dog was shaken to the left, there was a greater chance of reaching the dogs than to be nervous."
He said this was the difference because dogs or robots in different studies didn't seem to be totally upset about animals or dogs.
He made it clear that it can help the dogs to respond to the real dogs.
"When there are ample evidence from different bronches that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, getting more detailed information is still there - and in this case the dogs are not exceptions," he said.
However, the easy way their behavior can be recorded seems to seem to make us think that it's probably not too much time for us to understand why their suffering sometimes moves one side to another.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
The Vatican announced to Thursday that Pope Francis 22 would first build a new cardinal for the Catholic Church in his work on February 22.
Cardinals are priests of the highest class in the Catholic Church, their positions are only below the pope, and these are the ones who choose the pope, so Francis will address the first group of his own people who will finally help in choosing their successor.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
Well, after nearly 80 years of age, cardinals are not allowed to share in the pope’s election -- it comes into a group of 120 "cards".
The Vatican’s spokesman Fatherly Lomband, one of the world’s secretaries, declared that before the ceremony for the new cardinals, all the present cardinals would be held at the conference, called Pope-rajandra.
Lombady said, "Defy Francis has decided to confirm his decision to hold February's Popeship so that it might be easy to plan plans for other assemblies of cardinals from various countries."
Jack Wellsler of the Catholic Herald said that until February there was a chance of losing the number of cardinal electers.
He generally announces the name of the cardinals, as few as 120 of the cardinals, and as they would like for 80 years, cardinals.
Well, Valero said that the pope of the next year would be important, since this would be the first pope meeting after Francis was selected this year in March.
Currently Europe is a kind of prejudice to Italy and especially to Italy.
He said "It would be interesting to see whether the new popes, even cardinals, to take care of the rest of the world.
In South America there is forty percent Roman Catholics, but their number is very low in cardinals.
The cardinals, by Francis, are a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who would be the first cardinals to be chosen after the reformation of the church.
Before the pope decided to decide everything to himself.
Valero said, "He just chose these eight cardinals to help himself."
He's like, that's "more likely" to ask Francis cardinals for advice.
But we're not in this situation first-- it's completely new.
Valero said that the popes generally give bishops of great places to the cardinals, but Francis "was very surprised, so we don't know whose name they will pronounce."

The Blast of Obama’s Nations
I gave Obama two times my vote instead of the change
They say that the G.O.P. strategy has caused great effort on Obama's part
Blocking policy of Obmaque website is not an excuse for drone attacks
The experience of Obaama, 2008 campne, reminds us of what could happen
The Nishnish P. Moris are the second year-old students in Harvard Medical School.
I've been reading very painful books today.
It's a book about which I think this will provoke my enthusiasm during the second year of medical school's poison and sense of hope in me.
His name is "Ken' courage", and it's Andrew of President Ebama, 2008.
When I spend the night with my patients and go to bed, this book takes me into a period in which politics had inspired millions of people and could hold your talk.
The election proved to be a side, and the press had a pause to highlight the historical significance of that time.
My schoolmates' eyes were glad. My parents saved the news every one who met.
A team of young telescopes was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
He had 82 percent approval ratings while he was president of Obama in 2008.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a painful memory of lost opportunities.
First time I went to vote, it really changed.
Simply put, none of these could imagine.
I give Obama a lot of success, and from Aford Keiter At, our army's return from Iraq, to the end of "Do not ask questions" to kill Obama Labour Laden.
Moreover, I believe that the policy of partial opposition has prevented many efforts to advance our country: including public options for raw reform, health care, closing airports at Guantanamo, and others.
But a number of times in which I put myself in favor of Obama administration in front of fellow workers and colleagues, and let me end up with the answer that I could give them.
I've reached the point of political despair.
The Republican policy is not the answer to the spy of foreign leaders, nor is the attack on innocent children in foreign lands.
It can't answer to save data about the personal lives of normal American citizens, nor to give a reply to people who expose the corruption of government.
It can't tell the cause of the murder of El Avisia without a trial, nor is it the public funding and balance limits of the President Camp.
It can't answer the conclusions of the report, which says that attempts to silence an em by the White House have been the most aggressive ever since the international administration.
And in most cases it can't excuse the failure of designing a simple website even after three years being signed in the law of Aford Keitable.
I don't know if I expected this.
If, at 18 years of age, I had to assume that the government system, which could rebut it, could contradict the political campaign.
Obviously, the well-known office is not a preamble way, for the anti-opposing political party and random events like that of the Newtown Killer will shape our public discussion.
Yet all the examples I've set above seem most to be selected by the administration.
That bothers you most.
I voted back in 2012 for Obama, but not because I was excited by her candidates.
Meati presented a confusioner and an indecisive choice, which seemed not to determine their policy or their office.
I thought that there would be another time for Obama, which would be free of the pressure of future choices, to complete the hopes we've been listening for a long time.
Yet, while OBama's Obma rating is less than 45 percent of this week, it has become very difficult to return to 2008 by that book.
I miss their remains when I see him.
This week there was reading a portion of the book described in what way the Chinton had suffered a great loss because of Obasin in Pennsylvania.
At a post-martam camp meeting, he told his slaves that they needed to return to the border, and that they needed to be honest on their purposes.
He said "I want to get my moone back."
We must remember who we are.'
I can't agree more with you today than five years later, President Sir.
The thoughts expressed in this comment are of non-transgressional Yiss.
Andrew Pharmer claimed that the future holiday plan is the best struggle for Tony Beaut.
The prime minister M.P.P.P.P.P.P.P. has said that the prime minister's goods for Tony Beau, because his daughters can become pregnant, and can take advantage of it.
The mighty angels of the clay region, who are in controversy over the carbon paying of $6 million, have claimed, while they have tried to answer questions about the strife.

Should the outcome of the election result in two months after our vote?
He said, "We must have a better system."
Why can't we have a system in which we should enter our license on the computer, vote immediately, and have consequences at 6:30.
Mr. Hammer also criticized the use of penicill to mark the papers.
This is because if a person does not like him, he can wipe it out?
In today's rounds, it seems incredible to use a pencil.
The election commission is studying options for electronic votes, and has recently issued a joint symposium with the New Testament.
Mr. 59 years old Mr. Fermmer said that his policies must build an international airport for the Coast, and they should take their new job "very serious".
Public term is for public service.
They said, "The award of history is that we can serve the community at this important time, and we have no other award."
That's why the promises have to have had trouble.
Back on this occasion, addressing the held assembly, Estela Albina, a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses, expressed intense excitement in the State law.
He proves that the criminals are unhesitating.
They have no fear of police and administrative order.
He's recently mentioned such events in various parts of the world, saying that the security of the general human being is beyond measure when the universe isn't safe.

Moving forward from clay, rivers, and forest to provide a temporary medical service
Dr. George Welel is reaching health care care in rural areas in Cameroon
Wel and his crew see hundreds of diseases almost every weekend
West African countries do not have too much doctors; 5000 people are just a doctor
Give your vote here or use a mobile phone
Dr. Georges Welberg is one of the 10 leading heros in C.N., 2013.
You can vote for them or for anyone other top 10 to create C.N.N. Year's hero.
The winning person will earn $50,000 to continue his extraordinary job.
For 21 years, George Wels Well saw his sick father come to his senses and swoon, going to the hospital, which was not well enough to help him.
Zia Weel, in 1981, was injured in a car crash near the capital of Cameroon.
Their only hand was broken in the beginning, but a infection spread to their brain, and it turned out blood, which affected the rest of their lives.
George Vilel says, "There was no neusseroutan in Chicago."
If we had money we could have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, they took their father with them, going around a large crowd of clinics and hospitals and receiving whatever treatment they could afford.
They said, "It's not easy."
You leave home at 5 o'clock in the morning hoping you'd be the first to reach the hospital, but not so.
There are many diseases.
Some may wait and fall into death.
In 2002 there didn't have been too much changes in position since Wel's dad's death.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5000 in Cameroon.
If compare, there is a doctor for every 413 persons in the United States.
And if there be physicians there, yet many of the men of Cameroon can't afford him.
Two of the five people live in the land under the poverty line, and nearly two thirds of the cost of health care in the country is about two thirds of the private area.
They say, "They're the only problem poverty."
And because they are poor, they can't enjoy their life.
And when they saw the sorrows of their father, and the sorrows of the inhabitants of their country, they determined to do something of it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have performed some 700 - page surgery last year.
They also became medical themselves, and began working as a corresponding surgeon in the hospital of Hedlund.
And he started non-captive organization Escoym, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide sulquerative medical services.
Since 2008, they have helped some 33,000 people, they and their own residents.
Every Friday they sit in the van and about 30 people, lock the medical supply with a roof, and go to rural areas where people need medical care.
Sometimes luck doesn't happen to them.
They must drive more than once a vehicle to push forward rivers and dust.
But when they reach, they actually have the honor of heros: the best residences to be offered by banquets, singing and dancing, and community.
In these villages there is really reason to celebrate the medical service, and wel - with our big smile and with endless energy.
The next morning their crew begins meeting hundreds of diseases.
They said, “We are meeting 500 people on each journey.”
They come from the village about 60 Kimes afar off, and they walk.
All these weekends provide various medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may find a list of bureaucracy, a flow of cash, or a cortical birth -- this document requires school but many poor family cannot afford to spend it.
In the evening the team performs simple surgery with the submergeic noun subspiration.
Operation usually goes to school house, Town Hall, or house; after processing, the patient goes to the emergency place, and makes room for the next person.
The generator of the group publishs in the room with the operations, and they do the projectal and their location work on Sundays morning and morning.
It's a backdrop, but the musicians in the village usually help keep the team moving.
They said, "They play us all night in order to keep us occupied and continue their work."
On Sunday their crew return to the city, they get tired, but they're proud of their job.
This group, including Cameroon’s doctors and foreign medical students, has performed some 700 operations last year, and they know that their help can change the world of people they help.
One man explained that because of his medical experience, he would be able to go back to work.
And he said: This will be changed for me and my family.
Besides working on the weekend clinic and the hospital as a surgeon, they also work on a private medical clinic around Yundick night.
He explained that it's their second job that spends 60% of their non-working work; the rest is covered by personal contributions.
“ I don’t know when they are sleeping.”
They are always in the hospital or are trying to make money for their organization so that they can continue to carry these campaigns.
O'O'MIVO is a practical time for American and European students who come from United States and Europe to join in the campaign of villey, which they can never get into their country.
O'Milley said, "We help Dr. We help clear tools or blood stains for Dr. Valle, we are able to experience a practical experience."
You will never have the opportunity to do so as a second-year-old student in America.
The students usually spend on their own to reach Cameroon, and they often come with the medical supply of contributions.
But after you have reached the end of their journey, they'll have to go and go and spend the instructions.
O'Ill say, "It's no doubt they're the hero."
They give their lives to this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never to end.
Wel, it's almost the same job, not hard.
Help others to live happy lives, fulfill the promise of their father, these are things that bring them great joy.
They say, "I'm so happy when I do this job."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to lower people's pain.
