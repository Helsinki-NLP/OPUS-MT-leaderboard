Members of the Welsh Assembly worried that they look like fools.
A concern has spread among some of the members of the Assembly regarding the proposal for changing their title in the MWP.
This has resulted from plans to change the name of the assembly in -Parlament of Wales.
The members of the Assembly from all over the political spectrum are concerned that this could spur ridicule.
An assembly member of the Laburist Party said his group was concerned - that this rhymes with Twp and Pwp -
To readers outside Wales: In the Wells, the tup means--butter and pup means--
An MP from the Welsh Party said the whole group was -- dissatisfied -- and has proposed alternatives.
A conservative Wellsian said that his group was unshaped - with regard to the name change, but it said there was very little difference between the words -MWP and -Budella
In this context, the pronunciation of the letters - w is basically similar to that of the letters - in the English of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently composing legislation on declaring the name change, said: \"Certainly the final decision on appointing members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves:
The 2017 Wells Government Law gave the Ulzine Tagrin assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a consultation with the public, and the latter's proposal for the appointment of the assembly as -Parlament of Wales - received broad support.
Concerning the issue of the Assembly Members' title, the Commission favoured the appointment - Members of the Wells Parliament - or - WMP - but alternatives -MWP found more support in a consulting with the public.
Apparently, members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative elections, but the fight for achieving consensus may turn to headscarves for Mayor Elin Jones, expected to present the legislation on changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes concerning the way the assembly operates, including regulations for the expulsion of Assembly members and the structure of the committee system.
During the discussion of legislation, the final vote over the issue of their appointment will remain to members of the Assembly.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on changing the country's name.
On Sunday, voters will vote for changing their country's name in the North Macedonia Republic.
The vote by the people was imposed in an effort to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly rejected its requirements for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on name change, has indicated that he will not recognise the votes.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's bells fall silent as churches in Harlem face difficulties
- Historically, the elderly people I talked to say there were from a bar and a church in each corner - said Mr. Adams.
-Today is both missing
He said that extinction of grass is understandable.
- In today, people are socialized in other ways, he says.
-Barts are no longer a neighborhood meeting point, where people regularly attend -
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from property sales will not last long enough for leaders to claim, and sooner or later they will return to the original point.
He added that churches can be replaced by residential palaces full of people who will not support the holy sites that remain in the neighborhood.
He said: “Most people who buy residential facilities are white, so soon the day will come when these churches will shut down once and for all, since it is immortal for most of the people in these apartments to become members of these churches to become members of them;
Both churches have been built by white congregations before Harlem converts into an Metropolitan Municipality Metropolitan Metropolitan in 1870, St. Martini a decade later.
The original congregation of white methodists moved in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was taken in possession of a congregation of colorful people who had enjoyed their place of worship nearby.
St. Martin spent a colorful congregation under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of minority merchants on the road -125th - a major market route in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote colorful people.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but after Father Johnson's parishioners made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the carion.
Rav. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and the heir of St. Martin, proudly called the chair of the poor.
The expert playing in the Carrio in July called it something quite different: a cultural treasure - and an unimportant historical unintruth -
Expert, Tiffany Nish from Michigan University, also indicated that this was the first career in the world to be played by a colored musician, Dionisio A. East, who moved to a larger chair in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin had not replaced him.
The recent events in St. Martin have been a complex tale of architects and contractors, some sent by secular leaders of the church and others from episcopal diocese.
The family-organizing council, composed of secular leaders - wrote to the diocese in July, with the concern that she - would try to transfer costs - to the parole council, despite the fact that the latter was not involved in employing architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained for lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark wound 13-year-old in a diving to catch crabs in California
A shark has attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived to catch crabs in California, on the opening of the crab season, officials say.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m., near the Beacon's beach in Encinninas.
Chad Hammel said that KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been immersing with some friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then he had rowed towards him along with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said that he had originally thought that the boy was just identified by the capture of a crab, but then I realized that he was yelling, and he bit me!
It bit me.
Hammel says that when he arrived at the boy, he found that his entire club was torn.
- I shouted all of them out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water,' Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the children's hospital - Rady's - in San Diego, where he was declared critical.
The shark's species responsible for the attack was unknown.
Coast Guard captain Larry Giles expressed a conference for the media that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but was designated as a safe shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
Officials banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad by Swami's in Ejitas for 48 hours, for investigation and security purposes.
Giles said there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most are considered safe.
Sainsbury's planning access to the MB cosmetic market
Sainsbury's competing Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with cosmetic cosmos of big shops, with a specialised vendor staff.
Under a considerable effort to enter the MB cosmetic market of 2.8 billion panuna, which is continuing to increase as the sales of fashions and household furniture suffer decline, the largest cosmetics will be tested in 11 shops around the country and spread to more shops later year if they result in success.
Cosmetic investment comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves used for television, microwaves, and household furniture.
Sainsbury's indicated that he would double his cosmetics bid to 3000 products, including for the first time such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Paw Paw.
Even the existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be given more space, with areas dedicated to respective brands, similar to those in shops like Boots.
The supermarket will also redirect its cosmetic Boutique line in the market so that most products can be made of vegan makeup - something that is increasingly required by buyers of younger ages.
In addition, retailer of perfumes -Fragence Shop - will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while a second is expected to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Online buyers and a tendency to purchase daily food in small quantities in neighborhood stores means that now supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has indicated that outlets will begin to look more and more like large shops, while the network of supermarkets tries to fight the reductions of Aldi and Lidl awards with more services and non-sustoric products.
Sainsbury's set out the outlets--Argas - in hundreds of shops and introduced a set of @habitats - that after purchasing both networks two years ago, which, according to him, has promoted the sales of food products and made the most profitable purchases.
The previous effort of the supermarket to restructure its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a union of societies with Boots in the early 2000s, but the union was disbanded after a debate on how to divide revenues from pharmaceuticals into its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury's sold his pharmaceutical business to 281 Celesio shops, the owner of the pharmaceutical network -Lloyds - for 125 million pounds.
He said that--Lloyds - would play a role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxurious skin-care brands, including La Roche-Pasay and Vichi to four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial leader of Sainsbury's, said: \"We have transformed the view of our cosmetics wards to improve our environment in behalf of our clients.
We have also invested in a staff with specialised formation, which will be available to provide advice.
The range of our brands is conceived in such a way that any need may be adjusted, and the attractive environment and convenient locations indicate that we are now a cosmetic yostic destination, which distinguishes from the old way we make purchases --
Peter Jones - furious - after Holly Willowby withdraws from the 11 million-pound deal
Daragons Den - Peter Jones' star has been removed - infuriated - after Holly Willowby television host has been withdrawn by an agreement of 11 million pounds with his business dedicated a certain life - style, to focus on its new contracts with - Marks and Spencer - and -/V)
Wloughby doesn't have time for their brand of household furniture and accessors - Truly-
The two of them were compared to the Gwynth Paltrow Market.
The 37-year-old host of Thhis Morning - headed Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has irritated the star of -Dragons Den - Peter Jones, following their recent withdrawal from their lucrative business dedicated to a life - style to focus on its new promising contracts with - Marx & Spencer - and -ITV -
Sources say Jones was a frantic--when the golden television girl agreed during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements -- worth up to 1.5 million pounds -- meaning that she had no longer the enough time to commit to their petrol brands and accessors--ruly.
The business was compared to Gwynth Paltrow brand and was predicted to double its estimated assets at 11 million pounds.
As Willoughby, 37, turned to the Instagram to declare her departure from - Truly - Jones has flown outside Britain to one of his vacation homes.
One source is expressed: -Truly was undoubtedly at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It would be her long - term future to accompany her over the decades to come.
Her decision to withdraw left all persons involved absolutely in awe.
No one could believe what was happening on Thursday, it was so close to the opening.
There's a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold in Marlow's offices--
Experts think that leaving the host of Thhis Morning - which is among the most successful British stars, can cost the firm millions, due to considerable investment in products starting from pillows and candles to home dress and furniture, and cause further delays in its opening.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
Wloughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Wloughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones has 40 per cent stake in the Baldwin television production firm.
Wloughby is expected to become M&S' ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the --I'm A Celebrity -- a ITV.
Last evening, a source near Jones has been expressed-- we don't want to comment on his business business business business matters--
We had a hard conversation and then fell in love.
He made a joke about the criticism he would receive from the news media because of a comment that some would consider to be unworthy of a president - and because of the positiveness of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said by mocking the voice of news speakers.
- I did not give up at all -
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting, as their first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step towards disconnecting North Korea.
But the negotiations for disengagement have been interrupted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ring Ho, has been addressed to world leaders at the UN General Assembly Saturday, saying Veriu sees no corresponding re-reactions - from the US to the first steps taken by North Korea for disparaging.
On the contrary, he says, the US is continuing sanctions aimed at holding pressure.
Trump took a far more optimistic view of his rally talk.
- The things are getting better with North Korea; he has said.
- We were entering the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a fine relationship
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results - breaking missile testing, aiding the release of hostages, and returning home to the rest of the US military.
In his speech about Kim's relations, he defended his unusual approach.
- It's very easy to behave as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overwhelmed arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there -- Trump said, pointing towards the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
After the quake in Lombok, for example, foreign nonprofit organizations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population, no national catastrophes were proclaimed, which constitute prerequisite for the catalisation of international aid.
Sadly, they have made it in many clear cases that they do not seek international support, so the issue is a bit challenging -- Mrs. Sumbung said.
While -- Save the Children's -- has set up a team to travel to Paul, it is still not known whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were praising the situation in Paulu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
In view of the frequent fluctuations of the land that Indonesia faces, the country remains extremely unprepared in the face of natural anger.
While shelters against tsunami have been built in Aceh, they are hardly met in other coastal areas.
The evident absence of a syrenae for warning the tsunami in Paulu, despite a warning being issued, is likely to have contributed to the loss of lives.
Even in better conditions, travelling through the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital vessel that was stationed in Lombok for dealing with earthquake victims is traveling to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo used the improvement of Indonesia's lame infrastructure as the focal point of his election campaign, and has invested generous amounts of money for roads and railways.
But funding shortages have upset Mr. Joko's administration while he is facing the new elections that will take place next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressures from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands have moved from their homes following the impact of Christian and Muslim groups on the street, where hans, bows, and arrows have been used, and other cold weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool marks in the last few minutes a drawback goal against Chelsea
Daniel Storridge saved Liverpool from a loss at Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Strybridge received a pass from Gerdan Saqiri at some 30 yards away from the Chelsea gate, while his team was losing 1-0.
He pushed the ball lightly to his left before making a blow to the remote gate.
The ball flew over the area until it deviated to the upper corner of the net.
The ball escaped the air dance of Kepa Arrizabalga and ended up in the net.
- The aim was to put myself in the right position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play with the balls ahead, so I tried to create myself as long as possible -- Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
- I saw Kante coming, I checked the ball with a touch, and I didn't think too long, but I just hit--
Chelsea led the 1-0 score in the first half, following a goal in the 25th minute by the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker made a reassemblement to Mateo Kovac during that game, before it rolled near the field and sprinted towards the Liverpol semifusa.
Kovac made a quick combination in the midfield.
Then he gave a beautiful vertical pass that brought Hazard to the area.
Hazard switched his back to the duel speed, and with a blow to the left he scored on the second column, passing the ball behind the wings of Liverpool goalman Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the phase of the Champions League groups on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face videoton in the European League UEFA on Thursday at 3: 00 p.m. in London.

Cromwell's statue in Parlament, the latest monument affected by debate over the history-rescription -
Its removal would be a deserved punishment for the Talibanesk destruction of many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts on the part of his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as - taken and - attempt to rewrite history -
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: “At the middle of the current debate regarding the removal of the statues, it was inevitable the protection of Oliver Cromwell's image outside Westminster's Palace.
The Iconoklasm of English civil wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Maybe this would be a sacrifice of Cromwell wrong for his predecessor Thomas's actions in the last century.
The excellent Portretization of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure which many think still deserves to be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith said: (The Sunday Telegraph) \"Most people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, viewed Cromwell as a protector of parliament from outside pressure, of course, was monarchy in his case.
The fact that this is a fully accurate portrayal is the object of continuing historical debates.
What's certain is that the 17th-century conflict shaped the form of further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a known individual figure representing one side of that medal.
Its achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated -
Killer pig wounds Chinese farmer to death
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname - Yuan - was found lifeless with a circumsted artery and covered in blood next to a pig slave in the Liupanshiu market in the province of Guizou, reported--South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer becomes ready to inject pig vaccines in a stlat on May 30th 2005, in the Kunghai province's Xing, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring province Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning his cousin found him lifeless and discovered the door of a pig slab nearby.
He said there was a big male pig in the stable with the mouth of blood.
A medical examination has confirmed that pig 550 pounds have injured the farmer to death, according to the report.
- My cousin's feet were bloody and crippled-- said his cousin identified by his surname--Wu - as mentioned in the evening news in Guyang.
On footage filmed by the security camera, Yuan is seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager has confessed to the news of the pig's evening that he was kept in solitary confinement to prevent any other attack, while police collected evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Though rare, cases of people being attacked by pigs have been recorded before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing a man to suffer severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig grabbed a rancher to his tractor until his wife evicted the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that usually, pigs are not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as niquisite -
- They just want to play.
They're such a curious little girl... their purpose isn't to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right respect,\" he said.
The consequences of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring major stretched rainfall to the southwest of the United States
As foretold, the power of Hurricane Rosa is melting as it moves toward the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, during the following days, Rosa will cause floods in northern Mexico and the southwest US.
On Sunday, at 5 o’clock in the morning, Rosa was accompanied by speeding winds of 85 miles per hour, classing as a hurricane of Category 1, and located 385 miles in southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The duck is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a region of low atmospheric pressure is starting to develop over the Pacific ocean, which is moving towards the East, towards the West Coast of the US.As Rosa is expected to approach the Baya California peninsula on Monday in the thickness of a tropical storm, it will continue to push great tropical moisture towards its north, towards the southeastern US.
On Monday, Rossa will cause rains of up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico.
Then, the interaction of tropical moisture with low - pressure, atmospheric pressure zones will cause heavy rainy rainfall in the Southwest during the following days.
On the local level, rainfall at a height of 1 to 4 inches will cause immediate flooding, waste leaks and possible land slides in the desert.
The high tropical tranquility will give rise to approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of Nevada and South Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rainfall are predicted in some areas of the Southwest, mainly above much of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of immediate flooding with rapid deterioration of conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
Because of the danger of tropical rainfall, you are not advised to wander through the desert on foot.
The heavy downfalls can turn the canyons into powerful rivers, and the storms will bring strong winds and dust storms into the area.
Approaching the region with low weather pressure will bring large rainfall to some parts of the southern coast of California.
Total levels of rainfall can reach over half inch, which can cause small waste leaks and slippery roads.
For the region, these will be the first rainfall of the rain season.
Several scattered tropical rainfalls will start approaching Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, before rainfall is expanded wider on Monday and Tuesday evenings.
Strong downfalls will be distributed on all four sides Tuesday and will continue through Wednesday.
Thetor in the U.S. may be marked by high temperature fluctuations, with a decline in Arctic, while the Tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes of temperatures in short distances.
A good example is the drastic difference of temperatures across the central US on Sunday.
Between the city of Kansas in Missouri and Omahas in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
During the following days, the remaining summer heat will try to accumulate and expand again.
A good part of the Central and East US is expected to start October with warm temperatures, with an average of 80, from South Fields to certain parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, the temperature, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows high chances for temperatures on the average in the eastern US during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have attended Bret Kavanaugh's court hearing
Over 20 million people have followed through six television networks the interesting testimony of High Court candidate Brett Kavanaug and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political blockade continued, and broadcasters interrupted regular programmes to transmit the recent turnout of Friday's events -- an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for conducting a week-long investigation by the FBI on charges.
Ford said before the Senate Judicial Committee that it is 100 per cent sure that Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and had tried to break him to a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a volatile testimony, said it was 100 per cent sure that this had not happened.
The number of followers likely was greater than the 20.4 million, reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was measuring average cBS syncivity, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News channel and MSNBC.
The figures for other broadcast networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen has usually problems counting viewers from offices.
To put this figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a soccer elite or that of Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose opinionists have strongly backed the appointment of Kavanaugh, led other networks with an average of 5,69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
ABC was second in place with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest continued to remain high even after the completion of the hearing.
Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as he faced the screams of protesters while trying to board the elevator to go to the trial hearing of the Judicial Committee.
In CNN's broadcast, he appeared with his eyes down for several minutes as he was reproved.
He said, “I am standing right here in front of you.
- Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
It was said to him: \"For you there is power and power, but there are so many free women.\"
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door was closed, he said there would be more to say during the committee session.
A few hours later, all cable and satellite networks were directly covering the moment when the Judicial Committee would vote for the passage of Kavanaugh's candidacy for the vote before all members of the Senate.
But Flake said he would do it only with the belief that the FBI would investigate charges against candidate during the following week, as the Democrat minority had sought.
Flake was partly convinced by discussions with his friend, democrat Senator Chris Conons.
After a conversation with Coons and with several other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was smart, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting the investigation.
President Trump has sought the opening of an investigation by the FBI on charges against Kavanaug.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics that he is playing political games - with Brexit

Volcan shed favor over Mexico’s city
Hyri from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was reinstated and 183 gas and ashes launches were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre had monitored a series of disasters and turbulence.
Images in social media showed thin amounts of ashes that covered car glass in some neighbourhoods of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have found an increase in the activity of the volcano, which stands at 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, since a 7,1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan known as - Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of independence votes
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-independence clash with the peacekeeping police forces, while thousands have joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalanje polarising vote for secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by the peacekeeping forces, struck with eggs and painted puddles by creating dark dust clouds on roads that usually devour from tourists.
Later in the day there was a cover, and the police had to use rubber chopsticks to end the crashes.
For a few hours in a row, repeating the wig. We don't forgive. The pro-independence groups were confronted with unyonists yelling--il Spain-
Fourteen people were treated for light wounds received during the protests, according to local press reports.
In the region where the feelings are dominated by independence, tensions remain high another year after the 1 October referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist catalists.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite turnout being low, as citizens against secession boycotted the polls.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people remained injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations in the region through violent clashes.
Friday night, pro-independence groups set up camps out to prevent a demonstration in support of national police.
Demonstrat continued, but was forced to get another flow.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest together with his wife, said he no longer had expectations that Catalana would gain independence in the future.
- Last year, we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy that they would be able to vote, but now we're stuck,\" he said.
Despite the recent December local elections reached a vital victory, though, with narrow results, pro-independence Catalist parties have found it hard to preserve hovin this year, as many of their most recognised leaders have either been voluntarily removed from the country or are in detention and pending judgment for their role in organising the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who was registering the protest on his phone in aid to the police, said the conflict was fed by politicians of both sides.
- The situation is becoming increasingly tense, he said.
On Saturday, Oril Junqueras, one of the nine catalyst leaders in prison pending the trial since the end of last year, said he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
- The European election candidacy's move is the best way to counter the reform of democratic values and the repression we have been made by the Spanish government - he said.

The incident occurred in Balynagard Crescent on Thursday, about 1:30 BST.

Menga Hit on Livingston 1-0 against Ranges
Dolly Menga Gole for Livingston won the victory
The team came from a category below, Livingston surprised Rangers, prompting Steven Gerard's second loss on 18 matches as team coach from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's strike proved crucial, while Gary Hold's team equaled second-place Hibernian point.
Gerard's team has not yet won an outdoor meeting in Premiership, this season and next Sunday, they will face Hearts, the gap with which is eight points.
But before, Rangers will be waiting at home Rapid Wienna, in the valid match for the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended the success series to six meetings, and coach Holt has not yet experienced the loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses occasions in the face of undecided opponents
Holt's team should have taken advantage of many minutes before marking, as their direct attacks caused Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but hit poorly at the gate, while then Alan Lithgow struck off on the upscale after having head-to-headed pass by Craig Halket.
The locals were willing to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause trouble in standard shocks.
And so was the goal that set the meeting.
Rangers caused a crackdown and Livingston created space.
By that moment, Rangers had dominated the ball, but local defence had resulted in in inadequacy and portry Liam Kelly had never been put to the test,
This game course went on in the second, even though Alfred Morelos forced Kelly to make a reception.
Scott Pittman's strike stood by the porter of Rangers Allan McGregor, while Lithgow struck off from another standard hit by Livingston.
Harvest constantly came to the Livingston area and was repeatedly purged, while two counts of penalty - following Halket's intervention to the coming player as replacement Glenn Midleton, and another hand-hand contact was not taken into consideration.
'Fenomal' game by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scottland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and phenomenal outcome for Livingston.
For a man, they played fine and continued to exceed expectations in this upbringing course.
The style of the game and their team hasn't changed much since their return to the top, but a major credit belongs to the Holt for how he electrified the team since it arrived.
He had many heroes.
Captain Hawkent was outstanding, leading a perfectly organised protection, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Wallarle in trouble throughout the match.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they have played very well under Gerard’s direction in some cases, they lacked quality.
The final absence -- only once managed to pass opposing protection--and that's something that needs to serve as an alarm to Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Expects Duplicated Feels in Colony
Saturday (September 29th) was marked by smiling and blue heavens as Turkey and Germany's leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at regulating relations between NATO allies.
They have fallen into conflict with issues like human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Later, Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city accommodates the largest number of Turkish populations outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police banned a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters went on the roads around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurdish - also raised their voice to condemn both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposition protests reflect the divisive ability of a visitor worshiped as a hero by some Turks of Germany and despised as autocrats from others.
Road accident in Deptford: Chylist dies after collision with the car
A cyclist has found death after crashing into a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crossroads of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a traffic route loaded at Deptford, southeast of town, about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics came immediately, but the victim changed lives in the scene.
The clash occurred several months after another cyclist lost his life in an accident where the author left the scene, which occurred in Childrens Street, about a mile away from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan police said the officers were working to identify the person and inform his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have been announced to use other routes, while motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Prison Long High: Six wounded officers during a rebellion
Six prison officers have remained injured during a riot in a men's high security prison, the Burgun Office has been expressed.
Rebellion erupted at HMP Long High at Worstershire about 09:30 BST on Sunday, and still continues.
The лrnado specialists have been summoned to control the riots, including eight prisoners and confined to one side of the prison.
Officers have received treatment at the scene for a few minor wounds in the face.
An spokesman for the Prison Service said: \"The specialised Pensonel of the Prison is mobilised to keep the incident currently taking control of the HMP Long High.
Six staff members have received treatment for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that the responsible persons will refer to the police and may receive prolongments of prison sentence -
HMP Long Martin hosts over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison director was reportedly subject to treatment at the hospital after an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, police officers from the peacekeeping forces were summoned to jail to keep a serious situation in check, where the staff was attacked with billboard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate flooding (which could make advantage of drought areas)
While it rarely happens that a tropical depression strikes Arizona, it is likely that the first days of next week, as the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa passes through the Southwest Desert, spreading immediate flood dangers.
The Meteorological National Service has already issued immediate flood warnings for Monday's day and Tuesday from Western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix cities, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rossa is expected to take the lead in Phoenix on Tuesday, nearing Monday's late hours with rainfall.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix stated on one tweet that by only -ty tropical cyclones have received the status of the storm or tropical depression in a ray of 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles [40 km] from the border of Arizona -
The latest models of the National Tornado Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of decline, with an isolated amount of up to 6 inches at the Arizona Mongolon border.
In other areas of the desert in the Southwest, including central Rockies and the Great Basen, the clouds are expected to be at 1 to 2 inch, while in isolated areas their total could reach 4 inches.
For areas outside the danger of immediate floods, Rosa's rainfall may be a blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
While floods pose a serious concern, some of these rainfall may be beneficial, as the southwest is currently facing droughtal conditions.
According to the American Centre for Stories of Thai, slightly more than 40 per cent of Arizona is facing extreme droughts of the second category - waether.com reported.
Initially, the Rosa hurricane will hit the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
The duck, still with hurricane power on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing cold waters over the Pacific and is thus losing power.
Consequently, hurricanes are expected to strike Mexico with tropical storms or Monday evenings.
Rainfalls over certain areas of Mexico may be strong, presenting considerable dangers for the flood.
— Rainfalls of an average level of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Bay California to Northwest Sonora and can reach 10 inches - reported weather.com.
Then Rossa will move north across Mexico, in the form of a tropical storm, before it reaches the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
- The main danger expected by Rosa or its consequences are the strong floods in Baja California, Northwest Sonora, and the southwestern US Desert, the National Bridges Centre, the U.S.A., said.
These floods are expected to cause immediate life - threatening floods, waste leaks in deserts, and landslides on mountainous grounds.

Trump says Cavanaugh - facing degradation and heart - of the Democratic Party
- A pro-jump vote of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and cruel tactics of the Democratic Party -- Trump said at a rally in West Virginia's Wheeling.
Trump said Cavanaugh - faced with humiliation and heart - of the Democratic Party during the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying with conviction and emotion on Christine Blasey Ford's charge that he had assaulted him sexually decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness during the hearing on her charge.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day the American people witnessed the greatness, qualities of character, and courage — of Kavanaugh.
- A pro-declaration vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most thoughtful jurists of our time, a lawyer with a record of public service -- he said before the crowd of supporters in western Virginia.
The president cited Cavanaugh's appointment indirectly during the speech on the importance of the republican participation in the medium-term elections.
- Weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I will not run, but I am contributing.
- That's why I'm making so much effort and fighting for excellent candidates -
Trump argued that the Democrats have been mission to make blockade-staffing assistance --
The first major procedure vote by Senate on the appointment of Kavanaug is expected to take place no later than Friday day, the assistant of a high-ranking GOP leader has told CNN
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, while figures are expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were consumed by the huge waves that crashed on the beaches when Indonesia's Sulawes island was hit by an earthquake and tsunami, authorities told the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Paul on Friday, when waves of up to six feet (18 m) crashed to the shore at dusk, devouring the deaths of many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5.
On the other day, when the threat of tsunami arose, people were still performing their usual activities on the beach, and the subsequent event did not run immediately and his victim fell — he said at a news conference about Sutopo Purwo Nougho, the spokesman for the Indonesian disaster prevention agency.
-Counam did not come alone, he took cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on the ground - said Nogroho, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800km/h (497 miles per hour) before it hit the coastline.
Some went up into the tree to save the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Peru.
Air photographs published by the disaster agency featured a series of destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a glass surrounded by water.
The aftermath of the quake continued to shock the coastal city on Saturday.
The rate of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Technology Application (BPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by Friday's massive earthquake was about threefold the power of the atomic bomb thrown in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical position of the city, located at the tip of a long, narrow bay, may have multiplied the strength of the tsunami, he said.
Nguroho described the damage as a major one — and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls, and hotels had collapsed.
Some corpses were found trapped under the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had remained injured and 29 had disappeared.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage rate can be much higher along the 300km (190 km) coastline in the north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the quake epicenter.
The networks of communication were completely interrupted from Donggala, Nugroho said.
That area has over 300,000 inhabitants -- the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and its volunteers were traveling to affected areas.
- This has already turned into a tragedy, but the situation can worsen even more.
On Saturday, the agency was sharply criticised because it had not announced the crackdown on Paul by the tsunami, despite the officials saying the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage distributed in social media, a man on the top floor of a building may be heard warning by passersby on the way down for the coming tsunami with furious cries.
Within a few minutes, a wave crashes to the shore, bringing with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the film.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power cut, which cut off communications across Palu, making it difficult to co-ordinate the efforts for rescue by the authorities.
The military has started sending cargo aircraft with aid from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but evacuated persons continue to have great needs for food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has been reopened for rescue efforts and will remain closed by October.
President Joko Widodo was expected to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims from the tsunami in Indonesia amounts to over 800.
The situation is pretty heavy.
While World Vision staff from Dongala has arrived safely in the town of Palu, where employees are accommodated in tarpaulin shelter (ravated hair) in the courtyard of their office, they witnessed disaster scenes along the way, Mr. Dosebba said.
They told me that they had seen many destroyed houses, he said.
The situation is pretty heavy.
While relief groups began serious efforts to operate humanitarian aid mechanisms, some complained that foreign aid workers with broad expertise were being barred from traveling to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and foreign staff can begin circulating only if the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
- This is still a regional disaster - said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
- Before the government says `O.K., this is a national disaster - we can seek national assistance, but this status has not yet been granted -
On the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palau, friends and family of missing persons still had hopes that the case of their loved ones would be of few miracles that ever occur in the event of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a well.
On Saturday, rescue forces released a woman who had been left under the rubble with her mother’s corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team, had trained two of the missing parachutes for the Asian Games, which were closed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the people trapped in the Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandaghi, were his students.
- Like an old parachute prosthetic, I am very emotionally charged - he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in the hours following the circulation of the hotel collapse of the hotel--Roa Roa--between the parachutism community, he had desperately tried to write to the WhatsApp competitors from Paulu, who were attending the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, ended up with only one sign of gray escalation, instead of two colored signs.
- I think that this meant no messages were sent.

Kanoye West: Repurch changes name in Yee
The Kenye Westman will change his name to Ye.
Declaring the difference on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: - officially known as Canye West -
The 41-year-old West has been called with the Yue nickname for a long time, and used it as the title of its eighth album, which appeared on the market in June.
The change has come shortly before his appearance at Saturday Night Lives, where he is expected to present his new album -Yandhi -
He will replace singer Aryana Grades in the play, which cannot come for emotional reunion, said the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviated by his current name of art, West has stated in the past that the word has a religious significance for him.
- I think it's--ye - it's the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means - [it's] West has said earlier this year, talking about the title of his album with the radio editor Big Boy.
- So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
I went from Kaneye, which means--the only one--the one -- that's reflecting our good, of our evil, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than a reflection of what we are.
He is one of many celebrities who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known differently as Puff Daddy, P. Deeddy or Deeddy, but this year he said he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-chairman, JAY-Z, has done what he did with or without a divisive visa and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has pledged that he would never use military forces against civilians, while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reaction against students.
On Saturday at Telolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador pledged that he would never use the army to suppress the Mexican people--
On October 2, 1968, the troops of the military set fire on peaceful demonstrators in the square, killing a total of 300 people at a time when the left movements of students were setting off throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youths by giving their students monthly subsidies and by opening up more public universities without charge.
He has indicated that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education pushes young people towards criminal gangs.
US must double financing for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US must double the amount spent on research in this area, says artificial intelligence investor and intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments have come after various parts of the US government have announced discoveries of artificial intelligence, despite the US lacking a general official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plan last year: within 2030, it aims to take the first place for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
-Displaying the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, since other countries are still well behind the US and we're looking for great next discovery in this area -- Lee said.
Doubled financing may double the chances of reaching the next major in the field of artificial intelligence being done in the US, Lee said in an interview for CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book entitled artificial Intelligence Skills: China, Silicon Valley and New World Rest -- released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is executive director of Sinovay Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, at the University -Carnegie Mellon - he created an artificial intelligence system that even passed to the leading American player in Othelo, and then worked as executive director near Microsoft Research and as president of the Google branch in China.
Lee congratulated the former American government's competitions for technology, such as the Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects, and asked when the next contest would be held in order to help identify new visionaries.
Lee said that often, researchers in the US have to work hard to get grants from the government.
- It's not China that's repelling academic leaders; it's corporations - Lee said.
Over the past few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired shiny minds from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes to immigration policy can help the US spur its efforts on the field of artificial intelligence.
- I think green cards should be automatically given to people with the doctor in the field of artificial intelligence - he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued the New Artificial Intelligence General Plan.
The National Foundation for Nature Sciences in China offers funding for persons in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations provide money for American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Early this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, which is expected to include partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the establishment of the Executive Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
Meanwhile, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called -Al-Next -
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100m a year for research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, US legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not found implementation for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on country name change
On Sunday, Macedonia's people voted in a referendum to decide whether its name will be changed in -Republic of North Macedonia - a move which can resolve a ten-year dispute with Greece, which had blocked its efforts for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, thinks its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim on its territory, and has placed its veto blocking membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change could compromise the ethnic identity of most Slavs of Macedonia's population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has voiced that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has questioned whether voter turnout will reach the 50 per cent necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum vote reads: \"Are you pro-EU and NATO membership through the agreement's accession to Greece-
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia, this is a price worth paying to achieve membership in structures like the EU and NATO.
- I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the European Union's umbrella, as that means a safer life for all of us -- 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska said in Skopje.
Although the referendum does not have binding powers, a sufficient number of MPs have indicated they will adhere to the outcome of the vote to make it crucial.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities were reported until 1:00 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections of 2016, where 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
- I came to vote for the sake of my children, we belong in Europe - said Djose Tanevski, 62, voters in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zarica and his son Dusko cast their vote in the referendum on changing Macedonia's name, which would pave the way for the country's NATO membership and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Facing parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scene and was setting up chairs in front of tents set up by referendum boycotters.
-We are the pro-NAs and the EU, but we want to join the head up, not by going through the back door - Kavadarkov said.
- Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us by the name of Macedonia, we can address other states like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration --
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investments to Macedonia, which has a degree of unemployment of more than 20 per cent.
- I think the vast majority will be the pro, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are the pro-EU and NATO - Zaev said after his vote was cast.
He said that a positive result would corroborate our future
According to a poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, about 30 per cent to 43 per cent of voters would participate in referendum - a figure below the necessary level of participation.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television Telma found that 57 per cent of participants were planning to vote Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent indicated they would vote pro.
For a successful referendum, the turnout rate should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
Failure of the referendum would give the first strong blow to the pro-Western government policy since its coming ruling in May of last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through all Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling stood up to all Brighton's defense at the 2-0 victory of Manchester City on Saturday, at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Augustero made his goal in the 65th minute look extremely easy.
The Argentine shooter received a pass in midfield at the start of the action.
He snapped through the three Brighton defenders, before he got on the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He overcome a defender and passed on to the duel of several others at the entrance of the Brighton area.
Then he followed the left where Sterling was located.
The English striker used his appearance into the area to succeed the Agueros ball, which hit with the right hand and crossed goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by throwing the ball in the right corner of the net.
- Augustero is suffering from a problem with her legs - the manager of City, Pep Guardiola, told reporters.
- We knew he would play about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial advantage of Premier League's match.
This goal was marked in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball into Brightton's semifusa.
He's vertically verticaled on Laroy Sane's left arm.
Sane advanced some steps before she followed Sterling to the second column.
The blue striker took the ball into the net and then slipped off restrictive lines.
City will face Hofenheim in the valid challenge for the phase of the Champions League groups on Thursday at 12:55 pm at Rhein-Necar-Erena in Sinseim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to preserve the role of --uniquischers-- against Rockies
With Nationals eliminated from the chance to achieve the elite, there was no reason to impose another beginning.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given the opportunity to score against Colado Rockies, but only if there is the likelihood of the playoffs for Rockies, who have an advantage of a match against Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of West.
Rockies reached at least one opportunity for payoff, thanks to winning 5-2 to Nationals on Friday evening, but are still trying to get the division title.
- Although we are playing without any motives, at least we can note knowing the atmosphere of fans here in Denver but and the fact that the rival team will play at the highest level against which we can face throughout the year.
Why did I not wish to play such a challenge?
Nationals have not yet announced who will be the title on Sunday, but reportedly be inclined to leave Scherzer in such situations to begin the meeting.
Scherzer, who would be the presentation of 34 as the title, conducted a training session Thursday and could appear in the field on Sunday, which could be a normal vacation day for him.
The player from Washington, who shoots with his right is 18-7 with an ERA 2,53 ERA and 300/strikeouts - at 220/3 shooting this season.
Bramp collects West Virginia in Mitting
The president referred indirectly to the situation about his choice of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, before talking about the importance of the republican participation in the medium-term elections.
- The subscription is crucial for everything we have done so far.
Five weeks separate us from one of our most important choices.
This is one of the biggest elections -- I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so hard to fight for excellent candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued, - You see this horrific group of radical democrats, you see what's going on at this moment.
And they've agreed to reclaim power in any way, you see the humiliation of their uncleanness.
They don't care who's hurt, who's pressing to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, have been missioned to make blockade-suits.
He said, ‘You have seen this during the last days, calling them the Democrats wrathful, evil, unclean, disloyal.’
He referred to the Chief Democrat of the Senate Judicial Committee, Diane Feinstein, which sparked discontent from the audience.
- Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I... wait a minute-- - Her body tongue was quite bad--it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Working party is no longer an open one-kiss--
She's untolerant about what they say.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted the no-confidence motion against me, I wasn't even surprised.
After all, I'm not the first of the Employees' Party of Labour MPs to whom they are told not welcome - all of this because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was similarly treated simply because he firmly opposed antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of distrust was a criticism against me for failing to agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security and Europe, ironically similar issues for which Jeremy clashed with former leaders.
Reporting on the collection of the Nottingham East Labour Party said that--we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive
For most of my eight-year period as the local deputy of the Labour Party, the GC meetings have been just like that.
Unfortunately, the meetings no longer have their previous tone, and the promise of a more gentle and courteous policy, has long been forgotten if ever there was.
It has become increasingly evident that the contrary views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is judged on the basis of its aptitude by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, while colleagues with whom I thought that I shared similar political views began claiming that I would take an 180-degree turn and maintain positions that I would by no means agree -- on national security or on the only EU market.
Every time I speak in public -- no matter what I say -- the criticism in social media erupts, with people seeking my dismissal, denouncing the centre policies, they tell me I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And that's not just me.
I am aware that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be of political nature.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of colleagues facing gender and racial discrimination every day, but they do not Tutten.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalisation of the levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Labour Party should feed a tolerance culture.
In reality, we are no longer an open one - and every motion of faith and any change to the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly closed.
Over the past two years, I have often been instructed to bow down, not to be so loud, and that everything will be fine--
But that's not why I entered politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as school students, prompted by the inconsistency of Thitcher's government that led to my class failure in a general school, I have tried to play for better public services for those who need it most -- be a member of a local council or as government minister.
I've never hid my policy, even in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had cleared my political positions and points of opposition to the current leadership.
For all those who voted for the motion Friday, I just want to say that the country is heading towards a Brexite that will affect our families, businesses and public services, I can't understand the desire to spend time and energy with my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I want to convey does not address Nottingham Momentum, but my electors, whether or not of the Labour Party: I am proud to be in your service and I promise you that no threat to dismiss or political favor will prevent me from acting in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the deputy of Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrosee: Unimpressed form tops the list
Two delayed efforts may have changed the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in the extraordinary fun match of Tenent's Premiership today.
Now they head the lists as the only invincible team of ten teams.
Finally, it was their wonderful defense and courage to take risks that assured the local team victory, and coach Peter Murchie had the right to be satisfied.
- We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still invincible, so normally I'm happy,\" he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: \"We want to congratulate the Ayr team, which undertook more dangers than we are:
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, turned goal by Frazier Climo, passed Ayr in the advantage, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes' player, came to this challenge from Warrior, allowed Melrose to display numerical superiority and Baggson received an unfried ball.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage with a penalty while shortly before the completion of the first part, he scored and turned a individual action into the goal, leading to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrosse started the second part well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, turned to go from Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Then, there was a long interruption as a result of Ruarandh Knott's serious damage, which left with a stretcher, and after the game's resumption, Ayr increased the result through a braphford McDowall attempt, marked by Climo.
Ally's captain, Blair Macpherson, was later punished with yellow cardboard, and Melross took back the fact that they had one more player, with an unabated attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a piece with severe expectations.
However, the locals returned, and when Striven Hutchinson was punished with yellow cardboard because it hampered Climo, without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made--touch don-- behind the back of the Ayr's (maul) havoc that was moving forward.
Climo scored and did the same after the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe seized the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and brought before the attack player (flanker) Gregor Henry, for the fifth attempt of the local team.

The star of Stille Game - Ford Kiera seems determined to enter the hotelry industry after it was found to have been appointed director of a licensed restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis's role in the famous BBC performance, with co-scientific and co-protagonist of his long-term partner in the world of comedy, Greg Hemphill.
The doubt has announced that the ninth season will be the last for this show, and it appears that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a source for Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was trying to get into Glasgow’s flourishing restaurants.
-Dett is ours - Bolivia without landing at sea hope the court opens its way to the Pacific
Mariners patrol an improvisation of the maritime fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have set up the blue ocean flag.
The Amazon lake of Titicaca is marked by motto: \"Deet is our property.
His repayment is a task.
In view of Bolivia without exit, memory of taking the coastline from Chile in a bloody conflict for resources during the 19th century is still quite alive - as well as the desire to sail once again across the Pacific Ocean.
Now, these hopes are more likely than ever were for decades, while on October 1st, Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's decision after a five-year review.
-Bolivia is characterized by hobbies, a spirit of unity, and calm, and of course, he is looking forward to the outcome - said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will attend the LND session on large displays across the country, hoping that The Hague's tribuneum will decide in favour of Bolivia - after decades of irregular discussions - Chile is obliged to hold talks to give Bolivia a sovereign territory of exiting the sea.
For Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia - who is in the face of a constant battle for receiving the second term in next year's election - Monday's decision is very important.
- We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean - he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts agree that the court is very unlikely to decide in favour of Bolivia - and that even if they were to change little.
The UN headquarters body in the Netherlands has not had the targrin to give another state part of Chile's territory, and has indicated that it will not put the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ND is making a decision just six months after hearing the final arguments, indicates that the issue was not complicated - said Paz Zárate, a cyber expert on international law.
And instead of helping Bolivia's cause, the events of the past four years may have penalized him.
- The issue of access to the sea has been compromised by the current Bolivian administration -- Záratetale said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has eliminated any trace of goodwill left in Chileans, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was surprisingly quick.
Monday's day will offer Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile - and a chance - to end differences 139-year-old, with mutual benefits -- he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America was using the maritime issue for political interests.
-Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific Ocean -- he added.
- The decision is an opportunity to find out that we should leave the past behind. -
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be carried out as long as it cannot trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Young Ho says his nation will by no means commit disarmament by nuclear weapons, as long as it cannot trust Washington.
Younger was giving a speech Saturday in front of the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of rival states.
His comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of reviving nuclear diplomacy so far - sleep - more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, hopes that the continued sanctions and opposition from the US to the announcement of the Korean War end will make North Korea kneel, are in vain.
As long as Pyongyang doesn't act first to make significant disarmament movements, Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a broad scepticism regarding the seriousness of Pyongyang's intention to attract his arsenal, which the country most likely views as the only way to ensure his safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion displays unearth the latest line of giant hats that will soon reach the streets of your city
If you want to enrich your hat collection or provide complete protection from the sunlight, do not further seek.
Stallers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of strange giant hats for their SS1 collection in the passover, which left with the mouth of all styles in Paris Week.
Extremely impractical hats have been taken into the Instagram this summer, and these designers have pedestrianed their surprising creations.
Valentino’s unique creation was an extremely extravagant bee hat adorned with a wide shelter with details similar to feathers, which surrounded the head of the model.
Other big accessors included stone-developed watermelons, a magician's hat and even a pineapple - but they were not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks - based on time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had stitched lips, and they resembled more like Hannibal Lecter than huture haute.
One creation resembled diving equipment, also filled with air pipe and water glasses, while another resembled a molten ice cream.
And if you like to follow this brave fashion - you're lucky.
Fashion analysts predict that giant hats can soon come to your town streets.
The trend of giant hats has followed that of the  —La Bomba - the hust hat with two large legs that we've seen all of them, starting from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Marka cult, hiding behind the extremely impractical hat that landed on social media, produced another major creation in the paerella - a straw bag, almost as large as the pattern of bathing clothes that was holding it.
The bright - orange raffle bag, decorated with raffles and a leather stick on top, was the most special creation of the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus in Fashion Week in Paris.
The style of famous personalities Luke Armitage told of FEMAIL: “The next day I project to see the hats and giant beach bags on the streets of the towns - the designer has left such a huge impact that the demand for large accessors would be hard to ignore -
John Edward: Language skills essential to global citizens
Private schools in Scotland keep the record for academic exclusion, and this has continued in 2018 with another line of excellent results in exams, further reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, and other fields.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools -- represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS) -- try to provide the highest level of service for students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education of the highest levels, for their elected career and country as global citizens.
As a educational sector that can draft and implement an adapted educational curricula, we are witnessing how the branch of modern languages continues to be a popular and popular choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘ If you talk to someone in a language that he understands, your words go to his ears.
If you speak to him in his own tongue, your speech will reach your heart.
Those words are a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to develop relationships with people from foreign lands.
From the results of this year's latest exams, we can conclude that languages are leading results lists, with the highest degree of passing grades among private schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who have studied foreign languages have received the maximum A grade.
The data, collected by 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 per cent of students had received the maximum A-A-language marks, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French, and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish had also received A grade.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the vital skills that will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future.
Currently, the foreign languages branch is considered as important as the STEM (scientific, technology, engineers and mathematics) branches in private schools and beyond.
A 2014 study by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills found that among the main challenges employers faced in meeting vacant countries, 17 per cent were linked to lack of linguistic skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming more and more necessary for preparing young people for their future careers.
With the addition of work that costs the possession of foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Despite a career that one chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future as possessor of such long - term capacity.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign people will automatically position a multilingual person on competitors.
According to a YouTube survey that included over 4000 adults raised by the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and the French was the only foreign language spoken by a 2 per cent figure, in particular 15 per cent.
This is why investment in learning languages is important for children today.
The mastery of many languages, and especially the possession of the languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different as to the languages taught in them.
Some schools will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will offer the languages considered most important for the United Kingdom in the prospect of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages you can choose in private schools, with professor staff made up of field specialists.
The Scottish private schools are committed to providing a school environment that will prepare children and subsidise them - those with the skills needed to succeed, however the future.
In these times, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital significance for the country's future, so that should be reflected in education.
Modern languages must indeed be regarded as the philanthropics of international communication -
Private schools will continue to provide this election, diversity and excision for the young of Scotland.
Il fauts fall off.
John Edward is Chairman of the Scottish Schools Council of Private

The time of Trump gatherings in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump launches a series of electrical gatherings this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first gathering of five such scheduled to be held next week, including stops in friendly areas involving Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the approval vote left pending for his selection to meet the empty country at the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create support for the upcoming mid-term elections, since the republics are at risk of losing control in Congress when the polls are conducted in November.
In what hour is Trump gathering held today in West Virginia, and how can we follow it online?
The Wheeling Tumpire, West Virginia, is scheduled to be held at 7: 00 p.m. Eastern Time this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow the Trump rally in West Virginia below, through direct transmission on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing sessions this week at Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court of Candidate Candidate, which was strained due to charges of indecent sexual behaviour, with the expected vote of confirmation by the remaining Senate confirmed for a week as the FBI conducted investigations of the case.
But the primary goal of these numerous gatherings is to help the republicans take a moment forward in facing the November elections.
Therefore, US President Trump's campaign staff said that these five gatherings in the next week are intended to provide energy to volunteers and supporters, as republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives - according to Reuters.
- Congress Control is so important to its agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible as we turn to the busy campaign season - a spokesman for the Trump campaign, which did not want to be identified, told Reuters.
Planned to take place in Wesbanco Arena at Wheeling, today's evening gathering may bring supporters from - Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pitsburgh media - according to the Western Virginia news agency.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republic of Senate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind the polls.
-It's not a good sign for Morrisy that the president should come and try to give him a push in the polls,\" said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: The US team showed willingness to fight while hoping for living by turning to tech contests Sunday
After three unilateral seasons, the remaining four for Sunday afternoon may be what Ryder Needed.
This wave of momentum is a totally created sports concept, but a concept where players truly believe and never more than in such races.
But where can we say that this momentum is now feeling?
- They had a six-point break now to four, so we can say that some sort of momentum has been created, I believe - said Jordan Spieth as he closed the day.
Europe certainly has advantages of the four points ahead when left in play and twelve points.
As Spyth says, Americans hope the likelihood is in their favor and have a lot of things to be encouraged, in particular from Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together the whole day where they got three of the four points possible.
Spieth has been relentless since the start of shooting to the pit and is leading his example.
The cheers of the holiday were added as it followed round, introducing the golf ball with a slight blow to bring the match to a draw, when he and Thomas were two points down after two rounds.
His light shot to them gave the match victory in the 15th pit was met with a similar cheerful one, showing that he believes the US team is not yet out of the race.
-You just have to work hard and worry about your fight.
All the players left now.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Moliner and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple, has made four out of four and cannot err.
-Moliwood - was the only couple who didn't catch a kick on the minimum Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided shooting on the minimal even Sunday morning, Friday evening, and at nine strikes Friday morning.
This result and the way their energy seems to flow towards the excited crowd and the analysis reinforces the idea that they are the players to be defeated on Sunday day and that there will be no other player known than Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory, as the sun sets over--Lel Golf Naalion Naal.
Possibly both at the same time in different holes.
However, statements for a European triumph are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it very easy with Sergio Garcia, the hero of four morning games when he fell into a couple with Alex Knorr.
One point above the minimal and two at nine before they put the Spanish and Swedish in a hole where they had no chance of going out.
However, on Sunday no one will be there to help you get out of your pit.
Four and couples' games are so amazing to follow closely because of the interaction between couples, of the advice they give, of the advice they do not give, and of how a strategy can change for it.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead to the final, but these four-story sessions also showed that the US team will still face some people, especially Statside, have questioned that.
Europe tops 10-6 as it heads for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a substantial advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after leaving four games and couples with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspiring double of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Moliner led the two-winning race against a Tiger Woods found in trouble to increase their advantage at four points at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, offered to take the trophy that lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated on the helpless US team in double morning matches, bringing it to 3-1 series of results.
The American team showed more resistance to the four games, winning two matches, but they couldn't reduce the difference.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European player to have won four points in the round, while he and Moliner, engraved “Mollioud\" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair in the history of Cup Ryder, who win four points in their four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed on four, they combined well together to defeat an helpless Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more dramatic result of 54.
Woods, who grappled with two meetings Saturday, displayed occasional outbreaks of greatness, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 matches in the four and couples and 7 row games.
Justin Rose, fired for the four-hour morning match, returned to Henry Stanson's couples' game and received a loss of 2&1 from Dustin Justin and Brooks Kopka, ranked first and third in the world.
Europe did not have everything in favor of a beautiful and fresh day in the southwest of Paris.
Three times the professional Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas established the margin that was to be seized by Americans at two points Saturday.
They received a bold 2&1 victory against Spanish Ion Rahm and Ian Poulter in four matches and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in couples' matches after losing into the first two pits.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has turned the result after a four-point difference in individual games, even though Furyk's holder team needs only one draw to keep the trophy.
However, as it was the second best player for two days, an antidote on Sunday seems to go beyond their reach.
North Korea says it will not be disarmed ‘ in any way' unilaterally without gaining confidence
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the sanctions continued on Saturday were deepening the mistrust of cardiacness in the United States, and the country would not give up in any way its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ring Ho told the world’s annual body of the General Assembly that North Korea has undertaken - important measures showing good will - in the past year, such as the ban on nuclear and missile testing, dismantling areas where nuclear tests were held, and pledging that it would not increase the arsenal of weapons and nuclear technology.
(However, we are not seeing any answers to this from the U.S.)
- Without trusting in the US, our national security will have no self-confidence, and in these circumstances there is no way for us to unilaterally disarray ourselves first -
While Rij reiterated the usual complaints in North Korea regarding Washington's resistance to a divided approach - to the stage - for the nuclear disarmament process where North Korea would be evaluated because of its gradual steps, its statement seemed important because it did not rule out unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Penian has previously done.
Younger referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first-designate summit between an American president in office and Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, where Kim pledged to work towards the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula -- while a guarantee of the security of North Korea was pledged.
North Korea has requested an official outcome of the 1950-53 war, but the United States has voiced that Peniani must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften strict international sanctions on North Korea.
--The US insists that the \"ductive disarmament\" be originally carried out and increases pressure level through sanctions to achieve their goal compulsoryly, even rejecting 'disclaration of the end of the war,'' said Ri.
- The perception that sanctions can Kneel us are sunny dreams of people who are uninformed to us.
But the problem is that continuation of sanctions is deepening our distrust -
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement the US leader highlighted earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister underlined three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae, in the past five months and added: \"If the side on the nuclear disarmament issue were not to come to this situation without a breakthrough -- the process of nuclear disarmament in the Korean peninsula --
Despite this, the tone used in the New speech was deeply different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the deployment of the US territory targeted by Korean-verage missiles was inevitable after (Z. President Trump) called the Kym-Shunkunkunks - with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to completely subvert the North Korea thank Kim for the courage shown in taking steps for disarmament, but said there is still much work to do and that sanctions should continue to be active until North Korea conducts nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeframe for this, saying that--if it would take two years, three years or five months -- that doesn't matter--
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Penianan for the steps undertaken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: \"The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without ban until we realise the complete and final censible of nuclear disarmament -
The Security Council has unanimously imposed the increase in sanctions for North Korea since 2006, in an effort to end Penianan's nuclear and ballistic missile financing and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines at the UN General Assembly, and later said he would visit Penianan again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go much better.
He left Penianan in July, saying there was progress, and only within a few hours of North Korea denounced him for accomplishing — mafioso - style requests -
North Korea pledged a meeting with Moon this month to disarmament a missile area and also a nuclear complex if the United States will undertake corresponding sizes -
He said that Kim had told him that the corresponding measures -- which he sought -- were security guarantees for which Trump pledged in Singapore and the movement towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students get lectures on how to fire enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has included all students to sleep more, in an effort to fight the growing culture of ‘ machove' of study through the use of coffee from these 'unsolved.'
One academic observed that university students number one in the world often have no knowledge when it comes to more basic things than to how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Brigham Hospital and that of the Women, prepared the course of lectures, who believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to launch this course after giving a reference to the effect of sleep deprivation to learning.
'At the end of him, a girl approached me and said to me, 'Why is this thing telling me now, in my last year?'
She said that no one had ever spoken to her before about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me,'' he said to The Telegraph.
The course, included in the programme for the first time this year, explains to students the necessary elements how customs of a good sleep help academic and athletic productivity, and also how it improves their welfare in general.
Paul Barreyra, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of university medical services, said the university decided to present this course after it found that students were seriously deprived of sleep over the week.
The course that lasts an hour includes a series of interactive tasks.
On one side is a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee filters, curtains, athletes and books so that they can explain the effects of café and lighting and how athletic productivity is affected by sleep shortages, as well as the importance of the routine of hours spent in bed.
In another part, participants are explained to how long - term sleep deprivation increases the risks of heart attacks, teemia, depression, and cancer.
A camp map, with interactive icons, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know, the health impact when choosing to smoke,\" Prof added.
The culture of pride to spend the ‘ night of sleep ’ continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and growing pressure on students meant that deprivation from sleep was a growing problem.
The assurance that you have taken sufficient dosage of sleep, of a good quality, should be the ‘ secret weapon ’ of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid increasing weight because sleep deprivation leads the brain into a hunger mode, making them feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who studied physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler in preparing the course, having participated in one of his class classes last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to turn him into a course for the entire camp.
He hopes the next step, is to ask all postgraduate studies students to complete a similar research programme before joining competitive institutions.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students need to set an hour with bells that when they have to go to bed, and also that when they have to wake up, and be aware of the damaging effects of ‘ blue ’ that emerges from the electronic screens and LED lighting, which can get the biological pace out of sleep, which leads to trouble at the sound of sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga marks against Gerard's boys
Rangers took another blow as a visitor as the hit by Dolly Menga gave the disbanded side of Steven Gerard lost 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was seeking to register his first victory since February 4-1th in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerard's second defeat in 18 games as coach, leaving his team eight points behind the fugitive leader of Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts team.
Mega scored seven minutes before the first piece was completed and with an establishment of the Ranger team that seemed completely powerless to equalize.
As Rangers now falls to sixth place, Livingston climbs third and is directly behind Hibernia for golfings.
Rangers may expect to have more trouble after their wing player Calum Spence was treated for a blow to the head after being hit by an object likely thrown by visitors fans.
Gerard conducted eight changes to his team, which passed Air to the semifinals of the Betfrid Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, introduced the same 11th field that grabbed a point Hearts last week and that he would feel satisfied with the way his well-organized team chokes opponents in every round.
Rangers may have dominated the hold of the ball, but Livingston created more when he had it in possession.
They should have only marked two minutes from the start of the meeting, when the first pass that Menga gave to Scott Pittman on the framework of the protected gate from Allan McGrego was not properly exploited by him by throwing the ball out.
A long time from Keaghan Jacobs' sentence shot at Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defense, Alan Lithgow, just shot him out on the back of the gate.
Ringers took over the game, but it seemed that they were more hoping than they really believed in their game in the opposing area.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a criminal after a quarter-hour game while he and Steven Lawlesses crashed, but arbitrary Steven Thomson did not hear Colombian complaints.
Rangers managed to carry out two kicks at the gate in the first part, but Ibrox's former reporter Liam Kelly was not disturbed by the head attack of Lasana Colibality and by Ovie's unpowered assault.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have been at odds with what was being seen in the field, but no one can deny that they deserved only the quarrel they showed.
Again Ringers failed in the long past service for Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball towards Scott Robinson, who maintained calm to cross Menga and mark in a simple way.
Gerard acted at rest among the parts as he replaced Culibaly with Ryan Kent, and this change almost gave no immediate effect as the side followed for Morelos, but the impression Kelly ran from his position to block it.
But Livingston continued to make guests play as they wanted, where Lithgow and Halket followed one another long balls over and over again.
The Holt team could extend its lead to the final phase, but McGreg stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow shot out of a ball received by the cornershot.
Rangers' deputy, Glenn Midleton later claimed during the game for another penalty, while he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson allowed advantage.
Almanak: Geiger meter inventor
And now a page by our almanac of Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, as today 136 years ago and IN VAZHDIM... the day the next physicist Johannes Wilhelm-Hans - Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for the discovery and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the production of what is known as the Geiger meter.
A main pillar of science since then, measurer Geiger became a major pillar of popular culture, as in the 1950 film - Zoiles of Coronado - with an actress of seemingly unprofessional scientists such as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man: - What the hell is that?
Rogers: - It is a Geiger meter that is used to track radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you decide these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms that are released from radioactive to minerals -
Evans: - Don't tell me, I'm really listening to her now.
- Huns - Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention of his name continues to live.

They can “dwell\" a protein that is common to many types of cancer and then reinject
A vaccine that is tested is showing promising results in patients with certain types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to know the bad cells found that ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
Methods include extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them to a laboratory so that they can ‘ rule out a protein common in certain types of cancer called HER2, and then reinventing these cells.
Professor Jay Berzoffsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: \"Our results show us that we are dealing with a highly promising vaccine --
HER2 - increasing certain types of cancer - including breast cancer, ovarian, lungs, and intestines, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to the extraction of immune cells from patients - to teach - how to detect cancer cells, has worked in dealing with a kind of leukemia.
Kanoye West appeared at a Pro-Trump rally, wearing a hat with the MAGA inscription after his show in the SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanoye West was fried with protests in study during a broadcast on the emission - Saturnday Night Night - after a disappointing interpretation where he praised American President Donald Trump and said he would run for this post in 2020.
After interpreting his third song for that night called GEst Town, where he was holding a hat in his head, Make Americana Great - he followed up to speak with to us strong tons against the Democrats and reexploited his support for the Trump.
- Every time I talk to a white person and they say to me, \"How can you like Trump, he's a racist racist-
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,\" he said.
The SNL started the show with a parod in his role, Matt Damon, where Hollywood star came in at the Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Commission on charges of sexual harassment set up by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not transmitted, the records of West’s harsh speech were uploaded into social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to fuck West with that post or not.
Also, West complained to the spectators that he had spent a difficult time in the ass because of what he had decided on the head.
- They mistreated me in the ass.
They told me, ‘ don't get on the stage with that hat on your head.'
They mistreated me!
And then they tell me that I am drowned, he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West followed: 'Do you want to see the sun bottom, pointing out that 'cause it means that no one can tell me what to do'?
Try love.
His comments received whistles at least twice from the spectators and members of the SNL beacon seemed to be embarrassed, reports Variety, where one person told the newspaper: -The entire studio fell silently -
West had been called as a late deputy instead of Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Reperi Mac Miller, had passed away a few days ago.
West surprised a lot of people with the interpretation of the song - I Love - dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the conservative group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: - For one of the most courageous spirits: FALSEMINE PREEDERS IN THE TURME’S BALUALS END -
But the media manager, Karen Hunter, posted on Twitter that West just--was yourself and this is extraordinary--
- But I choose to make sure that MOS rewards someone (by buying music or dress or supporting garb), which I believe disgraces and spreads ideology that is harmful to my community.
And he's free.
So did We.
Before the show, the singer declared on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was already--the feeling he was formerly known as Canye West-
He is not the first artist who changed the name and follows the footsteps of Deeddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and PDdy.
His reper friend, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lyon and also the later legend of the Privacy music, changed his name into a symbol and then the artist known as the Prince.

The \"Game of Thrones\" star Kit Harington hits toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordsman in the character Jon Snow, in the violent series of medieval fantasy -Game of Thrones -
But the 31-year-old actor has hit the stereotype of the male hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young men perceive they should behave as strong to respect.
Speaking of ‘ The Sunday Times Culture', Kit said he believes that ‘ something's gone wrong' and was asked how the problem of toxic masculinity can be solved in the age of the movement #Monoo.
Kitt, who recently married his actress partner in -Game of Thrones - Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt 'important enough to resolve the issue.
'Certainly I feel this issue at the moment -- where have we been wrong with showing masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grow up, about the problems we are facing now?'
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity because of the highly masculine characters shown there.
He went on: 'What's born, and what's learned?
What is learned on TV, and what is learned on the street, that makes young people believe they should behave in a certain way to feel men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how can we change this?
Because obviously something went wrong with young people.'
During the interview, he also admitted that he would no longer shoot for -Games of Thrones - after the series ended at the end of next summer, saying that ‘ the Jews and the horses have come to the top of his nose'.
From November to November, Kitt will take part in a restoration on the scene of \"True West\" by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother a thief.
Actor recently showed that meeting with his wife Rose is the best thing she got from -Gome of Thrones -
'In this production I found my wife, so we can say that this show gave me the next family and determined my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played the Ygritte role, the sentimental interest of Kei's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic-scientific series of \"Emmy\" awards.
The couple married in June 2018 in the Leslie family property in Scotland.
HIV/Sida: China reports increases by 14% of new cases
China has announced there is a 14% increase in the number of citizens who live with HIV and Sida.
There are more than 820,000 people affected throughout the country, health authorities say.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were some 40,000 new cases reported.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, showing a change from the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spread rapidly to parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of persons receiving HIV virus through this way had almost gone zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunan.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and Sida in China has increased by 100,000.
Transmitting HIV through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexualism was de-criminalised in China in 1997, but it is said to still dominate discrimination against LGBT persons.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have measured that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Much of the transmission of the disease occurs because of inappropriate protective measures during sex in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medical drugs for HIV treatment as part of the attempt to crack down on the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that GOP senators' data have spread by staff members, saying these are ‘ dangerous lies' and ‘ conspiratorial theory'
US representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had posted personal information of the three republican senators on the pages of lawmakers in Wikipedia.
The Democrat from Los Angeles asserted that these claims were being postponed by experts and online-right extremes --
- Lies, lies, and only disgusting lies,\" Waters said in a statement at Twitter.
Information released includes house addresses and phone numbers Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah, reportedly.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing session by the Senate panel for misconduct of sexual conduct against candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The flow of information came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Some of the conservative pages like \"Gateway Pund\" and \"RedState\" reported that the IP addresses that identify the source of publications were linked to Water's office and produced the data of a Water staff member, reports Hill.
- This unfounded claim is totally unrealistically untruth and a big lie - Waters continued.
- My staff member - identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and fabricated claims - has in no way been responsible for leaking this information.
This is a total false claim and a great lie.
Waters' statement was immediately faced with online criticism, including the former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
- This denial becomes frustrating; Fleischer wrote.
- That means she doesn't have the right temperament to be a Congress member.
When someone's being accused of something they didn't do, he shouldn't get mad.
It shouldn't be a provocator.
The accuser’s motives should not be questioned.
He is to be calm and peaceable.
Fleischer appeared as though comparing Waters' response to criticism of Democrats for Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing extremely angry during Thursday's destination.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is racing to take over Waters in the elections amid the mandate, also posted his statements on Twitter.
- Big enough, if it's true, he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement Waters, Waters said her office had signalled the relevant quantities and legal-balance institutions on these false charges.
(Laughter) We will make sure the authors are uncovered; she continued, and they will take the legal responsibility for all their actions, which have devastating and dangerous effects for any of my staff
The screening of the film - Johnny English hits again - comedy with the spy equipped with Rowan Atkinson material
It has been made for any new British-inflicted film to be seen for hidden messages on Brex's theme, and this takes implementation and reinvenues on the scene of the comedy-accession-English entrepreneurship-Johny English - which has the beginnings in 2003 with - Johnny English - and the re-returning in 2011 with John English's Return
Will this satanic comedy generate just how clearly incompetent we are regarding the new national opportunities in the field of exports?
In any case, eye-eyed character going out, with face like rubber and seemingly unmanaged Johnny English, has got the authorization to confuse things for the second time--his name, which shows more than anything else that he is a broad, comical creature made for territory where no English is talking, but that keeps the cinema on.
Of course, he is a sensible, secret agent who claims to appear as fascinating, has little of the Clouseau inspector Clouse, a little of Mr. Bean's character, and a portal of the guy who contributed only to the launch of a sound in the song ‘Chariots of Fire', at the opening ceremony of the London - 2012 Olympic Games.
It is also based on the man of mysteries, traveler and international Atkinson, who once played on television advertisements that have now been forgotten to ‘ Barclaycard', leaving the place on chaos wherever he broke.
There's one or two nice moments in this movie's premiere.
I loved her when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the helica sheet crashed slightly into his helmet.
Here appears the gift of physical comedy performing Atkinson, but humor looks like hot and sometimes too much, especially when \"serious\" films like 007 and the Associated Mission have introduced a little bit of a comedial in their films.
Humor seems to address children more than adults, and the critered events of Johnny English are not as creative and are focused on voiceless movements, the same as the Atkinson performed in Bean character.
The permanent theme, as in this film, is that Great Britain is in serious danger.
A cyber hacker has been infiltrated on the super-secret network of British agents, revealing the identity of British field agents and allowing the agent in office - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a prime minister to appear as a pompous and ready to fight, who is already suffering an extraordinary political non-popularity: Emma Thompson does the best to realise the person who looks like Teres May, but there are not many texts in the scenarios that can play.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that any active spy has been compromised, so she will have to rely on someone who retired.
And that means choosing yourself, Johnny English, who was now employed as a school principal in a high-level neighborhood, but unofficially taught how to become a secret agent: there are beautiful scenes here because English is offering a spying academy in the form of rock school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former, multi-devoted Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, connected to a submarine captain, in the role of a high-level girl, where Vicki Pepperdine has been used a little bit wrong about that role.
So Batman and Robin of the total backward doing of things at the Father's Secret Service are again in action, facing the beautiful fatal feminine Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is fascinating by the attractive billionaire of technology, who claims he can solve the difficulties of British computers: the evil man Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their ridiculous and funny environment: disguised as waitressers, set a beautiful French restaurant on fire; cause chaos as they enter the luxurious Volta yacht; and English is completely confused as it tries to use virtual Reality equipment to get to know the interior parts of the Volta home.
All sequences normally are made for the final stage, but despite the fact that it's fun and noise, the whole thing looks a little bit like a children's movie.
Very moderate stuff.
Even in other movies, Johnny English, I couldn't think, did the British film industry not have a role for Rowan Atkinson that would fit his talent?
The Labourist Party denies there is a plan for Brits to work four days a week, but to be paid for for five days.
The Labourist Party led by Jeremy Corby is considering a radical plan that would make the British work four days a week - but be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company chiefs to save using an artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for employees, giving them an extra day's rest.
We would see that employees would enjoy a three - day weekend - but continuing to take home the same salary.
Sources said the idea would “produce ” with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country into the favour of employees.
The passage in a week of four days' work is an idea that has been embraced by the Trade Congress, as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A high-level source of the Labourist Party told ‘ The Sunday Times: 'Before the end of the year a policy review is expected to be announced.
'It won't happen immediately, but a week with four days of work is an aspiration compliing with the party's approach to balance the economy in favour of employees and also the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labourist Party would not be the first to embrace this idea, where and the Green Party has earlier pledged a four-day working week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not being supported by the entire Laburist Party.
A spokesman for the Laburist Party said: 'A week with four days of work is not the party policy and is not being taken into account by the party.'
Chancellor in Hije, John McDonnell, used last week's Labourist party conference to convey his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to transfer power from the ‘ anonymous managers' and the ‘ beneficiary' to public service firms.
Cancer plans in the shadow also suggest that current shareholders in water companies may not retaliate all their shares, because the secularist government can carry out ‘ construction' with reasoning of actions considered in violations.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on boards of companies and to create the Property Inclusive Fund to pass to employees 10 per cent of the private sector's capital of firms, which means a divided year-on-year in value until MAN500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy points out at 60 Minutes-- if the FBI's investigation into Cavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaug has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least a week, and raises questions whether finding the investigation bureau could influence any republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, emission correspondent 60 Minutes - Scott Pelley asked republical senators John Kennedy and Linsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
- I mean, of course, Kennedy said.
- I said that when I was going into the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called after that happened, so after the claims came out and I said, 'Did you do that?'
He was firm and clear.
However, Graham's vote seems to be carved into stone.
- I've given up my mind to Brent Cavanaugh and the difference would only make one bomb accusation,\" he said.
-Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it strongly - Graham added by referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
- And anyone she mentioned couldn't verify.
He's 36.
I don't see that something's gonna change.
What is the festival - Global Cityzen - and has he done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen festival -- an annual musical performance that contains a large and impressive list of stars that interpret and also have a very impressive mission; end poverty in the world.
Now, in his seventh year, the Global Citizen festival - will host crowds of thousands of people at the ‘ Lawn' in Central Park to not only taste the interpretations of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also be aware of the true purpose of the performance, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen festival -- which began in 2012 -- is an extension of --Global Poverty Project -- an international advocation group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
In order to benefit a free ticket to the show (except when you want to pay a VIP ticket), participants must fulfill a set of tasks, or -- as volunteer work, send an e-mail to a world leader, conducting a phone call, or any other meaningful way that would help boost awareness of their purpose to end poverty.
But how successful has the Global Cityen Festival been - when were 12 years left to achieve its purpose?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert work a real way to convince them to seek these interventions, or is it just another case of what is known to click - people who feel they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a message to Twitter?
Since 2011, - Global Cityzen - is said to have recorded more than 19 million — actions from its supporters, giving a boost to various purposes.
These actions are said to have helped promote world leaders to declare commitments and policies worth 37 billion, which reportedly will affect lives and more than 2,25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group cited 390 Gods and statements as a result of group actions, where at least $10 billion has already been distributed or provided as funds.
The group estimates that funds provided so far have produced a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include -- The Power of Nutrition -- a partnership of investors and United Kingdom applicants, committed to helping children grow with their full potential -- promising that they will give Rwanda $35m to help end their malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700/citation - by activists of Cylobalize.
- With support from the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn the social abuse of malnutrition into a reminder of the past -- the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition told the crowd -- at a direct concert in London in April 2018.
Also, the group said that after taking 5,000 actions to appeal to the United Kingdom to improve feeding for mothers and children, the government declared financing of a project -- The Power of Nutrition -- which will affect 5 million women and children who need food intervention.
In an answer to the most frequent questions on their website asked--what makes you believe we can end extreme poverty--
Global Cityzen replied: \"It will be a long and difficult road - we will sometimes fall and fail.
But like any high civil right and as movements against the apartment before us, we'll succeed, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardie B, Janelle Monáe are some of the actors who will perform this year's performance in New York, which will be presented by Deborna-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use navigators for blockades - to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
- If needed - Washington can rely on its naval navigator to prevent Russian energy from extending across markets, including the Middle East, the US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinkee has discovered, according to Washington Examiner's quotation.
Zinke claims Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it is operating at the invitation of the Syrian legitimacy government - is a pretext to explore for new energy markets.
- I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to supply it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, Europe's southern womb -- it is reportedly said.
And according to this official there are ways and ways to deal with this problem.
- The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that marine routes are open and, if necessary, to block them, to make sure that energy fails to reach the market,\" he said.
Zinkee was addressing participants in an activity held by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, an unprofitable organisation that has personified itself as the U.S. energy consumers' temper.
He proceeded by comparing Washington's access to treatment with Russia and Iran, noting that these approaches are practically the same.
-The economic pressure on Iran and Russia is much of the use and substitution of fuels,\" he said, referring to Russia as a devious one - with an economy depending on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Administrative Trump has undertaken a mission to increase the debilitated natural gas exports to Europe, thereby replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, administration officials Trump, including US President Donald Tremp, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the unsuitable project - of the gas pipeline \"Nord Stram 2's, which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a 'Croatian' of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly voiced that the $11 billion project of gas pipelines \"Nord Stream 2\" -- supposed to double the capacity of existing gas pipeline to carry to 110 billion cubic metres -- is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that the intense opposition of the project by Washington is made simply for economic reasons and is an example of unjust competition.
- I believe that we share the same opinion that energy cannot be a tool used for pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier; said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the American Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American stand has faced opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to this project.
The main organisation for the industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (DUI), has urged the US to stay away from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a lot of trouble when a third country intervenes in our energy supply, Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industries Federation (DUI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will think seriously - if he wants to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he will (thoughtly) think the part in the race for president after the elections in the middle of the mandate.
Along a town rally in Holyokee, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would take into account the running.
- It is time for women to go to Washington and to regulate our destroyed government, and this includes placing a woman to the top; she said according to The Hill.
- After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president -
Warren hit President Donald Trump during the rally in the city, saying he's taking the country in the wrong direction.
- I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,\" she said.
Warren is known for its criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a circus Friday, Warren said -- of course, before the vote we need an investigation from the FBI --
However, a poll released Thursday indicated that much of Warren’s own choices do not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' potential voters said that the senator should not run, according to the survey conducted by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Centre.
Thirty - two percent supported the candidium.
The survey showed that former Auguster Deval Patrick enjoyed greater support for running, where 38 percent supported a potential candy and 48 percent were against this run.
Other high-profile democrat names discussed to compete in 2020 include former president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, reported \"Associated Press\".
Sarah Palin cites the disorder of Trake Paul's post-traumatic stress at the Donald Trump rally
Track Paulin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being called into the military in September.
Monday evening he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence
- What my son is going through, what he is experiencing after he has returned, can connect him to other families who feel the spread of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers are doing — she told participants in a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paul called his arrest as a--elephant in the room - and said that her son and other war veterans - kind of change, hardened, come thinking if they take the proper respect of soldiers and avians and other members of the army, of what they have given the country--

18 states, D.C. support opposition to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Colombian District are backing a legal objection to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims who have escaped criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and counties deposited a explaining document as friends-of-the-art in Washington on Friday in Washington, in support of changing asylum-seeking policies, reports NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace case against Session that the American Civil Liberties Union has deposited in August against federal politics, has not been discovered.
She said her partner -- and his violent gang members -- abused her, but American officials denied her asylum request on July 20th.
She was stopped in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries producing a high number of US asylum applicants because they are countries with widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new asylum-seeking policy in the United States restored a decision, of 2014, from the Emigrants' Appeals Board allowing immigrants without documents to escape domestic violence and apply for asylum.
Colombia County General General General General Carl Razine said in a statement Friday that the new policy-indios decades of state, federal and international law-laws-
- Federal laws require that all asylum requirements should be tried according to particular facts and circumstances of the case, and such a move conflicts with this principle - stated in the report of a friend-thorn.
The lawyers further argued that the ban police made on the entry of immigrants was damaging to the American economy, voicing that their chances are to become entrepreneurs and to supply the necessary labour arm --
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer give asylum to victims who escape domestic violence and violence from gangs.
- Asian is available to those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious belief, nationality, or belonging to a certain social group or political belief, Sesession said on June 11th, on the day of the declaration of politics.
Asia has never been intended to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- with which people face every day around the world.

In the survivors, the situation was extremely honorable.
Situate feels very tense,” said 35 - year - old Mother Risa Kusuma, while carrying her young sick and sick son in an evacuation center in the destroyed town of Palu.

- I heard my wife was crying and crying for help but then quietly.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe.
The American ambassador charges China with \"exclusive declarations\"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in an American daily, where joint US-China trade benefits were propaganda, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to distribute its propaganda.
US President Donald Trup, last Wednesday, referred to the payment of ‘China Daly's' in the ‘Des Moines Register' - the paper most sold in the Iowa state - after accusing China of attempts in the US congress elections held on November 6th, an accusation denied by China.
Trump accusations that Beijing was trying to intervene in US elections marked what US officials told Reuters it was a new phase in Washington's escalated campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to impose ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a growing trade war, which has seen the equality of tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts have said China's repayment fees in this trade war were designed to crack down on exporters in countries such as Ioua, who has backed the Republican Trump Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the long-runner to Ioua, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit employees, farmers and American businesses.
In an opinion published in the ‘ Des Mies Register' Sunday's day of Sunday Brandstad wrote that, \"Kina is already doubled this harassment by putting propagandistic ads on our free press-
- By distributing its propaganda, China’s government is being assisted by the harrowing American free speech and free press by establishing a free - speech commercial on Des moines Register — Brenstad wrote.
( Contrast with this, in the kiosks of street newspapers here in Beijing, you will find very little voices against it, and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that Chinese might have of China's disturbing economic trajectory, as the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party - he wrote.
He added that -- one of the most prominent newspapers in China -- avoided the offer to publish his article -- no matter which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that republicans are changing women's voters before the elections amid the mandate following the Kavanaugh scandal
The more major characters of the republics are to solidarity and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, ahead of some claims of sexual assaults, analysts have warned that they will face an especially harsh reaction from women in the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate.
Emotions on this topic have been extremely high, and many republics have publicly declared that they want to continue voting the candidate.
These things cannot be undone - Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the University of Syracuse, ‘ School Maxwell told The Hill ’ of an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts in the last minute attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an investigation by the FBI and that it will be enough to appease angry voters.
- The women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow or November - you said on Friday, Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the ‘MoveOn' progressive group, according to the Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters sang ‘ Ninthor is coming!' while demonstrating in the corridors of the Senate as the republics in control of the Judicial Committee decided to move forward with the running of Kavanaug despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, ‘Mic's.'
- Enthusiasm and democrat motivation will reach the Maya - he told Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
- People are saying they've already been to high levels; that's true.
But it may be even higher, especially among undetermined voters women on the outskirts and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, though not liking the president, usually don't vote at all --
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing its charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's candidate, analysts suggested there would be a sharp reaction if the republicans continued to support this candidium.
-This has been converted into a procession of GOP-enforcement,\" said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to ‘ NBC News'.
-It is not only about the appointment of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaug will be deployed or not to the accused's bank, it is also about the way the republicans have addressed this issue and the way they have treated it - the NBC News, Guy Cecil, the director of Prietias USA, a group that helps to elect democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to whom to believe in the vigilance of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with this one with little higher support.
A recent survey by \"YouGov\" shows that 41 per cent of respondents certainly believe Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent say they certainly believe it or very likely Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 per cent think that Kavanaugh, probably or doubtless, has lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent say the same about Ford.
After the institution of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating claims submitted by Ford, as well as other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports: ‘ The Guardian.'
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee, under oath, that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17 while he was intoxicated.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court displayed his genital organs before her while they were at a party while they were studying in Yale, the 1980s.
World Network Creator plans to launch new internet to compete Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Network, is creating a company that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, \"Ingroup,\" is a company built by Berners-Lee platform, called \"Solid'.
‘ Solid' allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons are allowed to access a given information.
In an exclusive interview for the ‘Fast Company,' Berners-Lee said joke that the goal behind the ‘ Ingroves' is--world dominate.'
- We have to do it now, he said of this innovative company.
- It's a historical moment -
Application uses Solid technology to allow people to create --save their personal data on the network -- or a POD.
It can contain the contact lists, lists of things to do, musical lists and other personal and professional means.
It's like having access to a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spouty.
What is unique to preserving personal information on the network is the fact that it remains completely in the hands of user what information will access.
The company calls this personal power through the data-
The idea for Ingrots, according to the company's executive director, John Bruce, is to bring along resources, processes, and skills needed to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some developers contracted to work on this project, and a community of voluntary encodings.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using available tools on the website of Ingroup.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to -Facebook and Google if they should introduce a total change where all their business models are completely overthrown at night.
We do not ask their permission.
In a post in the \"Medium\" published on Saturday, Berners-Leee wrote that the Inrupt mission -- is to provide trade energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid--
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the World Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Technology Institute.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in debate of network impartiality.
Even as the Ingrot founding, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Network consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
- I'm extremely optimistic about this new network age - Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The grant of Victorian Cross celebrated during World War I for the Clergy
The only clergyman who has won a Victorian Crusade during the first world war in the quality of the warrior has been commemorated in his homeland, 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel, Honored Bernard Vann, won the medal on September 29th 1918, in the Bellenglisa and Lehaucourt attack.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and he never knew he had won the top British military title.
A memorial stone was presented by his two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Van, said that it was - unambiguously symbolic — for the memorial to appear exactly 100 years from the heroic act that gave his grandfather his medal.
According to \"Landon Gazette\", on September 29th 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann, directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin channel - through a thick fog and underdulge of bullets from fields and machine guns -
He then rushed to the line of fire and with a large source, led the battalion ahead and seized one of the weapons on the battlefield and killed three from the opposing troops.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, shortly more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions - they are something he can never achieve, but something he really displays -
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, decided from a crown after the parade, which was led by the group \"Brentwood Imperial YouTube\".
Michael Van said that he was highly honored to be part of this parade — and he added that the valor of a true hero is emerging from the support being given by many;
MMA fans stayed awake all night to attend Bellator 206, but instead they saw - Derrickicen Pepa -
Imagine, you've been awake all night to see Bellator 206, and then you've been relieved of the opportunity to see this major event.
The performance by San Jose contained 13 matches, including six pairs in the basic package and would appear in real time at night in channel 5, U.S.
At 6:00 in the morning, while Gegard Mouses and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were surprised when broadcasting changed to display Derrcice Pepa.
Some remained dissatisfied after staying awake all night till the first few hours, especially for this match.
A fan on Twitter described this transition from the match to a cartoon movie for children as -- an ugly joke--
- It is the government rules that determine that at 6: 00 a.m., the content was not appropriate, and we had to pass to a child program,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of the marketing and communications in Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
- Derrickja Pepa - yeah -
The president of the Bellator company, Scott Coker, said they would work on programmement to include and viewers from Britain in the future.
- When I think about reinsimilation, I think we can solve it,\" Coker said.
- But there is 6:00 a.m., day and Sunday and we can't solve this problem until Sunday with our watch, so Monday with their watch.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the program was introduced there were many texts that circulated, and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to play five games instead of six games, as we usually try to give more for our fans and maybe outnumber the line.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt \"inferior\" about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this motivated him to achieve success.
The 24-year-old said he hadn't realized until he went to school nine years that--not all of them were like me--
Speaking of the first program on Radio 4 of the \"Desert Island Discs,' introduced by Lauren Laverne, he said he raised his voice for homosexual rights to --presences, others.
Also, he also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less of winning an Olympic medal.
The permanent presentation of the long term programme, Kirsty Young, has taken months off because it is sick.
Pointing out as an outcast in Laverne’s first program, Dale said that while he grew up he felt uninferial — toward others because it was not socially acceptable to the boys and girls.
He said: \"Until today, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt different has been the real elements that gave me the impetus and the strength to succeed -
He wanted to prove that it was worth anything, so that he wouldn't let anyone down when they found out about his sexual orientation.
Twice the winner of the bronze Olympic medal is already a high-profile LGBT activist and used his participation in the Comonuelth Games in Australia to appeal more countries to legalise homosexuality.
He said he got out because he was lucky to be able to live openly and without consequences and that he wanted to give to others--spection--
Three times the world’s champion said that falling in love with an American moviemaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, caught me unprepared.
Last year, Daley married the Oscar award winner, who is 20 years older than he, but said that ageary difference has never been a problem.
- When he experiences so many things at such a young age - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced the same downsizing-duty.
The couple became parents in June, of a son named Robert Black-Dalley and Daley said that--this whole perspective had changed.
- If you had asked me last year, all I thought was ‘ I should win a gold medal' -' he said.
- You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie.
His son bears the same name his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with head cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he had asked was if we had the tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be on the front row.
- I couldn't say to him, ‘ You won't be on the first line dad.
He said, “I was holding my hand while he stopped breathing, and only after he stopped breathing and changed life and accepted it for the first time that he was unbreakable, and he said.
Next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
- I knew that this was what I had been dreaming about all my life - to immerse myself before the local public in the Olympic Games, there was no cooler feeling,\" he said.
It also inspired its first musical selection - Proud by Heather Small - that has accompanied it during preparations for the Olympic Games and continues to cause mornics.
Desert Island Discs is awarded at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15, with British watch.
Mickelson, out of the form, was left in the bench on Saturday in Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th match at Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his form to not turn this historic moment into disappointment.
Mickelson, for whom is the 12th time taking part in this event, a separate record this one, which is organised every two years, was left in the bench by Captain Jim Furyk, during the double games (fourballs and Fourso).
Instead of being at the centre of action, as has usually been for the United States, five times the winner of large titles spent the day supporting the team and working in hopes of leaving behind concerns.
Not among the players with the most just hit even when he was at the height of his career, 48-year-old is not a suitable player for the complicated Le Golf National field, where long, difficult fields leave no room for wrong shooting.
And if not only the fear of the field, Mickelson, on Sunday, will face the ‘ British Open,' Francesco Moliner, who has formed a team with the original Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches this week.
If the Americans, who have four less points before the start of the 12 tech games, start a momentous start, Mickelson's game could result decisively.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, even though he cannot say more.
He fully understood what he had today, gave me a blow to my shoulders, put his hand on my neck, and said he would be ready tomorrow.
- He has a lot of faith in himself.
He's at Fame's Hall and he's made a lot of contributions to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I had thought more, but it finally resulted, so we thought it was the solution.
He wants to be in the field, like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the best performer in the Ryder Cup games.
He can mark the end of his career in Ryder Cup, where he has not been at the height of his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, even though Furyk said his presence brings values to the team.
- He's a cheerful, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to bully people, and he's a fantastic boy to have him in the team room - he explained.
- Also, I think the youngest players were enjoying it during this week, and that was nice to see.
He gives more than a game.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the great leadership could disappear very soon.
Thomas Bjorn, Europe's captain, I know from experience, that the considerable chairmanship they have before the last day of their tech games in Ryder Cup, could become an unpleasant factor.
Danezi made his debut in the 1997 confrontation in Valderama, where the team with Captain Sever Baldesteros had a five-point lead against Americans closed the tournament by winning with a very narrow margin, 141-2-131-2.
He recalls to himself that we had a great lead in Valderama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderma where we won but very difficult -- said Bjorn, who was photographed after winning 5-3 in the ‘Clas 2018' Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 to ‘Left Naal'.'
So the story tells me and everybody in that team that didn't end.
Tomorrow we'll walk with the last march.
We're going there and we're gonna do the right thing.
Nothing's over until we get the score on the board.
We have a goal, try to win this trophy and here is our focus.
I've been saying it all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players on the team, but we're aware of who we have in front of - the best players in the world -
Satisfied with the productivity of his players, in a difficult golf field, Bjorn added: 'I don't want to rush to this phase.
Tomorrow we will face another “gift. ”
Tomorrow comes individual performances, and that's something else to be done.
It's fantastic when you're in the field with a partner, when things go well, but when you're alone, then you're tested in your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, tomorrow you have to give your best of yourself.
Now, forget your partner because he and he have to go and give the best of himself--
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will hope his players perform better individually than with partners, where only Jordan Spiretch and Justin Thomas took three out of four points possible.
Furyk himself has experienced both cases of major returns to the last day, being part of the Brooklyn winning team before losing in what is considered -Minah Monthicide - of the European team.
- I remember every word - when asked how he motivated his players during the last day, Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999.
- We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we must have a good start, as you did in Brooklyn and Medinah.
When you get the flow on one side, you put too much pressure on the high games.
We put the formation based on this, and we're going to bring out the boys in the rank that we believe in is best, once you know, we're trying to perform a miracle tomorrow.
Thomas has the task to start overcoming the outcome and face Rory McElroy at the leading match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Ion Rahm, Tommy Fletwood and Ian Poulter with European players positioned in the first half of the ranking.
- I chose this group and in this order I believe it covers all the paths in the game - Bjorn said of his choices.
New German Warrior Production Renominated
The new French German navy should have been sent in 2014 to replace the cold wartime fighting, but will not be ready until at least next year because of problematic systems and very high costs, local media reported.
The ship of new frequencies, ‘ Banden-Wuerttemberg-class,' has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper “Die Zeit's quoting a military spokesman.
The ship had to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after sending it damaged the fate of the ambitious project.
The four boats of the \"Baden-Wuertemberg-cllass\" type that were ordered by the navy in 2007 will serve as substitute for the old \"Bremen-clas\" frequencies.
Known will contain a powerful ball, a series of anti-air missiles and anti-animation and anti-animation technology (stealth) -- such as reduction of radar detection, red infrars and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to move new frequencies for more than two years away from the country's ports.
However, constant delays mean that the latest technology warships -- said to enable Germany to reflect power abroad -- will be obsolete at the time they enter the ministry, writes ‘ Die Zeit.'
The ‘ unfortunate' F125 fratta came out on the front pages last year, when the German navy officially rejected its message to this ship and sent it back to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that Marina would return a ship to her builder after surrender.
They gave them some information about the reasons of returning, but the media in Germany quoted a series of major effects on software and hardware — making the ship useless during a war mission.
Problems at the programme were especially important on the Beden-Wuertemberg-clas ships because they will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - half the workforce of the old frequencies of ‘Bremen clas'.
It was also found that the ship was overweight, which reduced its productivity and restricted the Navy’s ability to increase improvements in the future.
-Rheinland-Pphaltz - of 7,000 tons, is believed to be twice the weight of similar categories used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to difficult physical parts, the price of all project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it has reached a figure of 3.1 billion unannounced 3.1 billion ($.6 billion) from the first predicted 2.2 billion.
Problems that have stuck the new frequencies become especially important after recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the defense committee in the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is being completed the appropriate ships to move to another country --
The official said that the problem had been added over time because the old ships had been extracted from use but were not replaced by new ones.
He regretted that none of the new Beden-Wuertemberg-class frigates would be able to join the Navy.
National trusts watch secret night bats' lives
A new research being developed by a company in the mountainous regions of Scotland aims to find out how bats use the field to hunt for food.
It is hoped that new findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help safeguard activities in the future.
The research by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual night bats and those called soprano pipistrelles, as well as ear-sided caf and Daubenton bats in Inverewe gardens, in Wester Ross.
Specific registration equipment will be placed in key points across the area to track the activities of bats across the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct studies on the ground using hand detectors.
The analysis of the sound that will be performed by experts for all records will determine the frequency of the sound of the bat and what every species does.
Then a report will be drafted, and a map of their habitat to provide a detailed panorama of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural protection adviser to the NTS, hopes the findings will show which habitats are more important to bats and how they are used by every species.
This information would help determine the goods of the settlements, such as the creation of pastures and maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the entire United Kingdom has dropped dramatically over the past century.
They are under the threat of construction and development works that affect nests and habitat loss.
Crowds of wind and enlightenment can also pose dangers, as shown by sticky letters or chemical components of building materials, as well as domestic animal attacks.
The bats are not really blind.
However, because of their habits of hunting at night, their ears are more beneficial than their eyes when it comes to catching and waiting.
They use a sophisticated technology to locate location through sounds to accurately determine insects and barriers during flight.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is very serious with bats.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, nest inspections, and sometimes engage in rescue programs.
The organisation even set up the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to bats in Threas, Dumphreys, and Galloway, which serves as a house for eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The manager of this reserve, David Thompson, says that this country is the ideal territory for them.
He said, \"Here we have an excellent area for bats.
- We have old buildings, many ancient trees, and all the right habitats.
But there are still a lot about the bats that remain unknown, so the work we do here and in other countries will help us to understand what they need to be \"developed\"--
It stresses the importance of the feminine controls before performing property maintenance work because there is a possibility that the uninhibited destruction of a nest can kill as many as 400 female bats and young people, thus eliminating the whole population of one area.
The night's bats are protected, and killing, harassing and disturbing them, or destroying their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official to the Trust for Safety of Night Laurents, encourages people to become a part of the aid.
She said, \"We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species, we just don't know how their population is shifting -
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said that charges of rape against him are misguided - saying that people - want to promote themselves - using his name.
His lawyers are committed to suing the German news magazine \"Der Spiegel,\" which published these charges.
Portugal and Juventus' attacker has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he later claimed he paid her $375,000 so he wouldn't talk about the incident.
Speaking on a video literary video in Instagram, heading to 142 million of his followers, just a few hours after the publication of these claims, Ronaldo, 33, considered the reports to be fake - news -
- No, no, no, no, no.
What was said to them today, the false news - said five times the winner of the Golden Top.
- They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but this is part of the job.
I'm a happy person and everything's going well; the player added by smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue \"Der Spiegel\" on such charges, which they have called \"unacceptable reports of allegations about private life\".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for moral values in the value corresponding to the seriousness of violations, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years --
The alleged incident has reportedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Cazino in Las Vegas.
According to documents presented at the Clark Circle Court in Nevada, after meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorna reportedly went to the player's room, where they claimed he was raped in anus.
Mayora claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident, and said that (39 per cent) it is a good son - left in the mud by - a percentage -
The document says that Ronald confirms that the couple had sexual relations but that he was with the acceptance of both sides.
Mayorna also claims she went to the police and that she had photos of her injuries to a hospital, but later agreed to a solution outside the court because she was responsible for retaliation -- and that she was concerned that she would be publicly-trained --
34-year-old says he is now trying to return the deal because it continues to be traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer it passed to the Italian giants of Juventu in an agreement of 100m euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom “will forever repent\" of losing the status of car producers
The United Kingdom - will forever repent - if the world leader's status is to lose in the production of cars after Brex, Secretary for Business Greg Clark said about business.
He added that it was disturbing — that Toyota in the United Kingdom had said about the BBC that if Britain was to leave the EU without an agreement, society would temporarily ban production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
- We need a deal, Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border, in the case of outright exit, would cost job loss.
The plant in Burnaston - which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 1500,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
- In my judgment, if Britain emerges from the EU at the end of March, we will stop production in our factory -- said Marvin Cooke, the administrative director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car producers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have also voiced fears of leaving the EU without agreement and of how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said that after Brex, it will close its Mini series factory for a month.
Key concerns relate to what car manufacturers refer to as risks of supply chains in the case of an agreementless Brex.
Toyota's production line works on base - immediately as soon as it is ordered - with sections coming every 37 minutes from the suppliers from the UK and the EU, for ordered vehicles.
If, on March 29th, the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, there may be delays at the border, which according to this industry could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold on to its plant in Derbyshire the inventory of more than one day, the company said, and therefore the product would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said The Hague May's \"Chequers\" plan for future relations with the EU has been specifically built to avoid these controls at the border --
We need a deal, and we want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment as well as to use this opportunity -- he said to the Today's BBC Radio 4.
- The data, not just from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we should certainly be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain -
Toyota could not determine how long the plant's competitiveness would stop production, but in long-term terms, it warned that increased costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and therefore lead to job reductions.
Peter Tsouvallar, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and who is a senior official of the Union union in the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: \"According to my experience at the time these jobs are closed, they are no longer coming back.
A government spokesman said -- we have set a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU --
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, the White House says
Donald Trump's summit with Deputy Prosecutor General Rossenstein can also be held for a week - after fighting for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh said Sunday the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interventions in the election, links between Trump and Russia's aid personnel and the possibility that the president has hampered justice.
The discussion if Trump will either dismiss or not the deputy prosecutor general from the task, thus jeopardising Mueller's independence, is something that created rumors for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein considered imposing a listener to record the talks with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president through the amendment of 25.
Rosenstein denied this news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, among reports that he was close to resigning.
Unlike expected, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would prefer — not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a match with the hearing session held by the Senate Judicial Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of unpredictable sexual conduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI weekly investigation for claims against Kavanaug, further pushing the full vote to the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present today at Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, \"No date has been set yet, it may be this week.
But let's see, and I always like to keep the press up.
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held press conferences at the White House since 10 September.
Moder Chris Wallace raised the question why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences did not result from dissatisfaction with the attitude of television journalists -- even though she said: 'I will not deny that they attract attention-
It then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press will grow.
She said, adding, not quoting data, that's what we've seen.
There will continue to be a press conference, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask directly to the president of the United States, then this is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this often and you've seen that we've done it often over the last few weeks, replacing press conferences in cases when you can talk to the president of the United States-
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or at the press conference with important personalities.
The individual press conferences are rare.
The president probably showed the reason for this fact, during this week, in New York, where he made a controlling exit and in some strange cases, ahead of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to employees from the EU, in NHS Scottland, about fear of Brex
Health Secretary has written to staff from the EU that works in NHS in Scotland to express gratitude in the country's name and the desire to remain even after Brex.
Jeanne Freeman, MP of the Scottish parliament, has sent a letter when there are even less than six months left from the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken the costs of application for permanent residence status for EU citizens working in public services at the local level.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: \"The summers have continued negotiations on leaving the UK to the EU, drawing a decision in the fall.
But the UK government has also intensified its preparations in the case of an agreement-free scenario.
I know this is a pretty troubling time for you all.
For this reason, I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, despite their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that increase and improve health care work, increasing the benefits of patients and communities to which we serve.
Scotland is surely your home, and we wish that you stay here.--

Tennessee Stete Tigers Christation Abercrombia's centre undergoed an immediate surgical intervention following the head injuries suffered on Saturday, in the loss of 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodore, columnist The Tennessean, Mike Organ, reported.
Tennessee coach Ethan Rod Reed told reporters that damage occurred just before the first part.
He came to the sideline and fell down there, Reed said.
The trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the sideline before putting him on the stretcher and sending him for further examinations.
An official of Tennessee State told the WSMV Chris in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vanderbilt Hospital Hospital Hospital Centre.
Harris added that--there is still no details about the type of injury-- and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.

Buyers with foreign nationality will pay higher poultry taxes when they purchase a property in the UK
Buyers with foreign nationalities will pay higher poultry taxes for purchasing a property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless under new Conservative Party (Tory) plans.
This move will neutralise the success of Corbyn initiative to attract new voters
The stamp table will apply on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The treasury department envisions collecting up to 120m GBP per year to help homeless
The May will announce today that foreign national buyers will pay the highest poultry tax for purchasing a property in the UK, and the additional money will be used to help the homeless.
This movement will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corby's initiative to attract new voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and -- target the highly profitable person.
The stamp tax will apply to individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, while additional money will support the government's initiative to fight a lack of housing.
This extra tariff -- which adds to the current poultry tax, including increasing the tax scale introduced two years ago for second homes and for property purchased to leased -- could amount to three per cent.
The Treasury Department predicts that this movement will collect up to 120m GBP annually.
About 13 per cent of the properties recently built in London are purchased by repositors outside the UK, which causes the rise in prices and makes housing more difficult for the first time.
Many rich areas of the country -- especially in the capital -- have become ghost towns — because of the high number of foreign national buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson called for reducing the stamp tax to help young people buy their first house.
He accused large construction firms that they are maintaining high prices by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to give up quotas for affordable homes in order to regulate Britain’s home-turp with property -
Mr. Corbyn has proposed some attractive housing reforms, including rent control and removal of all -- no reason-
Also, he wants to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Ms. May said: - Last year I declared that I would dedicate the mandate of the prime minister to the return of the British dream - that is, for a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing the problematic home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life here.
It is not fair, however, that individuals who do not live in the UK and foreign societies have more simply to buy homes than the British workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a house has become something very difficult to achieve, and injustice to the homeless is more than real.
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to train Scotland'
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his biggest ambition - is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
Scotland, 42, is enjoying the challenge of re-engineing the north-east club, which is currently positioned at third place in the League One (3th place), three points from the head.
He came to Drita Stadium this summer after returning St Mirren to Premier League Scocese last season.
- I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I showed up at representative B and that's all -- said Ross for the BBC Scott Sportsund.
- But as a child, I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father, and it is something that has always drawn me.
However, this option will only come if I'm successful in running clubs --
Ross in Sufferland's ancestors included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allarcy, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic says he is not worried that he is following the steps of these big names in such a large club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswick Town.
- For now, my success will depend on whether I can turn this team into Premier League?'
Given the structure and environments of this club, he certainly belongs to Premier Liga,\" he said.
- It's not a simple job to go there, but I'd see myself successful only if I could bring the club back to Premier Liga.
Ross has only started his career as a coach after a period of assistant courier in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in Hearts leadership staff.
He then helped Alloa climb up a category higher and up to the third round of the cup, and transformed St Mirren from a club near the fall from the category to winners of the title of the Championshipp next season.
And now, Ross says he feels better than ever felt during his career as a player of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
- Maybe it was a turning point,\" he says, for taking Alloa's direction.
- I really believed that training was the right thing for me, more than being a player.
It seems strange because I played well, I lived a good life because of this profession, and I enjoyed some good accomplishments.
But being a player can be difficult.
You have to experience a lot of things every week.
Again, I experience a lot of work pressure and pressure, but training seems to be the right job.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing something like this.
Full interview can be heard on Sunday, in Sportsroom, September 30th, Radio Scottland from 12:00 to 13:00 BST
According to one study, the perfect time--to drink a beer--is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased local revenues in a difficult situation in Britain, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that sales in local and bar groups increased by 2.7 per cent in July - but shops in restaurants dropped by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant in the CGA, who compiled the data, said: \"The continuous sunny weather, as well as the participation of England at the World Cup longer than expected to influence July to follow the same trend as June, where local sales increased by 2,8 per cent, while restaurants recorded even higher decline.
Rising at restaurants fell by 1.8% in June, and worsened further in July.
Bars and premises with main cargo delivery registered better performance, higher growth than the reduction of trade in restaurants.
The main-building cafes also recognized decline as a result of sunny weather, though not as considerable as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
The sales of bars and local drinks increased by 6.6 percent that month, while food fell by three percent -
Paul Newman, a free-time analyst and hospitality analyst in RSM, said: -- these results confirm the tendency we have seen since late April.
When it comes to sales on the inspective market, the weather and the impact of key social events or sports remain the main factors.
No wonder restaurant groups continue to face difficulties, although a decline in sales by 4.8 percent per year will have a particularly heavy burden, considering constant pressure on costs.
Longer summer and heat could not come at a more difficult moment for food operators, and time will show whether the average temperatures in August will give much - wish calm -
The total increase in local and restaurant sales, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the brand launch.
The Coffer Peach Industry Resurrection Index, for the MB bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses data from 47 societies, totaling more than 9 billion GBPs, and is the reference point of the industry.
One out of five children has secret accounts in social media that they hide from parents
According to one study, one in five children - a few of whom no more than 11 years of age have secret accounts in social media hiding from parents and teachers.
A poll by 200,000 nine-year-old education students displayed the increases of false Insta profiles -
This news has increased fear of sexual restraints
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a primary account - related to their parents
One in five children - some of whom is not more than 11 years old are taking account in social media, which are using adults secretly.
A survey of 200,000 nine - year - old education students revealed the rapid increase of false profiles Insta - related to the photo distribution site, Instagram.
This news has increased fear of sexual restraint.
Twenty percent of the students said they use a pure, clean account to their parents, but they also have a private account.

Eilee Doyle will be the shoot of athletes - aboard the Atletics in Scotland
Elydius Doyle has been chosen on the aboard of the Atletics in Scotland, in the post of the non-executive director of this directorship, during the annual meeting of the general assembly.
Doyle is the most decorous Scottish athlete of the decorations and fields, and President Ian Beattie described this decision as a great opportunity for all sports directors to benefit from its extensive international experience over the past decade.
- Eileh enjoys massive respect in the athletic community in Scotland, UK, and the world, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from making that part of the board -- Beattie said.
Doyle said: \"I am excited that I will serve as the voice of athletes, and I hope very much that I will contribute and help run sports in Scotland-

Breast pump advertising comparing mothers to cows shares public opinion
A breast pump production society has shared public opinion with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
To begin promoting what is considered - the first breast pump in the world quietly and that can be worn - the association of consumer technology products, Elvie, displayed a joyous music video to promote the freedom that this new pump gives to mothers who need to express themselves freely.
Four real mothers dance in a pile of cows loaded under the sound of a text with the following: \"Yes, I milk myself, but my tail has no-- and if you hadn't noticed, these aren't my type.
Refrene continues: \"Popopo, pumping, feeding Bebuses, pumping, pomping ladies--
However, the ads, which were published on the band Facebook page, have caused online debates.
With 77,000 glances and hundreds of comments, videos have received friendly reactions from viewers, many claiming to be underestimated - received in the milk industry.
- The use of cows to advertise this product is a very weak decision.
It is the same as us, and they are to be left unborn, so that they may produce milk, and that their bridal talk will be taken from them a few days after the birth of a child.
Elvie Bay pump is placed inside the recipes and does not notice (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Sworryly traumatic for mother and child.
Why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?
Someone else added: 'What a staunch advertising '
Others supported the ad, among whom one woman admitted that the song seemed to be grieving.
- I think this is a genius idea.
I would have bought one if you still fed the baby with the baby.
Pomping made me feel just like a cow.
The statement's a little crazy, but I saw what it means.
This is a genius product; someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a cheerful advertising to mothers who use their pump (specially at work or in toilets) and who feel like numblands.
This is not an advertisement that assessss or judges the milk industry -
At the end of the video, the women’s group indicate that they have all danced with the small, resilient pump.
The concept behind this campaign is based on data that many females who use breast pumps say that they feel cows.
However, Elvie's pump is silent, no fibers or tubes, is placed inside the recipes, and is not noticed, giving women freedom to move, keep their babies, and even come out while they use it.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD (Expective Critic Crete) in Mother commented: -Pampa Elvis is such a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative promotion.
Making a parallelism between women who want to be freely expressed and milk cows, we wanted to note the use of the breast pump and challenges they face, also showing in a way of entertainment and similar the tremendous sense of freedom that gives the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump comes out on the front page.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared in Marta Jakubowski style palar using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have moved silently to a tent camp at the Texas border
The number of banned immigrant children has increased, even though the monthly amount of crossings at the border has remained relatively the same, partly the result of strict rhetoric and policies presented by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to send children to their supporters.
Usually, most supporters have been themselves unmarked immigrants, fearing to risk their stay instead of trying to apply for a child.
The risk grew in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults of the same family would have to give fingerprints, and these data would pass to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Emigration and Customs Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens who had applied to support unique minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have earlier criminal precedents.
- A total of 80 percent of supporters or supporters family stay illegally in place, and a large part of them are foreigners with criminal precedents.
So, we're continuing to follow these individuals,\" said Mr. Albence.
According to housing officials, trying to process child records sooner, officials presented new regulations asking some of them to appear in court within a month of the ban, not after 60 days, as was the previous standard.
Many of them will be presented before the immigration judges through video conferences and not physically, to argue their request for legal status.
Those who are unqualified will be deported immediately.
According to housing employees and reports taken from the system in recent months, the longer the children remain banned, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which could lead to violent explosions or attempts to escape.
Supporters say these concerns are more serious in the larger environments such as Tornilo, where, because of its size, there are more likely to be overlooked by signs showing that a child has difficulty.
They add that moving children to the tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could cause trauma that many of them already face.
Syria urges American, French and Turkish \"invasive forces\" to withdraw immediately
During his speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouale also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has already entered the eighth year.
Mouale, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, declared that foreign forces remain in Syrian lands illegally, with the pretext to fight terrorism, and that they will act with them in the right way --
- They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally - he declared during the assembly.
Mouale insisted that the fight against terror has nearly ended -- in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been deported from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue -- fight in this sacred battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories -- both from terrorist groups and foreign illegal forces --
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of this country divided by war.
For the refugee case, Moalle said that conditions are good for them to return, and blame them - some Western countries - that they spread irrational fears - which moves refugees to stay away.
-We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return - he said.
- They politicize a matter that must be fully humanitarian -
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide assistance to rebuild Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral area in the recent rebel fortress in Idlib has created opportunities to move forward with political discussions.
The Russia-Turkey deal avoided a broad-scale attack by Russia-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moule noted that the agreement had clear guidance - and expressed confidence that military attacks will target jihadists, including warriors from Front Nusra associated with Al-Qaeda, who will be destroyed -
UN envoy Staffan de Mistur hopes soon to call the first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mouale presented the conditions for government participation on this committee, saying the work of the panel should be limited - to revise the provisions of the current constitution - and warned that there are no interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in 2020 except when, as many people with liberal views hope, accusations and scandals put an end to his presidency prematurely.
In what would surely be the most dramatic end of a predestination in history -
So far, there are no signs of the fatigue of the viewers.
Since 2014, the number of viewers during the peak hours has doubled to 1,05 million in CNN and has almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average viewer of 2.4 million during the peak class, up from 1.7 million that was four years ago, while the MSNBC programme -- The Rachel Maddow Shaw -- has reached the top of the cable canal ratings of 3.5 million viewers during the evenings of major events.
- This is a fire that people withdraw because it's something we don't understand -- said Neal Baer, head of the dramatic series in ABC -Designated Survivor - which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedie writer and author of -- Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Trusts About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys - Club - has another theory.
It brings to memory a taxi trip to Boston ahead of the 2016 elections.
The driver had told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why did she ask her.
He answered, \"Because it makes me laugh,\" Mrs. Scovell told me.
There are amusing value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything on television, stories from Washington can determine the future of Roe V. Wade, if migrant families can join and the health of the global economy.
Disregarding is a luxury that only the most privileged audiences can afford.
Yet, if you find yourself after six hours of viewing a panel of experts who debate the use of uncivil information - by Bob Woodward in his book -Fear - the bench shell of Paul Manapers' stric skin, worth 150,000 USD (a full garment) as well as the implications for life descriptions of Stomor Daniels, for the an anam of zonto, then this dog goes beyond.
I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
- Part of what he does and makes it look like a \"reality show,\" it's that he feeds you with something every night,\" said Brent Montgomery, executive chief of the Whelhouse Entertainment and creator of -Pawn Stars - in terms of circulating actors and unexpected daily developments of the Tremp programme (debat with N.F.L.L., praises for Chemun Jong).
You can't leave an episode without seeing otherwise stand back.
When I went to Mr. Fleis this week, time was sunny and temperature outside was 80 degrees, outside his home on the northern coast of Kawai, but he was hiding inside, watching MSNBC, while registering CNN.
He could not leave, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on the edge of the Persian.
- I remember when we accomplished all those crazy programs in the past and the people who said, - this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization - Mr. Fleiss told me.
- I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Money from outside the private sector flows into tight competition for Congress elections
It is not surprising that the 17th area of Pennsylvania is facing a flood of money, as a result of the reorganisation of electoral areas obliging two office officials to compete for the same post.
This recent reorganisation of the outskirts of Pittsburgh has established Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won the post in another area in special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republic Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th region of Pennsylvania, which has been deployed on the new 17.
This new draft division came after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's ruling, which, in January, said the old areas were unconstitutionally and unfairly appointed in favour of the Republicans.
This race, in the new 17 zone, has also spurred a strong confrontation in financing campaigns from main party funding organs, the Democratic Committee for Congress Fields (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow-profit victory in the general elections, followed by March 18th of Pennsylvania's electoral zone.
For more than a decade, that post was held by Republicans, and President Donald Trump won this area by 20 points of difference.
Political experts see Democrats as light favourable.
US considers penalising El Salvador for support to China, then withdraws
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little impetus from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Carlos Warela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organisation's management team.
State Department officials decided to remove American diplomatic mission chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the recent settlements to no longer recognise Taiwan - said department spokeswoman Heather Nauert during a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were investigated only to El Salvador, who received an aid of about 140 million USD from America in 2017, including narcotics control, development and support of the economy.
The proposed crimes, which included reductions of financial assistance and certain restrictions in visa release, would be serious for the Central American country and its high levels of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings reached progress, officials of North and Central American countries postponed a high-level conference with security focus and economic well-being to attend a similar meeting last year, a move seen as stepping forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to develop, ending any opportunity to establish penalties against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has planned to give a talk at the conference, which is predicted in mid-October, a signal showing the importance the administration costs this meeting, diplomats expressed.
And all three US envoys returned calmly from El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic, without strong messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House official for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate outlined by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to talk about internal discussions, provided their anonymity was preserved.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst close to the administration, who also spoke, seeking anonymity right.
Study History
The next event expected to occur could be Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller's report of possible obstruction by Mr. Trup, for whom there is considerable evidence in public data.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly relocating his investigation to establish whether during his campaign, Mr. Trump has co-operated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its side, Mr. Trump will have to account before this body, at a time when preparing to come out again before voters, and may eventually face an independent jury.
These are very much if, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall - or that of his counterparts in Europe, is inevitable.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic, have to make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to coup against Hitler if the West had resisted and backed Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on these turning points, which accelerate or delay the unstoppable roading of democracy.
Actually, Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump unloads Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the investigation into Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has not been in a difficult situation since this newspaper reported last year, that he had suggested secretly listening to the president, as well as speculating that he is not appropriate to stay on duty.
Mr. Rosenstein said that The Times article is not accurate.
- How will we respond if the new investigative investigation requested by the F.B.I. for Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or whether he is confirmed at the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the upcoming elections for a Congress that will consider Mr. Trump responsible?
If we fail in these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime that captured the residence of ambassadors I lived in.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table that bears the symbol of the savastic (broken crossroads).
Having this legacy, how may I not be optimistic about our future...

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic before facing Rapid Wienna
On Thursday, Rangers wait Rapid Wienna, knowing that a victory in front of the Austrians, following the stunning equality in Spain in front of Villarreal, earlier this month, would put them in a favourable position to qualify in the group G, of Europe's League.
A knee injury did not allow the Graham Dorrans midfield to make the first appearance of this season in 2-2 to Villarreal equality, but he believes Ranges can use it as a impetus to achieve bigger things.
-It was an important point for us because Villarreal is a good team,\" said 31-year-old.
- We entered the field believing we could get something and came out with a point.
We could have marked the end, but I generally believe that equality was a righteous result.
Maybe they were better in the first part while we showed up in the second part and we were the best team.
On Thursday, it will be another major European evening.
I hope we can get three points but it's going to be a tough game because they got a positive result in their last match, but, with fans supporting us, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, due to damaged injuries and changes in the club, but now there is a factor of optimism in this team.
The team is fine, and the boys are enjoying this very much; the training is fine.
Perhaps we will be able to move ahead and throw down the last season behind us and succeed.
Women sleep less as a result of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of how we wanted family members to be careful about them, very few talked to them about this.
About half of the individuals in the study of NationalWise said that they spoke to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent responded that they spoke to their children about it.
-People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it - said Holly Snyder, vice president of society for providing life, Nationwide.
Here's where we gotta start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not first show your desires.
Work with your counselor and family, and discuss where and how to take care, as these choices can be an important factor in setting costs.
Take your financial adviser as well: The Advisor can help you find a way to pay expenses.
Options for long-term financing include a traditional security policy for long term care, hybrid police for providing life with savings to help cover these expenses or self-security through your wealth - as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through a authorization.
Take a health care procurer and appoint a trusted person who will supervise your health care and guarantee that experts act in accordance with your desires if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the procurement of your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions in your name and guarantee the payment of bills if you cannot do anything like that.
Remember little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about allergies and the medications you receive?
Prepare a written plan so that you can be ready.
- It is not only the financial aspect at stake but also who the doctors are. - asked Martin.
- What medications will be used?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan.

Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesian city Paulu on Friday, officials have declared the number of dead people are expected to rise.
With networks of communication outside the office, employees of the assistance have failed to receive information from the Donggala Regen, an area in the north of Palu, which was closer to the level of the earthquake size of 7.5.
In Paul, over 16,000 people have been evacuated after this disaster.
Below you have facts about Paul and Donggala on the island of Sulawes:
Paul is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with populations of some 379 800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a registry that stretches over 300 miles (180 km) along the coastline northwest of the island of Sulawes.
The agency, a less administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of some 299 200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and shopping are the province's main economic activities, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The extraction of the nicel is also important in the province, but it is mainly focused on Morowal, on the other side of the Sulwesi coast.
According to the Agency for Disasters in Indonesia, Paul and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunami over the past 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami took over 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami struck the western part of Donggala, causing nine victims.
Indonesia is in the seismic area of the Pacific Ocean of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Below, find some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26th, a powerful earthquake on the western coast of Aceh in Indonesia, in the northern part of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 states, causing 226,000 victims along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half lived in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds lost their lives on the island of Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-strong earthquake struck the summer south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that crashed on the southern coast and claimed about 700 lives.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake in the vicinity of the town of Padang, capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 1100 people were left dead.
2010: A 7.5-strong earthquake struck one of the Mentawa islands in Sumatra, causing a 12-foot tall tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pydie Jaya Regenture in Aceh, bringing destruction and panic upon humans after remembering the destruction caused by the quake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people lost their lives in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit Lombok's tourist island, taking more than 500 people, most of whom in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Paul’s oldest son has been arrested with family violence charges
Track Paulin, the eldest son of Alaska's former general and vice-president for president, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
According to a report filed on Saturday by the state police of Alaska, Paulin, 29, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect in domestic violence, for obstructing reporting violence in the family, and for opposition to arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman, his acquaintance, tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone.
Paul is being held at the Mat-Su detention building and is being held a guarantee in the form of unsure bonds worth $500, KTU reported.
According to reports of this network, he was presented in court on Saturday, and when asked about admitting guilt, he said - he is absolutely innocent -
Paulin faces three violations of the A category, which means he can be imprisoned up to a year and fined $2500,000.
He is also charged with a violation of the B category, which is sentenced to one day in prison and 2000 fines.
It's not the first time criminal charges arise against Paul.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Paul.
His mother, Sarah Paul, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently being examined by the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, the prevention of reporting domestic violence and drunken weapons during the incident.
His girlfriend had pretended he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Paul was criticised by veterans' groups after connecting her son's violent behavior with PTSD (Pat-traumatic stress syndrome) as a result of serving Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia — Hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people have lost their lives on Friday, as a result of an earthquake that has hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-strong earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are out of service, and the death toll is expected to rise during the following days.
The earthquake hit the central part of Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Djakarta.
Social media circulates videos showing the moment of the hit.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu when the tsunami struck the shore.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for the alleged terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York but seek the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare sentence that has not been handed down for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, is supposed to have used a Home Depot rented truck to conduct the terrorist attack on a bike route along the Western highway, in the lower Manhattan, violating infants and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov has killed eight victims, and that it has caused severe body injuries - premeditation - by letter to seek death penalty, presiding in the southern New York district.
According to a court document, for both of these charges a death sentence could be inflicted.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury put Saipov in front of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of organised crime, accusations often used by prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motoristic means.
This attack has resulted — significant and premeditated planning — the prosecutors say, describing the way the crime was executed by Saipov as - abominable, cruel, and moral -
-Saifullo Habich Saipov caused damages, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariellej, Hernan Feruchi, Hernan Diegosis, and Alejan Dagnomia Pagnucco - it is written in the letter of purpose.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since New York's southern district prosecuted a death sentence case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York, it was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of having carried out conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union for the benefit of two years before the Cold War.
Both were executed in electric chairs on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, of Uzbekistan nationality, did not demonstrate penance during days and months after the attack.
He has declared before the investigators that he feels good about what he has done, police reported.
According to the actress, Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone.
Police said he had also sought to deploy the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He has declared he is innocent of 22 lawsuits.
David Patton, one of the public lawyers representing Saipov, said they are -- very disappointed with the prosecution's decision.
- We feel that the decision to seek the penalty of death rather than the admission of guilt accompanied by life imprisonment without an appeal will increase the trauma caused by all concerned -- Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek death sentence.
Conservative Party MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be deployed at the helm of Brex negotiations
Niguel Farage promised today, during a protest at the Conservative conference, that he would 'mobilize the army of the people'.
The former leader of the UKIP said politicians should 'press pressure' and Eurosceptics' -- as one of Theresa May suggested he should be at the helm of negotiations with the EU.
In March, Conservatory MP Peter Bone said at Birmingham that the MB's would be out if Brex's secretary was Mr. Farage.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May to join its group has been noted by the pro-constitutive conservatives in the EU, who joined another protest in the city against Brex.
The prime minister is facing difficulties in implementing the compromise plan reached at Chequerors, amid attacks stemming from those wanting stance or removal from the European Union, as well as from the EU itself.
The Allies insist it will attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels despite tough reactions - and will force Eurosceptics and labers to choose between its package and chaos.
During the long-distance march, Mr. Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequeror Agreement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be headed and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were at the top, we would be out now,' he said.
The deputy of Wellingborough added: 'I will support Brex, but we must abandon the Chequeror Agreement.'
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to draft our laws in our country.'
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.'
Conservatory Andrea, who supports Brex, was also on march and told reporters: 'I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequer agreement is not supported by the wide public, the opposition will not vote, supports either inside our party, and by activists filling the roads and voting us.
Please leave Chequers and start listening.'
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: 'The ministers keep the job in cases of holding promises.'
Mr. Farage said during the march that politicians must 'press pressure' if they are thinking about abandoning the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'Now, this is a matter related to trust between us--the people--and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brex and we're here today to tell him that 'we won't let you do anything like that'.'
During a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to force our political class, which is close to abandoning Brex, to feel pressure.
'We are mobilising the army of the people of this country that gave us victory in Brex, and we will not stop until the United Kingdom is independent, proud and government itself.'
Meanwhile, they promoted their tenure to Birmingham before carrying a gathering that lasted two hours in the center of the city.
A small group of activists held banners written against Brex, following the weekend performance of this group.
Laborists support Lord Adonis ironed the conservatives about the security problems they had with a social disabilities - at the beginning of the conference.
\"These are the people who tell us they can prepare the TI systems and the technology needed for @annada plus - for open borders, for free trade with Ireland,\" he added.
It's totally a farce.
There is no such thing as good Brex,' he said.

One of the participants asked him if he plans to run for president.
Warren replied that the time has come for the women to go to Washington and settle the broken government, and that includes placing a woman to the top --

Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after team instructions give victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Walter Bottas qualified before Lewis Hammilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team guidelines would play a significant role in this race.
Bottas left the first place, and almost managed to subtract the Hamilton after defending his position on the first two walks and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to take a stop and left Hamilton to race in turphic — at the end of the car collection, something that should have resulted in crucial results.
Mercedes made the stop a walk later and positioned behind Vettel, but Hamilton came out after several manoeuvres that forced Ferrari pilot to leave space inside after a double movement to protect in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race from the last row and at the end of the first run was seventh on his 21st birthday.
He was then headed in a large part of the race after failing to change his tires to reach a quick finish and passed Kimimy Raikconen, ranking fourth.
Eventually, he made a stop on the 44th drive but failed to improve the pace in the remaining eight walks, leaving Raikconen's fourth place.
It's a tough day because Walter did a great job all weekend and proved to be a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these exchanges of positions,\" Hamilton said.
We use too weak body language
President Donald Trump ironised the Dianne Feinstein Senate during a rally Saturday in connection with its insistence, that it was not the person who monarched in the square -- the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brent Cavanaugh, of sexual assault.
During a speech at a gathering in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony given by Ford before the State Committee of Senate, but said that what was happening in Senate indicates that people are -- evil, bad, and unscrupulous --
- The only thing that can happen and the beauty of what is happening in Senate over the last days is when you look at anger, when you see people being angry, wicked, bad, and unsatisfactory,\" he said.
- When you look at the publication and then I brought out the people who say, \"oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, was it you who put the letter in the square?
You remember her answer... did you post the document - oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't bring it out.
Wait a minute.
He said: \"Nay, we have not brought him out, but we have not brought him out.
In July, Feinstein was sent letters with details of charges against Kavanaugh from Ford, and the document emerged earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that information had come out of her office.
- I didn't hide the charges of Dr. Ford, I didn't bring up her story in the square-- she told the commission, The Hill reported.
- She asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it like she asked me to--
But apparently her denial was not acceptable to the president, who commented during Saturday evening's debate: - In my opinion, the gestures really left to desire.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen any weaker gestures before.
Taking the candidate for the Supreme Court for protection, which has been charged by three women with indecent sexual conduct, the president said the Democrats are using supposed charges to achieve their intentions.
- They are determined to regain power at all costs.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to step in to get power and control -- Media reported as a word spoken by the president.

Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsed.
He lost his life later in the hospital.
\"Air Navigor Indonesia,\" said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's  --ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Baikpan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, he lost his life this morning before the helicopter reached Paul.
He added: “This is the word that will cut off our souls.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the local agency for mitigating disaster consequences says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
) It is believed that this number will continue to grow because there were still many bodies under rubble, while others have not been found; said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nuguroho.
The waves that reached up to six metres have destroyed Paluna, where a massive mortar ceremony will be held Friday.
Military and commercial planes are providing supplies and assistance.

The airline running a plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now announced a missing person, having declared before all 47 passengers and the crew safe from the plane diving in water.
In a press release, Air Niugin said on Saturday afternoon they were not finding a passenger.
The airline indicated that she was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators in trying to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requirements for further information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at the island of Chuck.
On Friday, official officials said seven persons had been accompanied to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of confrontation, and the consequences of events itself remain unclear.
Airline and American navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon after failing to reach the track.
Some witnesses thought that the plane crossed the course.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
- That's extremely good.
Jaynes said that through the water that had reached the waist level, he and others managed to achieve the emergency of the plane.
He said the billboards were panicked and screaming while he suffered a slight injury on his head.
The American navy said sailors working in the correcting of a nearby skeleton helped save them, using an airboat to transport people to the shore before the plane dipped to about 30 feet (100 feet) under water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 have lost their lives in crashes of airlines recorded in PNG in the last two decades, but --Air Niugin -- was not involved in either of them.
Analyst builds the night chronology when a woman was burnt alive
On Saturday the prosecution presented its arguments in the retrial of a person who is accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
American Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours in the quality of the expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used phone records to rebuild the defendant's movements, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jesica Chambers, the night this changed lives.
According to reports by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he has received the location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers afternoon of her death, actually the one rejecting his previous claims.
When the data found out that his cell phone was in the same place as that of Chambers while he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to the latter.
Sandford was presented in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that the evening was in Sanford's truck, he said that--he's lying because my truck was in Nashville--
Another discrepanciation is Thellis' statement, who said he had known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone records showed that they had only a week they knew each other.
Rowlett said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis had cleared messages, calls and contact data from his phone.
He wiped it out of his life. Hale said.
The defensive side is designed to provide concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge declared that the jury would make the decision that day.

Another colored man?
The babydo from New York sue the couple for leaving work after receiving the +racist message--
A nanny from New York has indicted a couple for discrimination in his dismissal, having received a message erroneously sent by a mother who lamented that she was-- another colored man--
The couple denied themselves to be racists, considering the indictment as--defensive.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxmann, a mother of two, expressed her concern when she found that the young baby babysitter Giselle Maurice was a colorful woman, at the moment she appeared on the first day of work in 2016.
- YOOOOOOOOOOOOO, A LEARN MEARNED - wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the message.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her gaff, Plasco-Flaxmann,--feeling in embarrassment--killed Mrs. Maurice, with the reasoning that their current nanny, which was African-American, had done a poor job and that instead, she wanted a fillipinian.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her only day of work and was then sent home with a one-capital in his pocket -
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compliance for quitting, and is demanding compensation at $350 a day for a six-month period, which she was hired for, even though without contract.
I want to show them that they shouldn't do such things; she declared on Friday about The Post, adding--I know it's discrimination--
The couple have denied claims that they are racists, saying Maurice's departure was the right move, as they feared they could no longer believe him after they had offended him.
- My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist - said husband Joel Plasco of The Post.
- But would you leave your children in the hands of a person to whom you have been rude, even though wrongly?
Your newborn child?
Tell me.
Considering the indictment as a scout - Plasco said that he and his wife had brought a child, two months ago, and they were in a very difficult situation.
- Can you retaliate against someone in this situation?
It's not a positive thing to do -- said Plasco, investment banker.
While the case has gone to court, public opinion has quickly denounced the couple in social media, criticising them of their conduct and logic.
A new letter shows that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not form connections to a talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s acceptance, expressed about it: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of a person who reads it for the first time before being published.
We feel great pleasure now that we have seen Paddington's extraordinary success--
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the book for children, would have been angry if his work were rejected, adding that 60 years of publication of the book, last year after his death, contained the unhappiness and happiness -
As for Paddington, which she named as a very important member of our family, she added that her father was very proud of success.
She said, \"He was a man who was calm and did not brag.
-Paddington was so real to him that it was the same as having a successful child: You feel proud of him even though it is not exactly your success.
I think that's how he looked at Paddington's success.
Though he was his creation and imagination, he always credited Paddington's own person.
My daughter was changing her life and I was forced to say goodbye by phone
After arriving, her daughter was urgently taken to Louis Pastour 2, Hospital, where doctors had tried to save her life but without results.
She regularly called me to tell me that it was very serious, which she did not believe she would handle, said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
- Then I got a call from Ned that told me she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, \"Teachy, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The drugs that the doctors had given to keep her heart at work were losing the effect and were slowly leaving her system.
She had died a while ago, and now everything was about to be--
I was forced to sit down and wait, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't mourn or scream because I was surrounded by family and people.
I should have been strong.
In time, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane beside other passengers -- who were unaware of what she was experiencing.
She said, \"No one knew,\" she said.
- I kept my head down, and all the time, I was in tears.
It's hard to explain, but on that flight, I felt a great regret for Ned.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her
Women who mourn are posting letters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two females who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from being killed.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted letters with inspiring messages, on a bridge in Wells, as well as phone numbers of people who can call for support.
Mrs. Davis's son was 13 when he started suffering depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
- I don't want no parent to feel the way I feel every day - she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, repossessing in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a smile - thegitation -
- Everyone knew about his smile.
People always said his smile shines every room
However, he gave up his job before changing his life, after it was true dark--
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the person who found his brother after he had committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: \"I constantly worry that there will be a domino effect--
Mrs. Davis created the letters so people can know that there are people who can help and who can talk to, even a friend.
Do not sit in solitary conceives. Do not speak to each other.
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Mrs. Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
- He did not say that he felt sad, depressed, or anything else.
- Some days before Christmas, we noticed the change in conduct.
He was extremely upset on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't see them in the eye, and he didn't do anything.
She said his death was a lot of trauma for them, but that they must exceed: \"It's something that destroys the whole family.
We destroyed us.
But we all have to move forward and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the thread of the Persian after the FBI investigation begins.
- I thought that if we could give him something similar to what he asked for - a limited time investigation into time and object - maybe we could bring some harmony - Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee was disbanding - among the many obstacles of the opponents.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters investigate the FBI?
Their investigation comes as a result of time.
Congress elections are only 5 weeks away, on November 6th - if republics fail, as is expected, they will be greatly weakened in efforts to pick the person they want at the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has called the senators, lobbying for them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him recognised his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
It will be voted in the senate, where there are currently 51 republics and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear if Mr. Kavanaugh could collect at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow vice-president Mike Pence to end this situation and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
Desert number in North Korea under Kim leadership
The number of deserters in North Korea has fallen since Kim Yong came to power seven years ago, a South Korea lawmaker has declared.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Union Ministry in South Korea, has declared there have been some 1127 deserts last year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main factors were the strictest controls on the borders between North Korea and China, as well as the highest tariff demanded by human traffickers.
Peniann didn't make any public comments.
Most deserters from North Korea receive citizenship from South Korea.
Seoul has declared that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korea war in 1953.
The majority leave China, which has the largest border length with North Korea, and there could be more simply compared to the DMZ Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is protected by numerous forces.
China considers migrant deserters illegal, not as refugees, and often repatriates forcefully.
Relationships between North and South Korean - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Penias, and their talks focused on delayed negotiations for denoriation.
This meeting came after the historic meeting of June, between American President Donald Trump and Kim Yong, in Singapore, where they agreed, in general terms, to work for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Rie Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for lack of progress until that moment.
- Without trust in the US, there will be no confidence in national security and under these circumstances, there is no chance that we, unilaterally, first disarmament - was expressed during a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaug-christic) and says he is not worthy to serve at the Supreme Court
The head of the minority at the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelossi, called the name of the High Court Brent Cavanaug - aristic) and said that because of his temper, he was unable to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments Saturday, during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
- I can't think that if a woman had ever been brought like that, people would say 'hysterical,'' said Pelosi of her response to Kavanaugh testimony in front of the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh categorically denied the allegations that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his presentation talk, Kavanaugh was very concerned, and at times she almost screamed or was squealed — talking about his family and high school years.
He accused the Democrats expressedly before the committee, calling the charges against him as -- a grotesk assassination and co-ordinated to his image -- organised by angry liberals from Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi expressed her opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony constituted evidence that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, since she showed his prejudice to the Democrats.
- I think he criminalised himself with those statements and how he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats -- she said.
Pelosi hesitated to answer the question if he would try to give Kavanaug a no-confidence motion in case of his appointment, and if the Democrats win most of the countries in the House of Representatives.
- Let me tell you -- if he's not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's unskillable not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where it is now -- Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Appeal Court in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as democrats, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Law for Constitutive Constitution or on the Roy issue against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In sessions for his appointment, Cavanaugh avoided questions about abolishing the specific decisions of the Supreme Court.
- It is not the time for a hysterical and unilateral person to become a member of the court and to expect us to say - [it] well - said Pelosi.
And women must use it.
This is a fair verbal attack, months and years of rage that explodes, and it cannot lead to the end without crying.
- We cry when we become angry - Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
- I don't think that's weird.
She went on, \"I was greatly helped by a woman who worked in a presiding position, who said she was also crying when she was angry, but she had invented a style that every time she got angry and started to cry, she could say to the cohabitors, \"I could think I'm bored and so I'm crying.
But I'm really angry.
And then she kept talking.
And I thought it was a brilliant idea--
Tears are a way of expressing heart, in part because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an old job, in an office where males dominated, and at some point I found myself crying from inconsistent resentment, was the moment when a older woman grabbed me to the throat -- a cold manager who I've always been afraid of--and pushed me to the stairs.
- never let others see you crying, she said to me.
- They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset, and they're gonna be glad that they could annoy you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a democrat member of Congress from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his candidacy for the President.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found in the middle of an extramarital relationship on a board of a known boat -Monkey Business - and got out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, extremely angry, realized that there was no reason not to intend for president himself.
- This was not a well - thought - out decision - she told me smiling, 30 years later.
- In the race were already seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was a more candidate.
Someone called him the Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
Since the campaign was in its final stages, it was left after the collection of funds, so he vowed he would not compete if he failed to collect $2 million.
But it was a futile war.
She found out some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, she was given only $250.
- Do you think I get a discount? - She asked herself.
During the talk that he announced that he would not have an official campaign, she was so emotionally overcrowded — grateful for the people who supported him, the anger with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and conducting voters instead of delegates, and the anger of sexism - that she drowned.
- It seemed that I had suffered a neural crisis - reminded Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to it.
- It looked like Kleenex was my sponsoring corporation.
I remember thinking what people would write on my gravestone?
She wept.
US-China Trade War advantages for Beijing
The first generation of commercial warfare between the United States and China were deafening, and as the war is aborted, a split between the two countries could pose advantages for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, setting taxes on main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most sensitive escalating was the one that happened this week, when new fees touched goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of the goods that went into the US from China.
Beijing has been hacked every time - nature - eventually by putting fees from five to ten percent to ten billion dollars of American goods.
China has pledged to return the US to the same currency, and the second largest economic power in the world is unlikely to surrender soon.
Removing the measures from Washington means giving in to their demands, but for China President Xi Jinping, it would be very embarrassing to be publicly humiliated before the United States.
However, experts voiced that if China plays its letters properly, the pressures coming from commercial war with the United States could positively support China in long term, to reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
The fact that political decisions taken rapidly both in Washington and Beijing could cause economic decline in each of these countries is a far more dangerous thing than what is seen from abroad - said Abigail Grace, a researcher and assisted in the new American security centre, which focuses on the Asian continent.
Syria 'ready' for refugee returns, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the land destroyed by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouallem said conditions in the country are improving.
Today, the situation in the country is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Currently, there are all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to their homeland, from which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that struck their daily lives and their welfare.
The UN estimates that about 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war, in 2011.
About six million others still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Mouale said the Syrian regime would welcome the help to rebuild the destroyed state.
But he stressed that the country would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins the trophy of -Ryder Cup - in Paris
Europe's team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 trophy after defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5, in Le Golf National, at the exit of Paris, France.
The US has already lost six ranking matches on European territory, and it has since 1993 that wins this trophy in Europe.
Europe regained the crown after the Danish captain's team, Thomas Bjorn, managed to receive 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who was the most difficult player in the tournament, took the first blow to the water and closed the 16th pit with 3 shots more than the set level, losing the match in front of Francesco Molinar.
Italian golf player Moliner shone in all its rounds, becoming 1 of the four players who have reached the score of 5-0-0, since the current format began to apply in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by the European team's lowest ranking player, Danesze Thorbjorn Olesen.
World ranking player Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to the English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last final of the Ryder Cup.
Spanish Veteran Sergio Garcia, who played on eight Ryder Cup, became the most successful European player of all time on this tournament, with 25.5 points in the career.
(Laughter) I don't cry, but today I can't support myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so, so glad we re-entryed the cup.
Success is of the team, and I'm happy to have the opportunity to help them - Garcia said quite excited after winning the European team.
He passed his word to his countrymen, John Ram, who defeated the American golf legend, Tiger Woods, in direct challenges on Sunday.
I feel a tremendous pride that I defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that player,\" said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his matches in France and now there are statistics 13-21-3, during his career at Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics from one of the biggest players of all times, which has won 14 important titles, ranking second after Jack Nicklaus.
The US team faced difficulties all weekend to take the ball to the right place, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high caliber golf throughout the tournament.
The captain of the United States, Jim Furyk, spoke after the disappointing presentation of his team, \"I'm proud of these guys\" -- they fought hard.
There were moments during this morning when we exercised pressure on the European team.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played pretty well.
We're gonna regroup, work with PGA in America, as well as our Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We need to get his hat back.
They play better than we are.
