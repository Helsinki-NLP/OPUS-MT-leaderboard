Members of the Wales Country Assembly concerned with “passing for puppets”
Welsh electors are dismayed by a proposal to replace their title with the acronym MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment of the name of the Assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of railing.
An elected worker said that his group was concerned that the acronym "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who are not from Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotte.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative Party would be "open" to a change of name, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionette), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English of the Yorkshire region.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing the legislation introducing the change of name, stated that “the final decision on the designation of members of the Assembly belongs to the latter”.
The Government of Wales Act, 2017, 2007 empowers the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which was largely supported.
On the issue of membership titles, the Commission is in favour of Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a vast majority of Welsh prefers MWP.
Other suggestions appear to be made by members of the Assembly, but efforts to reach a consensus could prove to be a real headboard for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a bill on the change of name in the coming weeks.
Reform legislation will include further amendments to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the issue of the name during the discussions on the bill.
Macedonia: Referendum on the modification of the country name
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be known as the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a disputeful age of several decades between the country and its Greek neighbour, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted on the fact that the name of Macedonia constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on its neighbouring country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said that he would not take into account the results.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the change of name is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, Saint Martin bells silenced
"The old people I discussed with say that traditionally there was a bar and a church in every corner of the street," says Adams.
"There is no more of it today."
According to him, it's normal that the bars have gone down.
Today, "we don't get together the same way," he explains.
"We used to go to the bar as well as to his neighbor, but that's not the case anymore."
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted long before what the leaders imagine, and this worries him: " sooner or later, they will return to the home."
He adds that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help to maintain the last sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
"The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be in large part of the Whites who will rush the closure of all churches, because it is unlikely that they will become members," he is concerned.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built both churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The original white Methodist Congregation left the premises in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which preached nearby, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was resumed by a black community under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which Blacks were looking to get used or to get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire devastated the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon,
that Father Johnson's son and successor to the Church of Saint Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the "poor people's bells".
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave her a different name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentions that it is the first carillon to the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather claims Saint Martin didn't replace him.
Over the past few months, there has been a lot of talk about the renovation of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the lay elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter wished to impose the costs incurred, although he did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: A 13-year-old boy injured by a shark during a lobster fishing party
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old young man last Saturday while he was fishing for lobster in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, San Diego's television channel, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream with help and began to pay up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy was crying out for joy of having had a hold, and then he realized that in reality he
had been bitten.
On arriving near the young man, Hammel noticed that he presented an open fracture of the clavicle.
"I cried for everyone to come out of the water: There's a shark!" Chad said.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The shark species at the origin of the attack are unknown.
At a press conference, the rescue chief Larry Giles informed that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the torso.
The authorities have closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad until the beach of Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 shark species, but most of them are considered non-hazardous.
Saninsbury's offensive plans in the British aesthetics market
Sainsbury's hand is low on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and garnished with rays similar to those of supermarkets, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by field experts.
As a result of a major breakthrough in the UK aesthetics market of 2.8 billion pounds sterling, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and household goods are falling, wider beauty product rays will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience proves conclusive.
Supermarkets now invest in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's indicated that it would increase the volume of its offers to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of untested products on animals, an ever-increasing criterion among young consumers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfumer will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, and a second that is scheduled to open in the course of the year to Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders need to get their heads up to attract consumers, who increasingly tend to shop online and go to nearby shops for daily food.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive Officer of Sainsbury's, said that sales outlets will increasingly look like large areas, as the supermarket chain tries to counter the discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has enabled sales of common consumer goods to be propelled and to make acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempts to restructure the rays of pharmaceutical and cosmetic articles of the British chain had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended with a controversy over the distribution of the benefits of pharmacies in supermarkets.
It was after 3 years of selling its 281 pharmacies for an amount of 125 million pounds sterling in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds had to play a role in it, which was to introduce in 4 stores a wide range of high-end skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been modified to improve the framework for customers.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can provide wise advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the beautification of our rays and the ideal situation of our institutions, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now indisputable and changes purchasing habits," said Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal of an £11 million deal
Curroux de la estar du programe televisé Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of the cheerleader Holly Willoughby from a contract of £11 million related to his home decoration mark, to dedicate himself to his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to deal with the inside decoration mark and Truly accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
When she was 37 years old, This Morning's animator announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by withdrawing from their fruitful textile activity and interior decoration at the last minute, to dedicate himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources stated that Jones was furious when the dear child on TV revealed, during a meeting that was under tension at the headquarters of the Dragon's Den Star Trade empire in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), that his new contracts, up to 1.5 million pounds sterling, no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their brand of decoration and interior accessories.
The Truly brand was similar to that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the animator's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, aged 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into her private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside of Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities
and is ensuring its future for the next 2 decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could imagine what was going to happen Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow's seat is full of ready-to-sell products."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning's animator, who is among the most "bankable" celebrities in Britain, could cause millions to be lost to society, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, to underwear or interior items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
Moreover, it could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, had been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, aged 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples were on vacation together and Peter Jones holds 40% of the share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby should become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as animator of the I'm A Celebrity ITV program.
A source close to Jones said last night that he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was loud, but finally we love each other.
Trump ridiculed the media who criticized him because of his comment that some consider "unworthy of a president", and to show themselves so positive to the North Korean leader.
"Why has President Trump yielded so much?"
He joined in taking a voice as a TV journalist.
"I didn't give in at all."
He indicated that Kim Jong-un had expressed support for the holding of a second meeting, after Trump qualified the first meeting, which took place in Singapore in June, from a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on this denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than 3 months after the June summit in Singapore, the head of North Korean diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, declared on Saturday to world leaders, at the United Nations General Assembly, no "corresponding response" from the United States to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his Trump gathering speech, he offers a much more optimistic outlook.
"It's all right with North Korea," said the North American President.
We have betrayed the armed conflict.
"Millions of people were reportedly killed.
We now have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the remains of North American soldiers returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this full arena to crack, there's hardly more than 200 standing in front of me," he criticized him pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, aid from foreign NGOs was not supposed to be necessary.
More than 10 per cent of the Lombok population has been scattered, but no state of national disaster has been decreed, a condition required for the initiation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often clearly stated that they do not want international aid, which makes things a little complicated," said Mrs. Subuk.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to go to Palu, she still does not know if work on the ground will be allowed.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian assistance.
Despite the constant shocks, the country lacks the means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Refugee shelters have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning has been issued, no alarm sirens have resounded at Palu, which has probably contributed to human losses.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not a simple thing.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been sent to Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the sites of the new disaster.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, placed the infrastructure reform in the centre of his electoral campaign and spent considerable money on restoring roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has undermined Mr. Joko's government, who was called upon to represent himself in front of the electors next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives, and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes, in the midst of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool Attacker Daniel Sturridge manages to equalize against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a defeat in Liverpool in the First League against Chelsea, marking at the 89th minute on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres away from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led from 1 to 0.
He shoots in the ball on his left, before he escapes a shot to the second pole.
The balloon flew over the repair surface before heading to the top right corner of the net.
The ball ends up reaching Kepa Arrizabalaga and ends its road at the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to get around, take a ball, but players like Shaq always pull as far as possible, so I tried to make a maximum of time," Sturridge confides at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching to control and without really thinking much I decided to shoot."
Chelsea was leading 1 to 0 in the middle after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard at the 25th minute.
The attacker of the Blues scored a pass towards Mateo Kovacic, before moving to the middle of the field and sprinting side Liverpool.
Kovacic realized a quick journey and comes in the middle of the field,
Then he made a beautiful deep shot that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard passed the defense and finished his race in the net of the second pole, with a shot from the left foot behind the doorman of the Liverpool, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitains in the Champions League group phase, Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in Europe UEFA League, at 3 p.m. this Thursday in London.
Indonesia: The number of tsunami victims is 832
The disaster management agency reported on Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami balance reported 832 deaths.
Many inhabitants are trapped under the debris of the buildings destroyed by the magnitude of the 7.5 earthquake that shook the country Friday and triggered waves of 6 meters high, informed the spokesman of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency at a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was surrounded by wrecked buildings.

The police urge the residents of the neighborhood who would have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
The police captain, Brian O'Hagan, made the following statements: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask any person near John Street in Birkenhead who would have seen or heard anything suspected of contacting us.
I call particularly taxi drivers, who could have caught something on their dashcam and ask them to provide us with any information crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property in which she lived.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman presented themselves at the crime scene and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is ongoing and the police indicated that it informed the parents close to the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, the police do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him voiceless.

Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
His ban would be the fair return of things, in the light of acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural property in England, committed by his Puritan supporters, such as fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it "revisionist attempt".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, states that "since the current debate surrounding the withdrawal of statues, it was evident that Oliver Cromwell's one erected in front of the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell did not order or conduct iconoclasm during the English civil wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration that we had for him in the 19th century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Mr. Goldsmith said in the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of the parliament against external pressures, I mean of course the monarchy.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents one side of the fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated."
China: Pig Kills a Farmer · Global Voices
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeast China.
Identifyed as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery trenched and covered with blood near a porcelain on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, indicated on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject swine vaccines into a pig shop on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the nearby porch was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and blood flowed from his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the animal weighs 250 kg mutilated the farmer to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the farmer's cousin, said that "his legs were crushed and covered with blood."
The security cameras show Mr. Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig at the origin of Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to the farmer or his cousin.
One market manager told Evening News that the animal was locked up to prevent any other incident and allow police to collect evidence.
The farmer's family Mr. Yuan and the market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks on people have already been reported.
In 2016 in a farm in Massachusetts, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband, seriously hurting her.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig caught a Welsh breeder on his tractor before his wife managed to get him away.
In 2012, while an Oregon breeder had just been devoured by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that it was not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
"These are rather game animals,
very curious kids... they have no intention of harming.
Just show them the respect they owe them," he says.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeast of the United States
In accordance with the forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the colder waters of the north-east coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause rains in northeastern Mexico and southwest of the United States over the next few days.
The winds were at 135 km/h (Category 1 hurricane) since 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, while Rosa was at 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
During this time, depression begins to form above the Pacific Ocean and flows eastward to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday in storm form, Hurricane Rosa will lead to intense tropical humidity to the North in the southwestern United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in regions of Mexico this Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the near depression will create generalized torrential rains in the South-West in the coming days.
At the local level, precipitations reaching between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause sudden raw hazards, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
The showers will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per location, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in southwest regions, including a large part of Arizona.
Dispersed tropical rains may cause sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is highly discouraged to venture in the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rains could convert canyons into chained rivers and storms will produce wind gusts and dust whirlwinds in locations.
The near depression will give rise to abundant local rains in some southern parts of the country, on the Californian coast.
The total rainfall can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could result in low debris flows and make the pavement slippery.
This could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Tropical spills will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, and will intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
High rainfall will fall to four corners of Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Important changes in temperature are expected for the month of October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
which sometimes leads to a radical change in time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will suffer considerable temperature gaps on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will attempt to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the central and eastern United States should experience a hot start of October, with temperatures around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other regions of the northeast.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average of the season.
The multi-day forecasts indicate that temperatures should be above average in the eastern United States during the first 15th of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
On 6 television stations on Thursday, the impressive hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse continues, the broadcast services interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a theatrical coup: an agreement imagined by Jeff Flake, the Arizona Senator, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
In front of the Senate's Judicial Commission, Christine Ford assured 100% that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had given up on her person and had tried to remove her clothes during a high school night.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, also claimed to be 100% certain that it had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial has probably reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels spreading the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people who watch TV in the office.
By comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose facilitators widely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most watched channel on the day of the hearings, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC held second place with a hearing reaching 3.26 million.
CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still according to Nielsen.
Interest did not weaken once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama playing Friday.
After the Bureau of the Moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator was taken part by protesters while attempting to take the elevator to the court hearing.
Flake lowered her eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of live interrogation.
"Don't look anywhere else, look at me," launches one of the women.
"Do you really believe he's telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are poor."
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and said more during the committee meeting.
All the wired and broadcast network channels would cover the meeting on-line a few hours later, while the judicial commission was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh by the whole Senate.
Flake indicated, however, that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on charges against the candidate, which the minority Democrats claimed.
Flake was partly convinced by discussing with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after he met with Coons and several other senators later.
His choice weighed heavily in the balance, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without a prior inquiry.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault charges.
Britain: May accuses opponents in Brexit of making the "little policy"
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his project of leaving the European Union, of making the "little policy" to the detriment of the future of Great Britain and the national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May in cover, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "beyond ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the LSU player's death
The police arrested a fatal shot suspect who killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, was beaten and charged with murder in the second degree, indicated Baton Rouge police service.
The authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police indicated that Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the crime scene, the glasses wore Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
In his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police to be responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The office of the medical examiner of the parish of Baton-Rouge published a preliminary report Friday, which determines that death was caused by an injury by a bullet that crossed the head and stayed in the neck.
The Police Service recognizes the assistance received by the Fugitive Task Force of Louisiana State, the State Police Medical and Legal Laboratory, the Southern University Police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the law enforcement forces for their "commitment and search for justice".
Sims was only 20.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew to Baton-Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, it scored 5.6 points and performed 2.6 rebounds per match during the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, the LSU basketball coach said the team was "damaged and shocked" after the news of Wayde's death.
"We postpone this kind of event all the time," Wade regretted.
Mexico: A Volcano Cracked Ash
From the ashes escaping from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Disaster Reduction recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano, after having recorded a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The centre monitored several earthquakes and earthquakes from Popocatepetl.
On social media, the images showed fine layers of ash covering windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano level located 72 km from the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between the police and separatists in the approach to the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independent protesters and the riot police, while thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being repelled by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder at them, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not deplete tourists.
Heat spills also broke out later in the day, while the police used matraques to contain the clashes.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence who scandaled "not forgetting, nor forgiving" have faced unionist supporters crying "long-lived in Spain".
14 demonstrators with minor injuries were treated, according to the local press.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considered illegal but celebrated by Catalans in favor of separation, tensions remain alive in the independentist region.
A overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low participation rate, the opponents of secession who largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling offices in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
It was the same place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he had no hope for Catalonia's independence.
"We witnessed last year at a great time.
My parents cried with joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in an impasse," he lamented.
Despite their capital victory, albeit thin, in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independent parties had a hard time maintaining momentum this year, many popular leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for organizing the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who films the demonstration of support for the police on his phone, judges that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on both sides.
"The tension is only rising," he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the 9 Catalan leaders in prison awaiting a trial since last year, announced his intention to submit his candidacy to the elections of the European Parliament next year.
"It is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression triggered by the Spanish government," he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men go through a house by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after having sunk several times on a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings indicated that the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would also have received arrow shots.
Livingston wins match 1 to 0 against the Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal assures Livingston's victory
Recently raised in rank, Livingston's team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second victory in 18 games at Steven Gerrard, the current coach at the Ibrox Club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place themselves in 2nd place of the ranking, equally with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside of Premiership's league this season, and must face the Hearts team on Sunday, which carries 8 points.
But first, the Rangers will meet the Rapid of Vienna on the occasion of the League of Europe on Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, it has extended its invincible course of 6 games in the division, and its main coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, may take care that he hasn't lost the slightest encounter yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity in the face of angry opponents
Holt's team could have taken a long time to make a mark, because their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to pierce but remained enthralled in front of the opposing goal; followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass by Craig Halkett.
Livingston's team let the Rangers own the ball, knowing that it could hinder them by working tactics.
That's where the decisive purpose came in.
The Rangers gave a free shot and the Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allied themselves to reach Menga, who took a touch and set a goal in the middle of the field.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves faced with an impenetrable defense and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was only rarely worried.
The second half-time experienced the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly arrest.
The ranger Allan McGregor stopped a hit by Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to play one of Livingston's plans.
The Livingston guard rejected all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were denied by the arbitrator, one for the Halkett provocation directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a failure of hand.
Livingston's "F phenomenon" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and stunning results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and composition of the team have almost not changed since their return to the summit, but the merit largely goes to Holt for having since its arrival motivated a team
which includes many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grand and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall inhale throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level with Gerrard, they were not up to their past talent.
They missed one last chance and were able to pierce the opposing side only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Mixed Home of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
Various issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in his country.
The cleavage that emerges from the protests reflects Erdogan's double vision: a visitor welcomed in heroes by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at about 10.15 local hours, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the rescue arrived on site, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
The London Police stated that officers were doing everything to identify the individual and to prevent his or her relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been established. Motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 officers injured in a riot
The high-security prison officer said that six prison officers were injured in a riot.
The riot began in HMP Long Lartin Prison, located in Worcestershire, about 09h30 local time this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Specialized riot officers were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
On site, officers were treated for slight facial injuries.
A prison management spokesperson said: "Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order to HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. Those responsible will have to respond to the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences prolonged."
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered the most dangerous in the country, are imprisoned in HM Long Lartin Prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized as a result of an assault by a prisoner.
Last October, riot officers were sent to prison to prevent a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked personnel with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden floods (which could be beneficial for areas affected by drought)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but that is what will probably happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading for the southwest desert with what is left of energy. This region may be affected by sudden floods.
The national weather service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada, the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head straight to Phoenix Tuesday, with rains announcing from Monday night.
The Phoenix-based national weather service stated in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have kept the stage of depression or tropical storm within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stopped at 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates at the National Hurricane Center include 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per location in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest desert including the Rocky Central Area and the Grand Basin are expected to record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measurements up to 10 cm.
Rosa's rains could be lifesaving for drought-affected areas that are not exposed to the risk of sudden flooding.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, the rain could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. Drought Surveillance System, just over 40% of Arizona has at least one extreme category drought, the second most serious category," says weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa begins her journey along the coast, in the peninsula of Basse-California.
Always with a great power on Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moved north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane on Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some regions of Mexico, precipitation could be massive and could lead to a flood risk.
"In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation are expected from Lower California to the north-west of Sonora and will reach up to 25 cm," saidweather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico to the north, with the strength of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border on Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and southern Utah in the Tuesday evening.
"Red rains are expected in Lower California, north-west of Sonora and the southwest desert and are the main danger," said the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially deadly sudden floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder, after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 4am local time.
He was sent to the hospital, and his condition is currently stable.
The Avon and Sommerset police reported arresting the four young people (age 17, 18 and 20) in the night on the Radstock side.
Officers made a call to people who might have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump states that Kavanaugh has been the victim of the evil and anger of the Democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a gathering in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been the victim of the evil and anger of the Democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh spoke to the Congress on Thursday, rejecting with energy and emotion Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president declared on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage" today.
"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service," he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when he referred to the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I fight on every front for great candidates."
Trump said the Democrats were on the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first vote of decisive procedure in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should be held by Friday, according to the statement by a member of the Republican Party at CNN.
Indonesia: One earthquake and tsunami make hundreds of victims, the balance sheet continues to grow
On Saturday, the authorities stated that at least 384 people had died, most of them carried by huge waves that fell on the beaches while an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves six meters high submerged the beach at nightfall. They took many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The magnitude of the 7.5 earthquake preceded the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not flee immediately, it cost them their lives," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't happen alone. He trained cars, wooden pieces, dwellings, he took everything with him," Nugroho explained, stating that the tsunami had moved in the middle of the sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by climbing to the trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The air images published by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and stores, damaged and sunken bridges, as well as a water-surrounded mosque.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (PPPT) stated that the energy released by the Friday earthquake was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have widened the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Some bodies were found stuck under the debris of buildings in ruins, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that human and material losses could be greater over 300 km north of Palu, a region called Donggala, closest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely paralyzed" since Donggala," Nugroho said.
Over 300,000 people live there," La Croix Rouge said in a communiqué, adding that his staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could well worsen," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not disseminating the information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials stated that the waves had arrived as soon as the alert was published.
A shared amateur video on social networks shows a man upstairs of a building shouting frantically to street passers-by that a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a water wall fell on the coast, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power failure that cut off all communications in Palu, so it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began to provide aid by cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated persons still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has reopened in rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: The tsunami victims' balance is rising, with over 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
The Donggala World Vision staff arrived healthy and except in Palu, where they found refuge in shelters located in the courtyard of their offices. On the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, explains Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to provide relief to the disaster victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
"This disaster is still considered regional," says Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares that it is a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing persons were still hoping for a miracle.
Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been buried in the rubble for two days, near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, Gendon Subandono, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Others of his students found themselves trapped in Roa Roa Hotel, added M. Mandagi.
"As an old man in the discipline of paragliding, I have experienced my own dramas," he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliding community, Mr. Gendon reported that he had desperately sent messages WhatsApp to athletes in Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
His messages were left unanswered.
"I think they've never received my messages."
In Newport on the Levee, thieves subtilize $26,750 when charging an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, thieves towed $26,750 to a Brink's agent who was charging an automatic distributor at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Service.
The driver of the vehicle killed a distributor in the entertainment complex and prepared to feed it, explains Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses reportedly noticed many suspects leaving the premises, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
The kidnapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: " Formerly known as Kanye West."
41-year-old West, who has been called Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before he went to the Saturday Night Live show, where he was supposed to present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaced that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his arrival for "emotional reasons," explained the creator of the show.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current pseudo-professional, this nickname also has a religious significance for West.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "you," explained West earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us.
I went from Kanye, which means "the only one," to Ye - it reflects good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who collaborated with West in the past, also played on the union trait and the capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO states that military force will never be used against civilians.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians, almost fifty years after bloody reprisals of law enforcement forces against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco's place "never use military force to suppress the Mexican people."
On 2 October 1968, the troops opened fire during a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people when student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed to supporting Mexican youth by giving monthly allowances to students and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this sector, according to the investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several US government actors have made announcements about AI, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its road map last year: it plans to become the innovation leader AI by 2030.
"Coupling funds for AI research would be a good start, because all other countries have a long lead on the United States, and we're looking for the next big discovery in AI," says Lee.
Double funding could double the chances that the next key step in the U.S. AI area, said Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an AI system that beat American Othello's best-ranking player. He then joined Microsoft Research's management team and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has already participated in technological competitions organized by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and has asked when the next competition would take place in order to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, US researchers often have to work hard to obtain government funding.
"It is not China that is appropriate for academic leaders, it is companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited large university names to work on AI.
Lee added that the changes in immigration policies could also support United States AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to AI researchers," he says.
The State Affairs Council of China unveiled its new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the Department of Defence of the United States established an Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve industry and academic partners. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year for AI research.
At the same time, the US legislation working to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on their country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia heard their voices in a referendum on the change of their country's name for the Republic of North Macedonia, and this change would resolve an old dispute of several decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of the provinces of Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right in its territory and opposed its veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would affect the ethical identity of the slave population in Macedonia, the majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote during the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts as to whether a minimum participation of 50% was required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was as follows: "Are you for accession to NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid to join organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which have been overcome by the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that she can live freely under the aegis of the European Union, which means a safer life for each of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have stated that they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But the participation was only 16%, while it had reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 that had mobilized 66% of the voters registered after the vote.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name, in order to open the voice to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In Parliament, in Skopje, Vladimir Kavarvarkov, 54, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter it through the big door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments, with unemployment in the country exceeding 20%.
"I think that a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he filed his newsletter.
He added that "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43% of voters would intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated participation at 57%.
70% of voting participants said they would vote "yes."
For the referendum to be valid, it takes 50 per cent of the votes plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-West Government's policy since its seizure in May last year.
Decisive action: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, breaks a path through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defenders in Manchester and won the game 2-0 Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
The goal of Aguero, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine Butter received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green sweaters.
He went around a defender before stopping the others close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English front took advantage of it to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to deceive Brighton's keeper, Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiola, the team coach, to the journalists.
"We said he'd be 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at the time."
But it was Sterling who had given the initial advantage to the Skyblues during the First League match,
From the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on Brighton's field.
He sent him to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few keys before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before sliding out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play trouble parties against the Rockies
As the Nationals team was eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to start in a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Rockies of Colorado, but only in case of an eliminatory game for the Rockies, of real legends facing the Los Angeles Dodgers of the Western Division of the National League.
The Rockies took it 5-2 in front of the Nationals Friday evening, but they are still trying to secure their first division title.
"Although this game is not at stake, we want to wander the ground in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and in the face of a team that will probably be playing at the highest level I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce a launcher leaving for Sunday, but they would be inclined to leave the place in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th departure, will be in training Thursday and will launch on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The Washington Right is 18-7 with an average of 2,53 and 300 withdrawals on track in 220 marches and two-thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation that generated his support to Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by discussing the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's a major issue. I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever. That's why I'm fighting on every front for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible radical group, really horrible, democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
Democrats are on the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see it in the last four days," he added, before calling the Democrats of people "enraged, wicked and lying."
He referred to the Justice Committee of the United States Senate and Senator Democrat Dianne Feinstein, which was worthy of public praise.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm expecting one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it was.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When activists from the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of parliamentarians from the Labour Party who are considered not to be welcome, all for having expressed our ideas.
My Parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated the same way because she stood up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was convicted because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The nottingham East Labour rally notification Friday said: "We want the gathering to be inclusive and productive."
That's exactly what the Friday evening general assemblies were for my eight years as a Labour Party Member.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case with many meetings and the promise of smoother and more respectful policies has long been forgotten if it has never been taken into account.
It has become clear that opposing opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party's leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy took over, and colleagues with whom I thought I would share the same political vision began to wait for me to return my jacket and take positions against my beliefs, whether regarding national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, I was following an abusive bias on social networks, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were addressed to me were of a political nature.
I am in admiration for the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a detachment of sexist or racist remarks every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most disappointing things in the current policy is the standardization of various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party restricts itself in the course of the defiance motions and changes in the rules of selection.
I have been given a lot of advice in the last two years: lowering my eyes, not expressing my ideas so loud, and everything will go well.
But it is not to act as I do in politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolman, because the negligence of Thatcher's government had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as local advisor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with the current party leaders.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion Friday is that the country goes to a Brexit that will affect the homes, businesses and public services. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy by discussing my loyalty to the party's leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether they are workers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes I defend, which are your interests to all.
Chris Leslie is a member of parliament for the electoral district of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr remains inconceivable
Two late trials may have failed the final result, but no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day game of the rugby Scotland Championship at XV.
The team now occupies the top of the ranking and becomes the only invincible team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defence and the way they seize the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate himself on this game.
"So far, we have been tested, but we are invincible, so I must be happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, congratulated Ayr: "Good to them, they were more effective than us and knew how to seize the opportunities."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for Scottish Wing Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to have the figures spoken. Jason Baggot took on an unprocessed trial.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of the day. He scored and transformed a solo trial to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose started the second half-time and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
He followed a long wait due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left the ground on a civière. At the recovery, Ayr resumed his fronts with a trial of Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, then received a yellow cardboard and, again, Melrose tried his chance with an unprocessed test by Bruce Colvine, who created a palpable tension.
But the home team recovered in hand and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting Climo while he did not have the ball, from the touch of the penalty, MacPherson hit the back of Ayr's maul, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the trial, as almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregor Henry's wing away for the fifth home team test.
Still Game Star Launches in Restoration
Ford Kieran, Still Game's star, decided to make a career in the restaurant. The comedian was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man incarnates Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-animates with his long-standing partner on stage, Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the ninth series that comes will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source from the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to become involved in the "floating environment of restoration" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, blocked, hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Marines patrol in an armored boat in the La Paz naval headquarters.
Public buildings bear a blue flag like the ocean.
From Titicaca Lake to Amazonia, the naval bases show the following bike: "The sea is back to us right.
Recovery is a duty."
Throughout the blocked Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to the benefit of Chile during a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still well present. Just like the desire to sail on the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so clear for decades, and Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be delivered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the International Court of Justice's decision on a large-screen basis throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will take action in favour of Bolivia's demand. Bolivia wishes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile should be required to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial struggle for re-election next year), also has much to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
"We are so close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think that there is little chance that the court will speak in favour of Chile, and that few things would change, even in case of a positive decision.
The United Nations instance based in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant a Chilean territory, and stated that it would not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice renders its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case "was not complicated," explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may even have harmed her.
"The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The rhetorical warrior of Morales has undermined all the good Chilean will that remained, she has suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very complicated to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making of the Court was abnormally rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - which remains to date one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political beequile.
"Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must get rid of the past."
North Korea affirms that nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, said that his country would not rely on its nuclear weapons until he had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at the time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed about to relaunch nuclear diplomacy in the impasse more than three months after the Singapore Summit with Kim Jong Un, current North Korea leader.
Ri states that it is "chimeric" to believe that the maintenance of sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration that will put an end to the Korean war will cause the North to fold.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of prior significant disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang's serious resignation from an arsenal that the country considers as the only guarantee of its security is a debate.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month, to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion parades reveal the latest trends in top cover, perhaps soon available in your shops
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect from the sun at 100%, don't look again.
The creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of dazzling oversized hats during a PE19 parade that honored the fashion week style of Paris.
More extravagant hats that each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their dazzling pieces into the parades.
Valentino's light piece was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a wide edge referring to a feather, which swallowed the heads of the mannequins.
The other oversized accessories included jewelry parquets, a witch hat and even a pineapple. But these pieces were not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had the lips sewn and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than Haute-Couture.
One creation was similar to a diving equipment, with tuba and glasses, while another made to think of a melted ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you're lucky.
According to style observers, imposing hats could come up to your shopping streets.
The XXL hats follow the wake of the "Bomba", the broad straw hat that the stars take off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this difficultly portable hat that has flooded social networks presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and a handle of white leather, was the master piece of the PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in the shops for the next summer. The creator has so marked the spirits that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a school record of excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results enhanced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (CIS) strive to offer the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen career and their place as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education capable of designing and implementing a tailored school curriculum, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, you speak to his heart."
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relationships and establish a relationship of trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the excellent results at the reviews this year, it is found that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the most important success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign languages obtained the highest score, A.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students obtained the highest grade, A, Mandarin, as well as the 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Today, languages as subjects are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A survey by the British Employment and Skills Commission conducted in 2014 shows that 17% of the difficulties faced by employers in recruiting candidates are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more language-needing job offers, these skills are essential in our globalised world.
Regardless of their choice of career, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future through this sustainable competence.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a YouGov survey conducted in 2013 among 4,000 adults living in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not master a foreign language enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
Speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will be given a better chance of finding rewarding employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important to the United Kingdom in 2020, including Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with a specialist in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what future reserves them.
It is clear that at present, in a global trading environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do this right.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make its debut with the Lakers Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who watch LeBron James's beginnings at Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' coach, announced that James would play Sunday, in pre-season opening, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we still don't know how many minutes he'll be playing.
"More than one, less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably be playing for a few limited minutes.
After the training, earlier in the week, James was asked for his pre-season projects, which include six games.
"At this stage in my career, I don't need pre-season games to be ready."
Trump Campaigns in Virginia-Western (Tubian Chain)
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other steps, particularly in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the President is popular, are planned.
Since the vote to confirm the vacancy to the Supreme Court was postponed, Trump seeks to obtain support for the upcoming mid-term elections and to prevent the Republicans from losing control of Congress during the vote in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. (East time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of the hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed to one week during the FBI's investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping Republicans gain ground for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the President of North America stated in his campaign that the five meetings aimed to "encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives".
"Congress control is such an essential element of its program that the President will be able to do as many states as possible in this early campaign of election responsible," said Reuters, a spokesperson of the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's meeting, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw attention to Pittsburgh's media."
Saturday, it will be the second trip in a month of Trump to West Virginia, a state that he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the Western Virginia Senate, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to relaunch it in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team is ready to fight to keep hope in the approach of Sunday simples
After three simple, Saturday afternoon forsoms could well represent what was missing at this Ryder Cup.
The momentum balance movement is an invented sport concept of all pieces but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever in tournaments such as this one.
So where would they put the momentum now?
"They were driving six points ahead and now four, so we get a little wings," Jordan Spieth said while he was leaving for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel a little windy and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day long and can take care of getting each three out of four points.
Spieth has shown himself to be terribly effective from tea to green and gives the example.
The screams of energetic joy intensified as his game progressed. A crucial putt allowed him to equalize the fourth part while Thomas and he were taking two down after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the game in the 15th hole, aroused a similar scream, from those who tell you that he believed the American team still in high school.
"We really need to stay determined and focus on his game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left to each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as evidenced by the history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four in four matches and is not entitled to error.
Not only "Moliwood" were the only ones not to realize a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped it Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd deliriously designate them as players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to win a potential European victory while the sun lies on the National Golf.
Instead, both at the same time with different holes.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, hero of the morning's fourballs, while he was teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spaniard and the Swedish into a hole they could never emerge from.
On the other hand, no one's here on Sunday to help you.
The fourballs and forsomes are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and those they don't give, and how a strategy can slide into a blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has made considerable progress during the last day, but this forsomes session has also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubt, especially in the country.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a strong advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 on the United States during Saturday's fourballs and forsomes.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories on a distress Tiger Woods, which allowed them to score four points so far.
Well determined to keep the title she lost in Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn made the difference by imposing himself 3-1 during morning nightballs, in front of a disordered American team.
The United States has shown greater resistance in forsomes and won two victories, but they have failed to solve the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must necessarily pick up eight points on 12 Sunday in the simple ones to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to pick up four points, while Molinari and him, known as "Molliwood" after a failing weekend, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup's history to get four points in their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed during the four-balls, they beat the pair made up of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by a 5 and a 4 even more categorical.
Woods, who slugged during the two matches on Saturday, shined a few times, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and forsomes, and seven of them.
Justin Rose, well-rested for the morning ovens, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the forsomes, winning the 2 to 1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively numbers one and three in the world ranking.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in southwestern Paris, in a fresh but free time.
The triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for the Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4-3 in the forsomes, who lost the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point gap in simple, although Furyk's team, who held the crown, had nothing but a game to keep its trophy.
After having been second for two days, however, they might not recover from a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea states that disarmament will in no case be able to be unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions strengthened his confidence in the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in those circumstances.
At the Annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea last year had taken “significant measures of goodwill”, such as ending nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site and its commitment not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While reiterating the well-known North Korea's criticisms of Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded if it had gradually taken action, its statement was important that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made in Singapore on 12 June at the very first summit between an American President in exercise and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work towards a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea was seeking to officially put an end to the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States stated that Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused requests to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
the United States insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and increase pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposing the "end of war" declaration.
"Those who think that these sanctions can make us cry do not know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our distrust."
Ri made no comments on the second summit between Kim and Trump, which was highlighted before the United Nations by the US leader earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: "If the part concerned with the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such an impasse."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he declared before the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles to North America after President Trump's "evil" called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened the United Nations last year to “completely destroy” North Korea, did not give much praise this year to the courage with which Kim applied disarmament measures, but added that much remained to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that no time limit had been set. "It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn't matter," he said.
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared last Thursday to the United Nations Security Council that "The application of the sanctions of the Security Council must be firmly and systematically maintained until total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle the financing of Pyongyang nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
This year Pompeo has already traveled to North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced his "gangster methods".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to South Korean President Kim calls for Trump's security assurances in Singapore, and for efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take rest classes
This year, Harvard University has established a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and to fight the growing male tendency to study using caffeine all night long.
One teacher noticed that most of the students at the world's top university can't take care of them.
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of the genres in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him
At the end, a student approached me and said, "Why do you tell me that only in the last year?"
She claimed that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
First spent this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of University Health Services, stated that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that the students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, baskets, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how the lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of students instantly.
However, in our view, they have the right to know this information - in the same way as you have the right to know what the effects of smoking on health," added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride of "a white night" still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students make lack of sleep an increasing problem.
Having sufficient and good quality sleep should be "the secret weapon" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid taking weight, because the lack of sleep puts the brain in an inanition mode, making them hungry permanently.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and moved him to insist that it be offered on the whole campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to propose to all third-cycle students to follow a similar study program before joining the deemed institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide an alarm for both sleep and waking hours, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disturb their circadian rhythm and cause sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to bring down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered a new hard blow outside, Dolly Menga's attack led Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team in Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's team was hoping to record his first victory on the move since his 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team at the drift, eight points behind the Hearts, drivers of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the mid-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises in third position, just behind Hibernian on the difference of goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, the referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury following the jet of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr into the semifinal of the Betfred Cup.
Holt chose the same Livi 11 who pulled a point at the Hearts last week and would have been pleased to see that his well-trained team suffocated his opponents on every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered the possession of the ball, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored at two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle of the field let his chance pass.
Keaghan Jacobs then shot a powerful blow towards Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate defense Alan Lithgow could only reach the second pole
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have received a penalty after the free kick when Steven Lawless and collided with him, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed Colombian's requests.
The Rangers took only two shots in the first period, but Ibrox's former guard, Liam Kelly, was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and an Ovie Ejaria strike.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it by their hard work.
Again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs' stopped kicking.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold blood to choose Menga for an entirely simple end.
Gerrard responded in the middle of the day by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the wing appeared in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to make a block.
Livingston continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett shooting long bullets on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken advantage of it in the last few moments, but McGregor did well to push Jacobs back before Lithgow passed by the goal.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was taking Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Almanach "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOURNE ACCOUNT... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 Bells of Coronado film, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
One man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, it's used to look for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these listeners, the effects of atoms released into minerals by radioactivity can really be heard."
Evans: "So say, it's sure it jumps, there!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells and kill them
As part of treatment, the vaccine indicates to the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them into a laboratory.
They can then "detect" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then reinjected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them into a laboratory so that they can detect the HER2 protein common to many cancers, and finally reinject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, HER2 protein "causes an increase in several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal.
A similar approach, involving the removal of immune cells to "learn" them to target cancer cells, has proven itself in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Headed of a MAGA cap, Kanye West launched into a Pro-Trump diatribe after its passage to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was horrified on the stage after a slow performance during which he praised American President Donald Trump during a Saturday Night Live and announced that he was going to present himself for the 2020 election.
After his third song, Ghost Town, that he sang with a Make America Great Again cap, West took on the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"Many times, I talk to white people and they say, "How can you love Trump? He's racist!"
"Well, if racism worried me, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL show started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been broadcast, the recording of the West Diatribe was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock meant to mock West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind because of his hat.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with this cap on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say that I'm in a rush," he says, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, the geek?" and said he would wear his superman cape, because no one can dictate his actions to him. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
His comments attracted shelters at least twice on the part of the public and the members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, reports Variety. One person on site told the magazine: "A silence of death fell on the entire shelf."
West had been called to replace at the last minute the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West has disbanded many people by singing song I Love it in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received the support of the head of the Conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "To one of the bravest minds: TPUSA TPUSA TPUSA TPUCE Turner.
But Karen Hunter, the host of the show, tweeted that West was simply "faithful to himself, and it's absolutely wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours out a bad ideology for my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before the program, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy's tracks, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The kidnapper Snoop Dogg named Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Prince fire, which changed his name as a symbol, then the one of the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast: Indictment of attempted murder after an assault on the white gun in a restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
According to the police, the incident occurred at Ballyhackamore.
The accused should appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The heads of charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star in the Game of Thrones series, takes on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for its fine blade role, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent fantastic medieval series.
But the 31-year-old actor has taken on the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that this type of role on the screen often leads young boys to turn themselves into hard to cook to get respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit indicated that he felt "something is wrong" and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a covert of Game of Thrones, also 31 years old, admitted that he was "firmly" to address this issue.
"Personally, I think deeply that we have damaged masculinity."
"What lessons have we taught young men who become adults, in relation to the problem that now arises?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity because of its very male characters.
He continued: "What behaviour is innate, what behaviour has been taught?
What does television and street teach young boys to think they have to behave like this to be a man?
I believe that this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time - how can we change this?
There is obviously something wrong."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any prologues or follow-up when the series will end next summer, claiming to have ended with "the battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will be the star of a recovery of True West by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life now," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, in Leslie's family domain.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are concerned.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients were infected during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus spread rapidly in some parts of the country following contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was virtually reduced to zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference held in Yunnan Province.
However, from year to year, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-affected people in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70 per cent to 90 per cent of homosexual men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee has disclosed Senator-related data and denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, the American Republican Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of her team would have published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages devoted to legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat stated that these statements were supported by "extreme right" experts and websites.
"True lies, lies, and yet lies," Waters responded in a statement on Twitter.
It would appear that the information disclosed included the addresses and telephone numbers of American senators. Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown in Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, "this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information."
"This false claim is completely false and a real lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former press deputy of the White House.
"This denial is anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temperament necessary to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
It must not be provocative.
It must not question the motives of the accuser.
She must remain calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters during the mid-term elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted “the authorities and enforcement services concerned” about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English still hit. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, underdoubted spy
It has now become a tradition to search for Brexit's scope in any new British film and it seems to apply to this resumption of the Johnny English action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced the surface in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satisfying on the issue of the evidence of our insignificance represent our country's new chance of export?
In all cases, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes peeled and his face in rubber, has seen his license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English cinemaphile audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charm, has a bit of Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr Bean and a good dose of the guy who performs a small note in Les Chariots de Fire at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London.
Originally, it was also inspired by the international mystery traveler and man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached a helicopter while wearing a medieval armor and that the rotor blades briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially when "serious" licenses such as 007 and Mission impossible make up themselves in full confidence with the comedy.
The mood seems more oriented towards children than towards adults and, for me, Johnny English's busy adventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's silent movie gags in Bean's character.
The perpetually present premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A computer hacker infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great disarray of agents in service - a low-profile role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that overflows the vase for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the edge of the crisis and who already suffers from a political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to get under the tooth in the scenario.
His intelligence advisors inform him that each active spy has been compromised, he will have to get someone out of his retirement.
This means that you have to bother Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic institution as a schoolmaster, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: a few beautiful stuffs here, because English offers a spying academy like Rock Academy.
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former long-term partner, once again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who create great trouble in Her Majesty's secret services, turn to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful mortal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the influence of the technological charismatic billionaire, who said he was able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the wretched Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of light jokes: under the disguise of servers, they set fire to an exciting French restaurant; they create a chaos by flimsing on the luxurious sailboat of Volta; and English triggers a real anarchy when it tries, with a helmet of virtual reality, to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
All arrests are insured for this last sequence, but still there are good things for children in all this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't help thinking, as for other Johnny English films: can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party denies having developed a plan to allow the British to work four days but to be paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn must examine a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an additional day of leave.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while continuing to earn the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic agenda and plans to guide the country for workers.
The shift to a week of four days was approved by the union congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party stated in the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not be done in one night, but a four-day workweek is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers and with its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party was committed to a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: "A four-day workweek does not constitute a party policy and is not envisaged by the party."
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to provide details on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell agreed to take over the power of "anonymous administrators" and "profits" in utilities.
The plans of the alternate Chancellor also provide that current shareholders of the water companies may not recover the full amount of their disposal since the Labour Government may make "deductions" due to alleged deviations of conduct.
It has also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into business boards as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the private business capital to employees, which will cost up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy entrust to "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least a week following the FBI's investigation of charges against him and raised the question of whether the Bureau's findings could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, the correspondent for the 60 Minutes program, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than her South Carolina colleague.
“ Of course, ” says Kennedy.
"As I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Have you done this?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal."
However, Graham's vote seems to be engraved on the stone.
"I've made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and there's going to be an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it," Graham added, alluding to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she names couldn't verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I see nothing new that changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive star-palm and investing in an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people reaching the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only benefit from the delivery of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real objective of the festival, namely to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, the first edition of which took place in 2012, is a Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay a VIP ticket), spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, send an email to a world leader, telephone or make any other useful effort to raise public awareness of poverty.
But to what extent can Global Citizen still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people by a free concert really allow them to persuade them to demand a call for action, or is it just another example of "clichtivism" - a situation in which people really think to make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" on the part of its supporters, who advocate many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies of more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Beginning 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, including a tranche of at least $10 billion already paid or raised.
The Group believes that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who have committed themselves to "help children to develop their full potential", while promising Rwanda to help 35 million pounds Sterling to end malnutrition in that country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens messages.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the Tracey Ullman, ambassador to The Power of Nutrition at a concert held in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following over 5,000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, "what makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the major movements in the defence of civil rights and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will be performing this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will love the show.
The United States could use the Navy to create a "block" to hinder Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" appeal to the American Navy, Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of the Interior, was quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways of remedying it.
"The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the "word for energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually the same.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia, saying that it has "more than one rope in its bow" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration committed itself to boosting the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a far less expensive solution for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the "inappropriate" project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin "prisoner" of Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that the value of the North Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which is expected to double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is merely motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech in Moscow in September following a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Secretary, Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said "I believe we share this view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States attracted negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to become involved in European energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider presenting herself to the 2020 presidential elections, says the Massachusetts Senator
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-term elections.
At a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was thinking of introducing himself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top," she says, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider presenting my candidacy to the presidents."
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public assembly, saying that he "led this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Friday, in a Twitter message, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not believe that they are expected to present in 2020.
According to the survey by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe, 58% of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts claimed that the senator should not show up.
32 per cent were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other very well-known names of democrats for a potential campaign in 2020 include those of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin evokes the PTSD of Track Palin during Donald Trump's gathering
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son is experiencing at the moment, what he feels when he comes home, I can link him to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some injuries our soldiers are coming back with," she told the public at the Donald Trump gathering in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as a "taboo topic" and said about his son and other veterans that "they return a little different, hard, wondering if we respect what their comrades and members of the air force, and each other, gave the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Service, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness.
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a legal challenge to the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses asylum for victims fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 States and the district filed a memorandum in favour of an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, NBC News said.
The complainant's full name in Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy was not disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs," had assaulted her, but the American authorities decided to reject her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generated a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy cancelled a decision made in 2014 by the Board of Appeal of Immigrants, which authorized illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, stated Friday in a statement that the new policy " ignores decades of State, federal and international law."
"The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates that principle," stated Amicus Curiae in his memory.
Counsel also argued in the memory that immigration's refusal of entry policy undermines the American economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
" Asylum is granted to persons leaving their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political beliefs," said Sessions on 11 June in its announcement of the said policy.
"The asylum has never been designed to mitigate all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people face every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of double deaths in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
"I feel very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of family, by comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, in an evacuation center of the empty city.
“At every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents have been seen going to their destroyed homes, collecting precious goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were submerged.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulders, rested in front of Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to strong persistent replicas.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but after the silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The United States Ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" through "propaganda advertising"
One week after a Chinese official newspaper had a four-page advertisement featuring the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in an American newspaper, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to get involved in the US parliamentary elections on November 6, an accusation that China rejects.
By accusing Beijing of wanting to get involved in the US elections, Trump noted what US officials told Reuters to be a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures aimed at hitting state exporters such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, United States Ambassador to China and former longtime Governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an opinion paper published in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting a paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," says Branstad.
"On the other hand, at Beijing's press office, you will find few disputing voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that Chinese people can have on the disturbing Chinese economic path, as the media strictly obey the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, not to mention which newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans are alienating the electors in the approach to mid-term elections due to the Kavanaugh blockade
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in the context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the forthcoming mid-term elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely strong, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published in The Hill on September 29, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse stated "that we cannot go back."
Reeher added that he believed that the last-minute efforts made by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) in favour of an FBI investigation were enough to calm the electorate's anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and National Spokesman of the Progressive Group MoveOn, "women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not November," she said on September 28, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters sang "November is coming!" in the Senate hall, while Republicans governing the Judicial Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be disproportionate," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially in suburban electors and young voters aged 18 to 29 who, even if they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court appointed, the analysts suggested that the reaction might be alive if the Republicans were to advance the confirmation.
According to NBC News, former president of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said earlier last week that "It became a mess for the GOP."
"It's not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote, nor about the appointment of Kavanaugh. It's also about how the Republicans managed the situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, Director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps the elected Democrats in the television newspaper.
After the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, the Americans seem to be divided about the credibility of the two parties, a small majority on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov survey revealed that 41% of the people consulted believed absolutely or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates Ford's allegations and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after Senator Flake's pressure.
Ford swore an oath last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they studied in Yale in the 1980s, the candidate for the Supreme Court would have shown him his genital parts during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's free platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and those who are allowed to access such information.
In an exclusive interview given to Fast Company, Berners-Lee said in a joke that Inrupt was meant to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the launch.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "on-line personal data store" or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The particularity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this "personal responsibility through data".
According to company CEO John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers working on the project and a community of voluntary coders.
Starting this week, technological developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee has stated that his team and he is not yet in discussion with " Facebook and Google" in order to know whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely tangled in an instant.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In an article published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that the "mission [of Inrupt] is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although Inrupt has been launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a Churchman of the World War I decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England churchman to have received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and was unaware that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden in Northamptonshire last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, claimed that he was "brightly symbolic" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploit.
According to London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the violent fire of campaign guns and machine guns".
Later, he rushed on the line of shooting and, with the "greatest bravery", led the line before jumping a canon of campaign on his own and joining three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, claimed that his grandfather's actions were "a thing that I will never be, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann confided that he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will give him."
Mixed martial arts fans stayed awake all night watching Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you spent all night watching a well-filled Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event included 13 combats, including six on the main file, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, the United Kingdom viewers were side-tracked when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to have stayed awake until the early hours of the morning especially for the fight.
A supporter on Twitter described the passage to an animated drawing for children as "a kind of bad joke."
Regarding the transmission, the Chief Vice President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator, Dave Schwartz, said that "the government regulation states that at 6 a.m. this content was not appropriate, so they had to switch to children's programs."
"Peppa the Pig", yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they were going to work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
"I believe that when I think about recasting, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"However, it is six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday our time, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program went down, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you that it won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we have tried to give more for the fans and we have wasted everything.
This is a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" in sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this has inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said he didn't realize before going to high school that "everybody wasn't like me."
As part of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show by Lauren Laverne, he said he had talked about the issue of the rights of homosexuals to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The usual broadcast presenter, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of her illness.
Appeared as shipwrecked in Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt "less than" all other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls".
He said: "Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength necessary for my success."
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was "something," he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medal is now a prominent LGBT activist and took advantage of its participation this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he expressed himself because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world's triple champion claimed that he "did not expect" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old winner last year, but stated that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When we saw so many things at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of a cancer three years later - he said he confided that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had known the same heights and low.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I thought I'd win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 following a brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was whether they already had their tickets to London 2012, since he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, "Daddy, you're not gonna be there to be in the first row," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and he died so that I would finally recognize that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"That was all I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd at home during the Olympic Games, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, it inspired him his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which had accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and always gave him chicken flesh.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 a.m., BST.
A Mickelson out form on the bench of the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to stand up to avoid this being a unfortunate stage.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was dismissed by Captain Jim Furyk from the fors and forsomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the fifth-large champion shared his day between the role to support and the refinement of his game at the stand in order to remedy his ills.
He has never been the greatest driver, even at the top of his career. At 48, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes the wrong shots.
And as if the course wasn't quite frightening in itself, Mickelson, at the ninth game on Sunday, faced Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches.
If the Americans, at four down at the beginning of the 12 simple matches, start a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he could not say much.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, kicked me in the back, put his arm around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has great confidence in him.
He's a legendary champion and he's added so many things to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I was planning more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we think we should proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of meetings at the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that never fully reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven demis, although Furyk has stated that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to mock people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
“I think younger players had the pleasure of measuring themselves to him this week, which was fun to see.
He does much more than play."
European Selection Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the simple last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful path.
The Danois played his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team with the captain Seve Ballesteros counted five points ahead of the Americans, but finally stood at the top of the ranking with the smallest possible deviation on the finish line, taking it 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You don't stop remembering that we were leading widely in Valderrama; we had a big advance in Brookline, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, after observing the 2018 Classification win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and all the members of this team that it is not the end.
Go deep tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over before you have the points in the table.
We have a goal, that is to try to win this trophy, and that is where we need to stay focused.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other side - they are the best players in the world."
Grateful for the performances of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of this.
Tomorrow, it's another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it is the individual performances that will be presented and everything else goes.
It's fantastic to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're tested up to your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message to get players to do, it's to get the best of you tomorrow.
When one leaves his partner behind himself, he must go get the best of himself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players achieve better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced the two ends of these reversals of the last day, after having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing at the end of the "Medinah Miracle", where Europe took the victory.
"I remember every word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
"We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you have seen it in Brookline, as you have seen in Medina.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, weighs a lot of pressure on the games in the environment.
We've established our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we should do it, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of conducting the counter-attack and will face Rory McIllroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
"I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the entire course," Bjorn said on his selections in simple.
Germany's new warship still delayed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships dating from the cold war, but it will not be in service before at least next year due to defective systems and exponential expenditures.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the deployment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the admiral ship of all new frigates of Bade-Wurtemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems of concern that occurred after delivery have compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Bade-Württemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some furtive technologies, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent frigates for a period of up to two years outside the ports of attachment.
However, according to Die Zeit, the incessant delays mean that the avant-garde warships - which should allow Germany to project its overseas force - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the frigate cursed F125 made the big headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the ship yard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless in the event of deployment on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because Bade-Württemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the vessel is considerably overburdened, which reduces its performance and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons weighs twice as heavy as similar class ships used by Germans during World War II.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the price of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), compared to $2.2 billion initially.
The problems related to the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval force is decreasing.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Commission, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact "short of ships able to deploy".
The manager stated that the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were decommissioned but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Bade-Württemberg class were able to join the Navy.
National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research in a field of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the comments will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study of the National Trust for Scotland researchers will follow common bats and sopranos as well as brown long-ear bats and Daubenton in the garden of Inverewe, in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of the screams of bats and the activities of the different species.
A map and habitat report will be prepared to draw up a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor to the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grassland creation and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the perch and result in the loss of their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as do tumous paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct regular surveys, perchoice inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established the first and only reserve of Scottish bats on the Threave site in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
David Thompson, the domain manager, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Three, we have an ideal place for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still much to learn about bats, so that the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before the maintenance of the property is carried out, because by destroying it without the desire of a single maternity nest, it can cause the death of 400 female and small, or even the disappearance of a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to disturb them, or to destroy their perchs.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish leader of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to provide his assistance.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and in many of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations for now."
Ronaldo refutes rape charges while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges brought against him as "misinformation," and claimed that people "want to get acquainted" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to continue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Youth was accused of having raped an American named Kathryn Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He would then have paid $37,000 to keep her quiet about this incident, said Der Spiegel last Friday.
Addressing its 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram, a few hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33 years old, described this information as "misinformation".
“ No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information," said the camera the five-fold Golden Ball winner.
"They want to be a pub using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are ready to prosecute Der Spiegel about these allegations, which they have described as "inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz claimed that the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in proportion to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years."
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the hotel-casino le Palms, Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape would occur, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him that he was a "good guy" at "99%" but did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual relations, but that they were allowed.
Majorga also stated that she had visited the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a friendly settlement because she felt "feared by reprisals" and feared "to be publicly humiliated."
This 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel this regulation, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged assault, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in a contract of €100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "never regret" the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the United Kingdom would "never regret it" if it were to lose its status as world leader in car construction after Brexit.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of border delays on the eventuality of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures the vehicles Auris and Avensis of Toyota - built almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicated that it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are that car manufacturers qualify as risks to Brexit's supply chain without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated in "soft stream", parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles manufactured on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there could be disturbances at the border which, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortages of coins.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory more than a day at his Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Check Plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we must be able to maintain what has proved to be an excellent supply chain."
If Toyota was not able to specify how long production would be stopped, however, it warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and end up costing jobs.
Peter Tsovallaris, the coordinator of the United Trade Union at the factory and who has worked in Burnaton for 24 years, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never return."
A government spokesperson said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The White House announces that Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "rejected for a week", while the struggle for the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the Special Adviser responsible for investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's collaborators and Russia and the possible obstacles to the justice of the President.
The question of whether Trump will return the Deputy Attorney General or not, and therefore endanger Mueller's independence, has been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he went to the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump stated that he "would rather not" send Mr. Rosenstein back, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission to which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press deputy, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we can resist another week given all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I like to keep the press up to date."
The statement would be contested by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conferences at the White House.
Analyst Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rareness of the conferences was not due to an aversion to the "demagogic" television reporters, although she said: "I have nothing against the fact that they are missing the gallery."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without mentioning any evidence, she added that "the president participates in more questions-response sessions than any other president before him": "We checked the figures."
Press conferences will always be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to question the President of the United States directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it frequently, you have seen it well in recent weeks, and it will take the place of a press conference where you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare for press conferences to be held in solo.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and at times an odd appearance in front of the journalists assembled.
With regard to concerns about Brexit, the Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Secretary for Health wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the country and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish Parliamentarian Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of applications for status for European citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "During the summer negotiations on withdrawal continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and should lead to decisions this fall.
But the British Government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
After having suffered a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery
According to Mike Organ, from Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the Secondor of the Tigers of Tennessee, was operated urgently after a head injury on Saturday during the defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the state of Tennessee, told journalists that the injury occurred just before the middle of the day.
"He arrived on the key line and collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a civière and taking it to another exam.
A representative of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris stated that there was "not yet any information on the type or extent of the injury" and that the State of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an athlete in the second year, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five plaquages in total Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his total of the season to 18 plaquages.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp rights if they purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp rights if they buy property in the United Kingdom and the additional money will be used to help the homeless under the new Conservative regimes
This action will cancel the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million pounds Sterling a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the UK - the extra money will be used to help the homeless, theresa May will be announced today.
This action will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by undertaking to provide more affordable housing and target high-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will serve to strengthen the government's efforts in the struggle to help the homeless.
This surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp right, including the higher levels established two years ago on secondary residences and rental purchases - could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million pounds Sterling a year.
About 13% of the new London buildings are purchased by non-residents of the United Kingdom, making prices rise and preventing primers from making a place in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "phantom cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy only occurs a few weeks after Boris Johnson has required a reduction in the right of stamp to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing large construction companies to maintain the prices of real estate at a high level by seizing land without using them, he invited Ms. May to give up quotas on affordable housing in order to settle the "real estate disaster" in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of reform proposals in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the removal of "no fault" evictions.
It also wishes to give advice on broader powers to build new housing.
May said: "Last year, I said that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to the renaissance of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do so, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is as easy for individuals who do not reside in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies, to buy a house as well as for British residents who work hard.
For many too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become far away and the misery of the homeless remains too real."
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland's technician, Jack Ross, explains that his "last ambition" is to become the Scottish picker at some point.
The 42-year-old Scots are delighted to meet the challenge of re-establishing the North-East Club, which now occupies the third place of the League 1, three points from the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren into the Scottish First League last season.
“I had to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's all," Ross said at BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up following the Scottish games in Hampden with my father and it's something I've never forgotten.
This opportunity would only arise if I succeeded in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland pickers are Dick Advvocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former technician states that he did not hesitate to store behind such iconic names in such a large club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "Can I bring this club back to the First League?"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it certainly belongs to the First League," he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably not consider myself a success here unless I get the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as a assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months in Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa to rise from a third division relegation and turned St Mirren, who was on the edge of the relegation, into a great winner of the championship the following season.
Ross says he's more comfortable now than during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Alloa's support "was probably a real crossroads," he recalls.
"I really thought being a coach was better than playing.
It seems strange because I got out of it, that I made a good living, and that I took advantage of some valuable summits.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There's a lot of details to be done every week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is fine for me.
I have always wanted to lead and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I have been in my entire adult life."

The summer canicule raised the incomes of British pubs in difficulty, but increased the pressure on restaurants chains.
Figures indicate that bar and pub groups recorded an increase of 2.7% in sales in July, but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8 .
Peter Martin of the CGA Council, who compiled the data, said: "The permanent sunshine and the longer participation of England in the World Cup led to the July model of June, where the bars had an increase of 2.8%, except for restaurants, which had been further shocked.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in the catering sector in June has only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most in vogue, with more points of similarity than the lower restaurants.
Food pubs have also suffered from effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst for leisure and hospitality RSM, said: "These results follow the trend observed since late April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors with regard to out-of-home sales.
It is not surprising that catering groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decrease in sales by 4.8% on average per year is particularly painful, in addition to continuing pressure on costs.
The long and hot summer could not have been less convenient for food business operators and time will tell us whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will give a good respite."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the implementation.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for UK pubs, bars and restaurants, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and constitutes the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts that he hides from his parents
According to a survey, one out of five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - have secret social media accounts that he hides from his parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta" pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - open an account on social media that he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth of "false Insta accounts" - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported managing a "main" clean account to show their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on her 13 - year - old daughter's secret site discovered a teenager who encouraged others to "violent me."
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11-18 have a double profile, half of the students recognizing having private accounts.
CSM chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will represent athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of his vast international experience over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a great deal of respect within the Scottish, British and World Athlete community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from its participation in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I really want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre test in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympic Games where he won four gold medals and who is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after having undergone a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would seem to me to be restored or to what extent.
It was a difficult job, but I got it back completely, I learned to walk again and today I'm doing agility exercises!

Online, an advertising about milking that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising of a company proposing a milking company compares breastfeeding mothers to cows during trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is called "the first silent shot in the world", Elvie, a public technology company, launched a daring advertising inspired by a music video to show the freedom that her new shot offers to breastfeeding women.
In a cow barn full of hay, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose words are: "Yes, I treat myself, but you don't see tails" and "In case you didn't notice it, it's my breasts, not nipples."
The refrain continues: "Pump it, pump it, feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, help the women milking."
However, the advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received contradictory reactions from the public, many of which say it shed light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A poor decision than using cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are removed in the days that follow their birth," wrote one of them.

Another commented: "It's a trauma understandable to the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milkpot for mothers who keep their baby?"
Someone else added, "So off-line advertising."
Others defended advertising, for example a woman who admitted that she found the song "hilarant".
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'd have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pomper gave me the impression of being a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who take their milk (often at their place of work or toilets) and feel like cows.
It is not an advertisement that commends the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women revealed that they had danced with the discreet milks hidden in their bra-gorge.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast milk say they have the impression of being cows.
However, Elvie's breast-feed is completely silent, without wire or pipe and discreetly fits into a breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even leave while milking.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and DPE commented: "Elvie's milkshot is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By paralleling breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible feeling of freedom that this new milk will bring.
It's not the first time Elvie's milking is one of the newspapers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of children of migrants settled quietly in a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased significantly, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly due to the fact that the Trump administration's harsh speeches and policies have complicated the placement of children in respondents.
Traditionally, the majority of respondents were paperless immigrants themselves, and they feared that they would compromise their own possibility of staying in the country through the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their home should submit their fingerprints and that this data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no legal record.
"About 80% of those who are respondents or members of their families are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people," said Albence.
In order to deal more quickly with the case of children, the authorities have established new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within the month following their detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than in person, to plead their case in relation to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed to be not eligible will be expelled quickly.
The more children remain in detention, the more they are likely to become anxious or depressive in recent months, the more children remain in detention, the more they are likely to become anxious or depressed, which may result in violence or attempts to escape.
In a large establishment like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that the signs that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of its size, according to the rights defenders of the child.
They added that the movement of children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have a hard time managing.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they "would be treated accordingly".
"They must retire immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem argued that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of others have been uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "carry this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged" from both terrorist groups and from any "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom form and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who oppose President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has over 1,000 soldiers on site.
Moualem said regarding refugees, that the conditions were favourable upon their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "placing irrational concerns" that discouraged refugees from returning.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union stated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war would not be concluded.
The United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in Idlib's last rebel fortress has led to progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement provided for "specific deadlines" and expressed the hope that military measures would target the jihadists, in particular the fighters of the Nusra Front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who "will be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to "revising the current constitution articles", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, the removal and scandal led him to leave his presidency prematurely.
What would probably be "The Most Spectacular Final of a Presidency!"
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have nearly tripled, to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at large hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, which reaches 3.5 million viewers during the big evenings, is the first cable television channel.
"It's a case that attracts people because it's not something we understand," commented Neal Baer, host of the ABC's "Designed Survival" drama series, which speaks of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a celebrated comic author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? Did she ask him?
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos has a playful value.
Obviously, unlike anything on television, the scenarios in Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can meet and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most fortunate viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one finds himself watching for six hours a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used a "deep know-how" for his "Fear" book on Paul Manafort's leather jacket at $15,000 ("a clothing filled with pride" according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions that Stormy Daniels delivered from, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
For my part, I will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"If part of what he's doing seems to see a TV show, it's because he gets you to swallow something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's changing teams and daily changes in situation (to fight with the NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode if we're in the trenches.
When I contacted Mr.Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees home on the north bank of Kauai, but he was living inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand aside, not with Brett Kavanaugh who was preparing to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember the time when we encouraged all these crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr.Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside money invades the tightest elections of mid-term
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to an adjustment of the Congress's electoral districts, which allowed two holders to argue the same seat.
This recently restructured district of Pittsburgh suburb is the seat of Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who took his seat in another constituency during the special elections last spring.
Lamb is measured by another licensee, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapping the new 17th District.
The cards were redrawn when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former arrondissements were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the republicans.
The race of the new 17th district has led to a confrontation with the financing of electoral campaigns between the major branches of party funding, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCD) and the National Committee for the Republican Campaign (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory won with justice last March at a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the 20-point victory in the district.
Politologists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing Salvador for its support for China, and then withdrew
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington had little opposition to.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to convene the heads of the American diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest "their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesperson, at the beginning of the month in a communiqué.
But sanctions were only planned against Salvador, who received US assistance estimated at $140 million in 2017, including to control narcotics and provide development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, which included reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As the internal meetings continued, representatives of North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting that took place last year, seen as an advance in efforts to prevent immigrants from travelling to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now able to speak at the mid-October conference in order to demonstrate the importance of the administration at the meeting, the diplomats have made known.
And the three U.S. emissaries returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new messages or severe punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for Mr. Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the cover of anonymity.
Their statements were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying history
The next test could be the report of Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to Mr. Trump's justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his inquiry into the issue of a connivance of Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the control of Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will find himself in the obligation to report to this body, as he prepares to represent himself before the electors and, perhaps, before a jury made up of his peers.
There are many "yes," and I do not claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - or that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this fight.
In 1938 the German officers were about to organize a coup against Hitler, if only the West had led him and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these cleavages and the inevitable march of democracy is accelerating or delayed.
The Americans are currently facing a number of these cleavages.
What will we do if Mr Trump refers the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since the newspaper reported that last year, he proposed to register the president in secret and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
"What will we do if the investigation recently requested by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in mid-term elections for a Congress that will ask Mr. Trump for accounts?
If we fail to pass these trials, democracy will be a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my residence as ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light candles of the Sabbath on the table tree the swastika.
With this heritage as an inheritance, I cannot be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, trusting in the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive nil match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a solid position to qualify as Group G in the League Europe.
A knee injury deprived the field environment Graham Dorrans of his first participation from the season until the game zero 2:2 against Villarreal, but he is convinced that Rangers are able to make the best of such a result for exploits.
"It was a positive point for us, as Villarreal is a quality team," commented the 31-year-old attacker.
"We entered the game by thinking about getting something and we started with a point.
We might have been able to win it at the end, but overall, a zero game was probably a fair result.
They were probably better at the first half and we returned in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a bit of luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they made a good result in their last match, however I am sure that we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Let's hope we can go ahead now, leave the season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear of saving-retirement
Although the participants in this survey knew clearly how they wanted to be cared for, few people referred to the issue with their families.
Nearly half of those who participated in the national study said that they were talking with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent reported having spoken to their children.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't do the necessary things to have this conversation," explained Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Branch.
This is where to start.
Talk to your spouses and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your decisions on long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a repurchase value to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your heritage - provided you have the means to secure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles on the way.
Provide a health care department that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a proxy for your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Consider the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
"Is there not only the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.

A man was wounded several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
One man received several bullets fired with a compressed air gun as he walked home from an evening.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place about 2:30 a.m. BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries didn't threaten his life, and the police called witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced, and the balance should increase.
Since the communications were paralyzed, the relief services were not able to receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
A few essential facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, whose population was estimated to be 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Donggala is a regency that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) of coasts north-west of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, and especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times for a century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years have been:
2004: A major earthquake, which occurred on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that had spread across 14 countries, killing 226,000 victims on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on Nias Island, off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake reached southern Java, Indonesia's most inhabited island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and made nearly 700 victims.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of over 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake shook the resistance of Pidie Jaya to Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes have rocked the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for marital violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was interrogated for suspicions of marital violence, contravening a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, as reported by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone call from a female knowledge who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in pre-trial detention in the Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre and is held under unsecured bail of $500, said KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, it is certain" when his defense was requested, announced the network.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means that he may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of up to one year and liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of having committed a minor offence of Class B, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged assault.
The case is under way before the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed to have hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after making a link between her son's violent behaviour and the PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
earthquake in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people died following the earthquake that rocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are failing and the balance of the victims should be increased in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just off the centre of Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Video broadcasts on social media show the impact point.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami landed on the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death penalty for a person suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York apply for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged attacker in New York who has victimized eight - a rare penalty that has not been applied in New York for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, would have used a truck leased from Home Depot to attack a cyclist on the West Side Highway, in the Lower Manhattan road and a cyclist last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will be required to provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" murdered the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to apply for the death penalty filed with the Southern District of New York.
These two charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
A few weeks after this attack, a federal grand jury condemned Saipov of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, generally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a thorough preparation and premeditation," said the prosecutors, qualifying Saipov's method as "hateful, cruel and depravous".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not claimed the death penalty in prosecution for ten years.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed to engage in conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years that followed the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, has demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed the tragedy, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been moved to commit the attack after watching Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to put Daesh's flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 2 heads of charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "clearly disappointed" with the decision to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than accept his plea for guilt and condemn him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had already asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the People's Army" during a demonstration at the Conservative Conference.
The former party for the independence of the United Kingdom indicated that politicians should "feel pressure" on Eurosceptics - as one of the Members of Theresa May suggested, he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
The Conservative colleague Peter Bone stated at the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom "would have already been released" if Mr Farage had been secretary to Brexit.
But the dilemma that Mrs May is facing in order to reconcile her deeply divided troops was emphasized by the Conservatives in favour of the idea of staying in the Union which joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has a hard time maintaining his Chequers compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to leave and those who want to remain and the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between its programme and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone indicated at the meeting of the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of Chequers".
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and that he would have been charged with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd already be out," he said.
Wellingborough's deputy added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We have not engaged in world wars to submit.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone ruled out the suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people turned the page and wanted to stay is completely false."
The conservative Andrea Jenkyns, in favour of the release, was also present during the march to tell the journalists: "I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers are not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and our militants who ride the streets and have us elected first and foremost.
Leave Checkers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they honor their promises."
"Mr. Farage told the meeting that politicians should be brought to "feel pressure" if they were about to betray the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They try to deceive Brexit and we say to them today, "We will not let you out like this."
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to feel the pressure to our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the People's Army of this country that has enabled us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, pro-European fans walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists have branded Conservative banners against Brexit after the band's launch this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis mocked Conservatives because of security issues concerning the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the IT systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real farce.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider presenting himself to the presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed its future on Saturday at a public assembly in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, presents himself for the re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, GOP representative in the States, who was co-chairman in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was at the centre of speculation that Trump could face in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked whether she intended to attend the Chair.
Warren replied that the time had come "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which implies having a woman in the head of the state."
Arrest at the death by ball of Sims of the State University of Louisiana
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death by basketball basketball player Wayde Sims, a basketball player at LSU on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Service participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years, at 11 a.m. HE. Press conference.
On Friday, they published a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify a man who was on the pictures.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot dead Friday morning, near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims received a head injury and succumbed to his injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday at 247 sports.
Wayde took his friend's defense and was shot down by Simpson.
Questioned, Simpson admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and fired on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the police station of the Eastern Baton Rouge parish.
Sims, a 2 m young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 last season, and totaled 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is heading to the world title after the team's guidelines have enabled him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It soon became apparent from the moment that Valtteri Bottas became qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and flogged Hamilton on the flank as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to launch into the peloton's tailstorm, which should have been a decisive element.
Mercedes passed through the booths a later turn and found herself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-wheel action that saw Ferrari's pilot leave the inside at risk of resisting after a double defence attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated a large part of the race while maintaining his tires to target a speeding finish and advance Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived at the stands at the 44th turn, but was unable to speed up the pace in the remaining eight laps, Raikkonen clasting fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri has done a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to get a two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who pointed out that she had not unveiled Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee, but he argued that the events that took place in the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest."
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when one sees anger, when one sees people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"Seeing the disclosures and leaks, they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Do you remember his answer... did you disclose information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information," he added, thinking of the honourable senator's impression.
Feinstein received last July from Ford the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place early in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story," Feinstein told the committee, said The Hill.
"She told me to keep this confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me."
But his denial does not appear to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday evening at the gathering: "I will tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
In pursuit of his defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the wickedness, the machinery, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control," the president told Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars cleared their Friday defeat in Elite League against Belfast Giants by striking the game back 5-3 in Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants have opened the score thanks to two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home equality before Dwyer returned the advantage to the Giants.
François Bouchard equaled for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen entered two goals, ensuring their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who beat Dundee 2-1 Friday evening in Belfast, after being caught.
It was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants having triumphed during the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the advantage at the fourth minute at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the set four minutes later.
During a very busy first period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt served Cownie at 15:16, with equalization.
Dwyer secured the advance of the Giants before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team gathered and Bouchard again equalized with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, thus ensuring victory for his team by marking a fifth goal in the mid-term.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will welcome Milton Keynes at their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died by assisting hundreds of people aboard an aircraft to escape the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he dies ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many others died after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the region and a large number of people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Grand refused to leave his post in the violently shaken tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it would collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Yohannes Siriat, the spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balykpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn this," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands, the country's disaster reduction agency indicating that access to cities in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet would continue to rise because many bodies were still under the debris and a large number could not be helped," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman
Waves measuring up to six meters devastated Palu, which will celebrate a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide support and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Aircraft Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man has disappeared after the crash of a plane in the lagoon.
The airline that managed the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that a man is being carried missing, after the 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the aircraft that flowed.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not respond immediately to more specific requests for information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local ships participated in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water by trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline claimed on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses thought the plane crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others had been able to slide into the water until the aircraft's emergency exits were flowing.
He claimed that the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that the sailors who worked near the improvement of a dock had also participated in the rescue using a pneumatic boat to transport people to the farm land before the plane flowed in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned his file on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used phone calls records from a cell phone to trace the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett reported that he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that indicated that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers while he claimed to meet with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he "was lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies lies in the fact that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the SMS, calls and contact details of Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defense must begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held before the jury during the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A trio hip hop wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by imprinting its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to renew with its roots and make the hip hop political again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another Black?!
A New York New Year's Eve pursues a couple in court for firing her after a "racist" text
A New York New Year's Day pursues a couple in court for discriminatory dismissal after having received an erroneous message from the mother who complained that she was still a black woman.
The couple refuses to be racist, and it equates the prosecutions to a "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her dismay when she realized in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nouno, was black when she arrived for her first day of work.
"NOOOOOOOOOON ENCORE A NOIRE," writes Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in an SMS.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding his gaff, "in a very uncomfortable way," Plasco-Flaxman sent Mrs. Maurice, explaining to her that her former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting rather a Filipino.
Maurice was paid for a day's work, then returned to her home by a Uber.
Now, Maurice pursues the couple in court to obtain compensation for their return and claims $350 per day for the six-month home service for which she was initially hired but without a contract.
"I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do that kind of thing," she said at the Post Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment, fearing that he would not trust him after he had done something wrong.
"My wife had sent him something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco said at the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to a person with whom you were charged, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's see!"
Similaring the trial to an "extortion", Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months from having a baby and in a "very delicate situation".
"Would you pursue someone like that?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do," added the business banker.
While the case is still under way, the public opinion court has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not identify themselves to a talking bear, reveal a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It's hard to put herself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before its publication.
It's very fun, knowing what we know about Paddington's huge success."
She stated that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small teddy bear, would remain optimistic in the face of the rejection of his work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had had a "sweeter" taste after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," and adds that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was quite a calm man, and he was not a pretentious man," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that succeeds something: we're proud of him, even if it's not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, his daughter had been taken urgently to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried everything to save his life.
"Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect it to happen," said Ednan-Laperuse.
"Then, Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors had given him to maintain the heart rate were slowly draining and leaving his system.
She had been dead some time before and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on to it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, in mourning for her daughter, rode on the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had a low head, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
Women in mourning deposit postcards to prevent suicide on decks.
Two women who have lost loved ones from suicide are trying to prevent others from falling into life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys displayed, on a Welsh bridge, postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I'm forced to feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, aged 45 and staying in Lydney, said that her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room."
However, he quit his job before dying, since he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I constantly fear there is a training effect."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go to and who you can talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don’t keep quiet - you have to talk. ”
Ms. Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Ms. Davis, lost her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt down, depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
He was at his bottom on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She indicated that her death had represented enormous trauma for them, but they had to get out of it: "It's heartbreaking for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for -- a time-limited investigation, limited in its scope -- we might bring some unity," said Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "fall" in a partisan impasse.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections will take place only in five weeks, or on 6 November. If, as expected, the Republicans make a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
We still do not know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to split the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of deserters "falls" under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has decreased since the rise to power of Kim Jong-un seven years ago, declared a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of South unification, said that 1,127 desertions had taken place last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing passenger tariffs were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
The vast majority of deserters in the North will finally be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized area (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China sees deserters as clandestine migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriated women.
The relationship between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in discussions focused on the denuclearization negotiations that had so far remained outstanding.
This took place after the historic June meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in the main, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has imposed on US sanctions the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to engage in unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims that he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Pelosi, the leader of the parliamentary minority, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and declared that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments as part of an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I could not help but think that if a woman had behaved in this way, they would have treated her as "hysterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee of the Judiciary last Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with emotion, denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes nearly screamed and choked by referring to his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling it the "grotesque and co-ordinated murder" organized by disillusioned Liberals that Hilary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he's discredited himself with these statements and the way he took them to the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only unable to sit in the Supreme Court, but he's also unable to sit in the court where he's currently sitting," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Court of Appeal.
Pelosi also added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible Kavanaugh's decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh dismissed the question of the possible reversal of certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect us to say, "it's not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger overflowing, and it can't get her out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, do you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was a framer somewhere, who told me that she too cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she was angry and crying: "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I am angry."
And then she went on.
And I found it brilliant."
The tears are allowed as exudory to anger, partly because they are fundamentally incomprehension.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in an office dominated by men, where I found myself one day crying out of an inexpressible rage, was to have been seized by the skin of my neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who had always been a little terrified - who had trained me in a staircase.
"Don't let them see you cry," she said to me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and excited because they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic MP of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been caught in an extramarital affair on board a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of herself presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in high school, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Someone had called it "The Snow White and the Seven Nains."
Since the campaign was very advanced, it had been delayed in fund-raising, and therefore swore that it would not participate unless it collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave $1,000 to men were only hoping to give $250.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a rebate?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - the gratitude for the people who had supported her, the frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and the anger against sexism - that she felt confused about it.
"You would have thought that I was having a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder remembered about the press' reaction to her.
"You would have thought Kleinex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my gravestone.
"She cried"?
How trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first rescues of the US-China trade war were shocking, and although the battle was far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by charging key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest increase this week occurred with new customs duties affecting items worth US$200 billion (£150 billion), thus charging half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Each time, Beijing has returned to its natural state, striking recently customs duties from 5 to 10 per cent of US$60 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will soon waver.
Backing Washington is yielding to demands, but publicly giving in to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's President.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions conducive to economic downturn in either country is in fact much more dangerous than what observers have previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia, to the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria declares itself ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for aid to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, stated that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country which they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of that devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries sponsoring the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the US team with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 in the Gulf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the title when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team crossed the line of 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was in difficulty during most of the tournament, plunged his departure into the water in the 16th hole by-3, giving his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players ever to have reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, the first edition of which dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was dismissed 5-4 by the least well-placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, leaned 2 and 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cups Veteran, the Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the European champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
"In general, I don't cry, but today it's stronger than me.
It was a busy year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help it," he confided with emotion after the European victory.
He passed the torch to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple, last Sunday.
"I feel an incredible pride, having beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy," said Rahm, age 23.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 in career in Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the biggest golfers of all time, who picked up 14 major titles, right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The US team had a hard time finding the fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance regarding his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Chapel to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players all played very well.
We're going to join together, I'm going to work with the Americas PGA and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going ahead.
I love those guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We have to lean.
We've been outstretched."
