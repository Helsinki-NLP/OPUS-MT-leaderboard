Although the evidence points out that an experimental vaccine is capable of reducing the mortality caused by Ebola so far, no medication has clearly demonstrated its ability to treat this infection.
A cocktail of antibodies, the ZMapp, presented promising results in that field in principle, but other formal studies indicated that it had fewer benefits than expected in the prevention of mortality.
In the trial against PALM, ZMapp acted as a control, that is, scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other drugs with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee and accepts the imperative need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all athletes.

This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (an already extended theory) and also provides other data that usually fossils don't offer us, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists claim that the animal's feathers were brown on top and bottom pale or carotenoid.
The finding also offers a perspective on how the feathers evolved in birds.
As the feathers of the dinosaurs do not have a well-developed cannon, called a rickshaw, but other characteristics of the feathers (barbees and barbs), the researchers deduced that the rickshaw probably represents a later evolution than those other characteristics.
The pen structure suggests that they were not used to fly, but to regulate the temperature or how it is made. Researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a new dinosaur, the sample has adult plumage and it is not the penis of a new baby.
The researchers suggested that, although it's about the tail of a new dinosaur, the sample has adult plumage and it's not about the penis of a new brood.

The work was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the forces of tides between the dark matter of the galaxy and that of the Milky Way.
In the same way as the Moon exerts attraction over the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exercises its attraction over the galaxy of Sagittarius.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects another dark matter of the same as normal matter.
This theory claims that most dark matter around the galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo and is composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was “extremely worrying and alarming, due to its high mortality rate”.
Some patients may have contracted the disease in the hospital, in Dr. Moll's opinion, and at least two of them were health workers there.

In France, voting was traditionally an experience without just a technological presence: voters break into a booth and introduce a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate chosen inside an envelope.
Once officials check the voter's identity, it introduces the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter record.

Candidates can send representatives to testify to each and every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers perform the counting of their votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Edgar Veguilla was injured in the arm and in the complaint, while Kristoffer Schneider needed reconstructive surgery on his face.
Uka's weapon failed when he pointed to the head of a fifth man, Schneider suffered constant pain, was blinded by an eye, lost a section of his skull and had to rebuild his face with titanium.
Schneider offered his witness through a video link from a USAF base in his home country.
In addition to the Wednesday competition, Carpanedo took part in two other individual races in the championship.
His first was the slalom, where he got an "Unfinished" in his first career. 36 of the 116 competitors had the same result in that competition.
In his other competition, the giant slalom ended in 10th position in the women's group sitting with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first position of Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the 9th position of Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's sitting modality group failed to finish their careers and 45 out of the total number of 117 skiers in the giant slalom didn't qualify for the competition.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General, D. K. Arya, said: "We arrested five people who raped the woman of Swiss nationality and recovered their mobile and mobile phone".
The defendants answer the names of Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki explained that the defendants appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit her, no one was hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The path where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services released the red Audi TT driver.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital at Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya appeared before the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court accused of murdering his son.
He is detained waiting for the presentation of charges and trial, but any test of witnesses might be altered due to the extensive publication of his image.
It's a common practice in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently and according to the court's consideration, the publication of the photos was in harmful power.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University points out "journalists seem to follow a dangerous line when they publish photos, etc. of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for judicial proceedings, has told journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the prosecution is formalized.
The document, according to filtration, will refer to the border dispute, which the Palestinians demand is based on the borders prior to the War of the Six Days of 1967.
Other topics allegedly addressed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement has been signed, while PA agrees to maintain that presence only for five years.
Shooters in the supplementary plague control test would be closely monitored by guards during the monitoring of the test and the evaluation of its effectiveness.
In a collaboration between NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were hired as part of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the director of Park Conservation and Heritage for NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first safe hunting and comprehensive training.
Martelly invested yesterday at the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine people.
It's Martelly's fifth Interim Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the previous resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
Martelly responded to the generalized protests against the regime that began in October with the commission.
The protesters on violent occasions have been driven by the impossibility of holding elections, some pending since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPod errors were reported for overheating, which caused a total of six fires and caused mild burns to four people.
Japan's Minister of Economics, Trade and Industry said they had 27 accidents related to devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry announced that Apple reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as ‘non-serious’.
The Ministry responded by qualifying Apple as "truely lamentable" to postpone the report.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m., local time (21:19 p.m. Friday GMT).

Similarly, the Pacific Tsunamis Alert Center reported that no tsunami notifications were recorded.
A Filipino police officer took hostage to Hong Kong tourists when he kidnapped his bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
A large number of hostages have been rescued and at least six dead have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and old, were released in the first instance, as well as photographers from the Philippines.
Subsequently, photographers exchanged for an old woman who needed to go to the toilet, Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed his father's steps and began his medical career.
He was trained as a tocologist and started working at the Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins started studying premature births in his spare time while working in the hospital.
His research showed that if the hormone was administered, it would accelerate the ripening of the fetus' lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday the government investigators recovered the two flight recorders: the "black boxes".
The fellow fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "The Moon was the first Queen of the "Extrem", my first representative, the moon died on the night of the two moons, something extraordinary, almost like her, a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "The moon was as rare as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1400 people consulted before the 2010 federal elections, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
The Prime Minister in office Julia Gillard expressed throughout the 2010 federal election campaign that he believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Isabel II's reign.
34 % of the respondents share the view that Queen Isabel II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the survey, 29% of the respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal holder was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m free-style and in three reliefs in the Commonwealth Games, but due to the problems with its shape state is in the air.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to endure the pain because it's forbidden in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and university professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest primary number so far.
Many people checked the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, which became known on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the origin of the coming of water to Earth together with organic matter that can create proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially as Earth was formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began to exercise his position as governor this year and last month signed a bill for the legalization of same-sex marriages.
It referred to rumors as 'political chachara and lerias'.
There's a rumor that he'll be introduced to the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA ensures would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of annual fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, rather than the oldest terrestrial radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to locate an aircraft more accurately and give pilots more accurate information.
Extra transport is not being offered and underground trains will not stop at Wembley; parking and parking are dissuasive (park-and-ride) are not available on the surface.
Fears of lack of transportation opened the chance that the game would have to celebrate the closed door without the team's lockers.
A study that was published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at the University of Princeton in the U.S. and the University of Uppsala in Sweden have pointed out that the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it is thought that this process has been extended for much longer due to the breeding of a endemic Darwin pippin (geospiza strong) and a Spanish cacture pippin (geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be molded in all kinds of shapes. Gold can be rolled in small shapes.
It can be transformed into a thin thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be reduced to a minimum thickness and attached to other metals. Its thickness can be made so thin that it can sometimes be used to decorate hand painted paintings, called ‘lit manuscripts’.
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can create an indicator using the juice of a red cabbage.
The cabbage changes color depending on the degree of acidity or base (alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the pH H) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that the electrons were removed from (as hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
He mixes the two dry poles and then with his hands clean and wet, moulds them in the shape of a ball.
The dampness of the hands will react to the outer layers, which will give a strange feeling and form a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had tanks in virtually all the houses, connected to an advanced sanitation system.
In the houses of the mining cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of sewerage systems were found.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China also existed the toilets, and in Roman civilization, the toilets were sometimes part of the public bath houses, shared by men and women alike.
By calling someone thousands of miles away, they're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and immediately makes it bounce back, almost immediately.
A rocket fired the satellite into space, scientists use telescopes in space, because Earth's atmosphere deforms part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket of more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, the most important thing it has done for us is to offer us easier and faster transportation methods.
He gave us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below these, there are more medium-sized ferns that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including pets in freedom) that eat a lot more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the idea of niche, a specialized job that each cat has assigned and prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups, called bosses.
The mandaes consist of between one and three adult males who are related, along with up to thirty females and dogs.
Females tend to be related to each other, in the case of a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion Commands act in a very similar way to a fact of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (though not other great cats) in their behavior and also highly deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can gag (though not very well), swim, jump long distances and pull with force five times higher than a strong human.
The tiger is included in the same group ("genus panthera") as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who have the ability to roar.
The tiger's rusty is not as rusty as a lion's mouth, but rather a phrase with squealed words.
The ocelotes like to eat small animals, hunting monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, if they can, almost all the animals that the ocelotes hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that the ocelotes pursue and find animals to eat (fast) using the olfactory, glittering where they moved on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision and also move quietly, the ocelotes hunt their preys to mix with their surroundings and quickly jump over their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates themselves from the main population they come from (for example, if they cross a rope or a river, or if they leave to a new island so they cannot easily return), they will often be found in a different environment than they were previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it needed to be until then.
The original population has changed for nothing; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, when the new population begins to adapt to its new surroundings, it also begins to appear less and less to the rest of the population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that the same species cannot be considered.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that we can exhale (i.e. expel by breath).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We built our houses with plants and also made clothes with them, most of the food we consume is also sound, without the plants, the animals could not survive.
The mosque was the most predator of his time and was not afraid of anything except other mosaics.
His long complaint was adorned with more than 70 sharp teeth like knives, in addition to an additional game in the napkin, which meant that nothing crossing him on the road had escaped.
We can't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a bifid language. His diet included turtles, large fishes, other mosaics, and he might even have been cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-rex would not be a rival to him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a host of elements for the strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, turkey, snails and a type of rodent called leprous.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, wealthy men liked to celebrate banquets where they could recline on one side while they ate.
The luncheons of ancient Rome could not include food that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no coconut, and no ancient Roman ever tasted the turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the home of that deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
All temples have an open courtyard and then an inner shrine to which only priests can access.
Sometimes special towers in the form of a pyramid were erected, called "ziggurates", so that they could be integrated as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the lives of Hebrew families developed in the open air.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the tents were simple open displays that gave the street; the stone was used to build houses.
In the region of Canaan there were no major forests, with which the wood was very expensive.
In the Scandinavian sagas it is said that Erik the Roxo was exiled from Iceland for committing a murder and that, while traveling west, he found a territory where he named Greenland.
Despite their discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Though all countries were Scandinavian, there were many distinctions between the people, the kings, the traditions and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you saw the film The search, you probably think you drew the map of a treasure at the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not correct. While something written appears at the back of the document, this is not a treasure map.
Written at the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words appeared: "Declaration of Original Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document mouth below.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of his existence, that document in a large scroll (measures 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) has been wrapped.
So that annotation is likely to be added simply by label mode.
The landing of D-Day and the subsequent battles freed the north of France, but the south was still invaded.
It was governed by France's "Vichy." It was French that agreed peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of facing them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and French liberation forces freed the south of France and headed for the Germans.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a considerable group of people living and working cooperatively: a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin 'civilis', meaning civil, relative to the Latin 'civis', meaning citizen, and 'civitas' which means city or city state, and which also to some extent defines the size of a society.
A civilized culture means that knowledge is passed through different generations, a lasting cultural remnant and considerable dissemination.
Minor civilizations often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and cannot be recognized as civilizations of their own.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first created a weak central government (composed only by Congress) under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or legislative for the implementation of all its laws, it depended on the state authorities, who often refused to cooperate.
He didn't have the authority to invalidate fiscal legislation or tariffs between states either.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be modified, but the states took the government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian selection, along with the German, is the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Some popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, waterpolo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, hockey on wheels and Formula 1 competition.
Winter sports enjoy more popularity in the northern regions, while Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up it, Japan is often referred to from a geographical point of view as an "archipelago".
The beginnings of Taiwan go back to the 15th century when the passing European navigators registered the name of the island as a 'Formosa Island' or a beautiful island.
In 1624, Dutch East India Company established its base in southwestern Taiwan, thus initiating the transformation of the production practices of large aboriginals and giving employment to Chinese workers working on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared the country a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Japanese-Sino War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, so it gave Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, i.e. Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Ventas.
Most of the constructions on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu's restoration had already been completed, which continues until today.
For example, the most common fixed photographic image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It's still happening, but more importantly, it's the aspect ratio that inherited the formats of the digital camera image sensors.
The 35 mm format, in fact and for greater confusion, measures 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Thus, it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing between twelve to the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Different usual formats (the family of APS formats, for example) are the same or very close to this aspect ratio.
The excessively resorted and often ridiculous rule of third parties is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while keeping a little order in an image.
Sets the most effective position for the main subject to be found at the intersection of lines that divide the image into third parties vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came to the fore.
For thousands of years, Christian religion has united European states despite differences in languages and customs.
His dominant power in all areas has affected everyone, from the king to the plebeo.
One of the basic principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used for the relief of suffering and poverty, and that the monetary funds of the church exist in particular for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was Rome for a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this pier was fulfilling.
Immediately after the beginning of the hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proved to be effective by cutting down on vital civilian and military supplies, although this blockade has violated the international law of general international acceptance codified by many international agreements in the last two decades.
Britain has sown international waters with mines to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its submarine war without restrictions.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
After witness to the horror and atrocities committed during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to live in the United States of America where she took a job with Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the U.S. with 4 cents in his power, a book of poems and a letter in which Charles Batchelor (the manager at his last job) recommended to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China there was an exclusive method to show the different temporal periods; every epoch of China or every family that came to power was a particular dynasty.
Even so, among each of the dynastics, an era of instability with the division of the provinces was the time of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and Jin.
During these periods of time, there was a cruel war among different nobles who were trying to achieve the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest ages in the history of ancient China, with thousands of dead fighting to sit on the highest position in the great palace of Xi'an.
It has had many social and political consequences; for example, the use of the metric system, the passage of absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one ruler.
Even so, after the Revolution, the occupations were open to all male applicants, which enabled the most ambitious and determined to achieve success.
The same thing happens with the military, because the ranks of the army instead of based on the class, they came to be based on the caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired the beginning of its own revolutions for many other people in the oppressed working class in other countries.
Muhammad had a great interest in issues related to beyond this worldly life, and he often went to a cave that ended up being known as "Hirana" in the Mountain of "Noor" (light) to make contemplation.
That very cave, which survived over time, provides an intense image of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Located on one of Mecca's mountains, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find out at all if one knew that it existed. Within the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but the beautiful sky poured over the many mountains around, but very little of this world can see or hear from the inside of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Guiza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures that were built in honour of Pharaoh's death.
The Meseta de Guiza or "Necropole de Guiza" in the Val dos Mortos in Egypt contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while a large number of the other pyramids, tombs, and smaller temples were built in honor of the wives and relatives of Khufu.
The ‘arco-up’ mark looks like a V and the ‘arco-down’ mark looks like a staple or a square where the bottom half is missing.
Up means that you have to start at the tip and push the arc, while down means you have to start at the heel (which is where the hand holds the arc) and pull it out of the arc.
The ascending movement of the arc usually produces a smoother sound, while the descending motion is more intense and assertive.
You can write your own notations, but forget that the arch's printed marks are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Maria Antonieta, her two small children (Maria Teresa, age 11, and Louis Carlos, age four), as well as the king's sister, Madame Isabel, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a car surrounded by a crowd shouting and threatening the king and the queen.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to take the windows of the carriage open.
At one point, a mob member arranged the head of a royal guard murdered in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were obliged to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States in order to pay most of the expenses and the interest of the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the extraordinary benefits resulting from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic achievements of American imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of order.
The era in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the Middle Ages Plenary, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (d.C. from 1000 to 1300).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which by general convention ended about 1500.
Technology determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological impulse or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their demonstration in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that reaches beyond cultural or political influence and that technology has "effects" in societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that motor cars force to lead to road development.
However, a network of national roads is not economically viable for a bunch of cars, so the new production methods are designed to reduce the cost of having a car owned.
The ownership of mass vehicles also results in a higher incidence of road accidents, resulting in the invention of new health care techniques to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism contained an important element of cultural determinism, extracted from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography molded individuals and, over time, customs and culture arose related to that geographical context, which, by being in harmony with the place of that society, proved to be better than laws arbitrarily imposed.
In the same way Paris is known as the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its sound as a luxury cradle began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its category was falling during the 12th century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned bringing presents, like silk and spices that were more valued than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time when the capital title of fashion changed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its alxide moment between the X or 11th centuries and the XIV.
At first, the dress was very influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slowness of the communication channels, the Western styles could go with a delay of between 25 and 30 years.
Against the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style, one of the greatest advances of the time, the result of the crusades, was that people began using buttons to wrap their clothes on.
Subsistence agriculture is carried out to produce enough food in order to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, usually organic system that uses native preserved seeds of this correction combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, and that's still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures group individuals of similar mentality who feel ignored by the norms of society and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine the differences in a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of all these factors.
Members of a subculture often make their association manifest by a distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashion, way of acting and speaking.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to make use of the few unfortunate cases of boys who, for abandonment, misfortune or deliberate ill-treatment, were not socialized by adults when they were growing up.
These boys are called "salvaxes" or wild. Some wild boys have been confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these boys is due to parental rejection of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may experience severe child abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or fled.
Others were allegedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone away from civilization.
When they're raised by non-human animals, wild boys show behavior (within their physical limits) almost completely identical to that particular animal that took care of them, as it can be fear or indifference to humans.
Although project learning should make learning easier and more interesting, I'm going one step further.
Stadame is not a method of learning, but a help that provides support to individuals who are carrying out a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program, or starting a new project.
The states can be both virtual and real, i.e. the master or teacher is a form of stay, but it's also the male clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual stamens are internalized into the software and their purpose is to question, provoke and explain procedures that might be complicated for the student to face them alone.
Minors are welcomed by a wide range of different reasons, which can range from abandonment and ill-treatment to blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment other than enriching, emotional and educational, but it happens.
We saw the foster care system as a safe haven for that girl.
It is assumed that our foster care system without adoption provides safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable medical care.
Adoption in welcoming mode is supposed to provide all the needs that are missing in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass and interpersonal communication elements.
The particular features of the Internet led to additional dimensions regarding the focus of uses and gratifications.
For example, “learning” and “socialisation” are important motivations in the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The "personal involvement" and "continued relations" were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings resulted in fundamental discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements of milliseconds.
In particular, it is assumed that it is possible to detect when a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how people who lack the ability to understand speech as a result of brain damage suffered, however, are able to determine sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that these ability to interpret human behavior could be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
The research carried out in the 20th century showed that there are two reserves of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation and the selection deletes it from the expressed variation set.
Segregation and recombination mix the variations above and below between the two reserves in each generation.
In the savanna, it's complicated that a primate with a digestive system like that of humans can meet its amino acid requirements of existing plants.
Besides, failing to do so has serious consequences: increasing depression, malnutrition, and finally death.
The most easily accessible vegetable resources would be the proteins that exist in leaves and vegetables, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they're cooked.
On the contrary, animal feed (formers, termites, eggs) is easy to digest and provides a large amount of protein that integrates all essential amino acids.
In view of all this, it should not surprise us that our ancestors will solve their "protein problem" in a manner relatively similar to the chimpanzees in the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally awakening during the normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (between 10 and 60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively silent alarm clock that helps to get back to consciousness without fully waking up.
If you find that you end up delaying the alarm from the alarm clock without awakening, you can place it at the other end of the room, to force yourself to rise and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before you go to bed, forcing you to get up to piss.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force will be, all people have the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve a state of enlightenment, the only obstacle that stands between us and this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism was part of Buddha's learning, but these were extended through the Mahayana way of love, as well as through many techniques of Indian yoga.
Starting with, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the way to love that embraces everything.
Through Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy awakens through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga deity. Through the visualization of the different deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras react and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the clash between systems, processes and culture led to a disagreement between the countries.
After two years since the end of the war, the former allies have now become enemies and the Cold War has begun.
It would be extended over the next forty years and actually fought, through armies representing, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and other different places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retire and reorganise itself at the head of the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans remained obsolete from day to day, when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland by violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Non-aggression Pact between Russia and Poland and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for freight transport is, by contrast, the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and loading across the ocean.
The army's role was traditionally to ensure that the country maintained the ability to move people and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to move its own.
One of the most recent outstanding examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, which Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, basically using the U-boats, was trying to stop that traffic.
If the allies failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain the same way it had done in the rest of Europe.
The goats are thought to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, fur, meat and leather.
The domestic goats were usually kept in flocks that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goats who were often children or adolescents, in a way similar to the shepherds most commonly known, and these shepherding methods are still used today.
The "wagonways" were built in England in the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were merely parallel wooden boards, this allowed the horses to drag them to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads along the slightly more rudimentary roads of the time.
The crossings were introduced very soon to secure the tracks in position. However, gradually it became evident that the tracks would be much more efficient if they had an iron piece at the top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused a stronger wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels replaced iron wings. In 1767, the first entirely iron roots were introduced.
The first known method of transport was to walk; humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of the homo erectus (meaning 'man raised').
His predecessor, the australopitecus didn't walk up as usual.
Biped specialization is found in Australian fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the sahelantropus has already walked two feet ago seven million years ago.
We can start living more respectfully with the environment, we can join a defense movement in the environment, and even we can become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, it is equivalent to a treatment of the symptoms, but if we don't want a solution that is purely temporary, we should look for the root of the problems and disable them.
It turns out that the world has changed considerably as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances and problems have increased due to overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of the human being.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a manuscript manuscript was sent by Congress president John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, a couple of blocks away from John Dunlap's printing house.
That same night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the Dunlap Flight.
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon in Independence Hall's courtyard on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th, and another additional copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 known Dunlap flyers are the oldest copies that are still preserved from this document. The original manuscript document did not survive.
Different paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs have survived and still live today, called birds.
Many people don't consider them as dinosaurs when they have feathers and can fly.
These birds have many characteristics that are still very similar to those of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on the two hind legs like T-rex.
Almost all computers currently used today are derived from the manipulation of binary number encoded information.
A binary number can only be one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. Those numbers are called binary digits or bits in the computer table.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so generic that it is impossible to carry out an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of toxic medicinal products or domestic substances.
Consult the label with the first aid specific instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term worm with a formal meaning for this group of insects.
This term has its origin in the classic familiarity with chinches, insects with a great ability to adapt to parasitic humans.
Both the redundancies and the chinches are nesting, they are adapted to live in their own nest or in their host.
In the United States of America there are approximately 400,00 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which converts it to neurological disease with the greatest incidence among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to suffer multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that it doesn't interest them or the child, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to draw a plan for their baby adoption.
In an adoption, natural progenitors renounce their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child or the child.
The main objective of science is to determine the functioning of the world by means of scientific methods -- this method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
It's not only through experimentation, but the experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and observations that guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinion was accepted on all science issues, including psychology.
As the wisdom of the Greeks declined, the West drifted away from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often have a vital dependence on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
There are documented periodic rhythms, which are no more than responses to external periodic patterns, in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free operation even in the absence of external patterns.
The experiment carried out by Hershey and Chase was one of the leaders of the suggestion that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments where they either marked DNA in the bacteriophagus with a radioactive phosphorus or their protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have multiple different effects depending on their class, the relevance of the element of the compromised genetic material, and whether the influenced cells are germ-lined.
Only mutations in germ-line cells are susceptible to transmission to children, while mutations in other areas can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-centered tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural spaces to enjoy the landscape, as well as the fauna and flora.
Examples of ‘in situ’ activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits, in addition to the study of ecosystem information.
For example, visit, photograph and learn about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural villages by car to go to their place of work crossing with other workers whose destination is the same place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport launcher service, everyone is in some way connected and supports the private vehicle-based transport system.
Today's science shows that this massive coal-dependent economy has changed the biosphere of one of its stable states that sustains human evolution over the last two million years.
We all participate in society and use means of transport, almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, a similar level of complaints about water quality or falling bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints? Why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetence? Or are there any other more elementary problems?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and private vehicles from one point to another and the interactions that maintain each other.
Unfortunately, studying the traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict the behavior of drivers with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within reasonably consistent margins; therefore, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and an approximate mathematical representation can be made.
To achieve a better representation of the traffic flow, relationships have been established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan and design traffic services operations.
The insects were the first to fly. Their ability to fly helped us escape the enemies more easily and find food and mate in a more effective way.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to stack their wings against the body.
This offers you a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
At present, the only insects that can't bend the wings are the devil's horses and the ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others felt otherwise; the Solar System was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds logical, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and most caudal river on Earth. It takes 8 times as much water as the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river on Earth, six miles long.
About 20 percent of the total water from the rivers of the planet that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazonas is 6,387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids were still built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they were never overcome by Guiza's, either in the size or in the technical superiority of its construction.
The old Egyptians of the new reign were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City population is about 800 people. It's the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest number of inhabitants.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its official laws and communications.
Italian is also the common language used by most people working in the state, while in religious ceremonies Latin is often used.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Mankind knows the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper from antiquity, because they can be found in nature in its original form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized about the principle that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but also the theory that they are transformed into new substances that shape what we see.
Alloys are basically a mix of two or more materials. Do not forget that the periodic table includes many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium were considered metals, of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as coal.
Everything in the Universe is composed of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillion of them may fit at the point at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil became a good friend to a lot of people at the time of their invention.
Unfortunately, when new writing methods arose, the pencil was relegated to a condition and lower uses.
Now people write messages on their computer screens without ever having to approach an afilapis.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something new replaces it.
The fission pump works on the basis of the beginning that energy is required to bind a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Seems to drag a heavy car to the top. Once the core is re-divided, then it releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, that is, they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The Moon's surface is composed of rocks and dust. The moon's outer layer is called a cork.
The cork has a thickness of approximately 70 km in the nearest area and 100 km in the farthest.
It's thinner under the Marian and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the nearest side, because the cork is thinner, and the lava will make it easier to climb to the surface.
The theories about content focus on investigating what motivates people or what makes them attractive.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that were internalized when they matured and became adults.
These theories study that makes certain people want certain things and that things around them will lead them to perform certain actions or not.
Two popular theories about content are Maslow's Theory of Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Theory of Both Factors.
In general terms, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to lead their former companions. At one end they will try to continue to be "one more companion" (or companion).
This type of manager has the difficulty of making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and demanding responsibilities of people.
On the other side of the coin, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who believes that it must change everything the team has done and adopts as its own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often creates divisions between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams respond to the same levels of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as the contact point of their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than conventional team members, because their teams can meet depending on the different time zones, which the national management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible equipment" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) also constitutes an exclusive component of virtual equipment.
The "invisible team" is the management group to which each member responds. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the slow process of establishing an organization that promotes learning? One of the goals of putting the learning concepts of an organization into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can sweat.
As a result, the process of an organization that works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new process of innovation that meets the needs of the client.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, in addition to sharing knowledge and learning as an organization.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research, thus reducing the research area and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientific research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The extension of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This offers a great deal of information and material that allows us to build simulation models to help us understand the process in our mind.
Although AI has strong nuances of science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research is looking for machines to automate activities that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to answer patients' diagnoses and questions, in addition to acknowledgement of writing, voice and face.
These kinds of things have become independent disciplines, which try to provide solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now used frequently in the areas of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it has been integrated into multiple domestic software applications and video games.
The excursions are a very important part of any class, and the teachers would often love to take their students to places where they can travel by bus is not viable.
Technology offers the solution through virtual school visits, students can see museum devices, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art sitting in their desks.
Virtually sharing a school tour can also be a great way to reflect on the excursion and experiences shared with other classes in the future.
For example, every year Bennett School students in North Carolina design a website about their excursion to the state capital; every year the website is remodeled, but previous versions are saved online to act as a cutting album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often begin their experiences with blogs by showing a poor domain of grammar and spelling, the public's presence usually causes them to change.
As students often become the most critical audience, the blog editor begins to strive to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, keeping a blog "obligates students to learn more about the world around them" The need to feed the interests of the public inspires students to show their intelligence and to be interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
A proper use of blogs "allows students to be empowered to have more analytical and critical spirit; by offering an active response to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of writing by other people, in addition to defining their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's lovely bilingual capital with a selection of art galleries and museums where you can contemplate the country's past and present.
Further south are Niagara's ferves and the north is home to the intact natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and many more, they make Ontario an example of what foreigners consider intrinsically Canadian.
Large areas against the north are hardly populated and many are virtually uninhabited wild areas.
Here's a comparison of populations that surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean on the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is, by contrast, the largest and largest continent of its own in its flora and fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and famous for being luxury vacation centers on the beach.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region that settled deep in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region limits the Sahel and, in the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women are advised to travel here to claim to be married regardless of their marital status.
It may also be useful to wear a wedding ring (which does not seem too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences could derive from something they would consider harassment and it's customary to pursue them, hold them from their arms, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to assert your position (whether by cultural differences or not, it's not acceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sailors in the tenth century B.C. and used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the White House, to finally abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city with the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders, who established trade bases there, put Casablanca.
Casabranca is one of the least interesting places to shop all over Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as taxis, ceramics, leather articles, "hookahs" and a wide range of bagatelas, but all of this addressed to tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the east side, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and most of the streets of the city, particularly the center, were buried.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any outside of town visits should be investigated to know the state of the confrontation that still persists in the northern Kivu province.
Even so, the city is the base from which you can ascend to the Nyiragongo volcano, in addition to some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
To travel through Goma, wedding (mototaxi) can be used. The normal (local) price is approximately 500 Congolese francs for that short offset.
Together with its relative inaccessibility, the term Timbuktú in English has become a metaphor of exotic and distant islands.
At present, Timbuktou is a very poor city, but his reputation makes it a tourist attraction and also has the airport.
In 1990, he joined the list of heritage sites of mankind at risk, for the threat of the desert area.
It was one of the main stops in the PBS special for Henry Louis Gates on the Wonders of the African World.
The city offers a hard contrast to the rest of the country, for its more Arabic than African air.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northwest South Africa and crosses the border with Mozambique to the east, Cimbabue to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each keeping different fauna and flora.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered to be the flag of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in other South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees.
It's likely also beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which offers access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South Africa National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the whole territory and it's the place that many tourists consider most relevant.
The parade of buildings that define the horizon in Hong Kong has been compared to a brilliant bar chart that is made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victorian port.
To get the best panoramic views of Hong Kong, you'll have to get off the island and head for Kowloon dock on the opposite side.
The vast majority of the urban promotion of Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on land earned at sea on the north coast.
British colonists have taken this place as their own, so if we're looking for samples of colonial history in the territory, this is a good starting point.
Sundarbans is the largest strip of mangroves on the planet, which stretches 50 km (50 miles) inland from Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
Forests are not mere mangrove swamps -- they include some of the last few of the imposing jungles that have in the past covered the giant plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, of which approximately a third is covered by water and marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wild life and it has been estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 carats in that area.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (crossing the river) uninterruptedly throughout the day, but most particularly those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As buses between districts usually go full, it is recommended to buy the ticket in advance.
Most districts have the service of small Japanese Coaster buses, comfortable and solid vehicles.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge of the Oyapock River is alluring. It crosses the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in the French Güiana.
Both towers reach a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 m wide.
Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it didn't open for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The Guarani was the most important indigenous group that lived in what is now known as East Paraguay; they lived as seminomous hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The region of Chaco was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the guaycurú and Payguá, who survived by hunting, collecting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "the giant province of the Indians", was born as a result of the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The period of colonization initiated by the Spaniards lasted three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely maintained its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and chicken players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year is celebrated in December in the chicken fields in Las Cañitas.
Here you can also witness tournaments and smaller matches for other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for pole matches, you can consult the Argentine Association of Polo.
The official currency of the Malvinas is the pound of the Malvinas (FKP), whose value is fixed in equivalence with the pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged on the only bank on the islands, which is in Stanley in front of the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is generally accepted on all the islands and on Stanley himself, credit cards and U.S. dollars are also allowed.
On the islands of the periphery, credit cards are probably not accepted, although British and American currencies will be accepted; we must consult the owners in advance to determine what is the most acceptable method of payment.
It is virtually impossible to exchange the currency of the Falklands outside the islands, so it is advisable to make the change before leaving.
When Montevideo is found south of the equator, it's summer when it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical; in the summer months temperatures above +30 °C are usual.
Winter can be disappointingly cool: temperatures are rarely below zero, but the wind and humidity are combined by a colder feeling than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: rain remains almost invariable throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to the presence of humans, they are treated in any case of wild fauna that should not be fed or harassed.
The park's management recommends keeping at least 100 metres away from the bears and wolves and 25 metres from the other wild animals.
It doesn't matter what dociles they might look like: the bison, the wings, the bears and virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries because they do not maintain a proper distance, these animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so they must be left space.
Besides, it should be taken into account that the smells attract the bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid carrying or cooking foods that smell and keep the camping place clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, the city lies on the island of Upolu and has a population of only 40,000.
Apia founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the place where the infamous naval confrontation took place in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to abandon it.
They sank all the ships except a British cruiser, lost about 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence driven by the Mau movement, a peaceful demonstration in the city ended with the murder of Supreme Chief Tupua Tamase Lealofi III.
Due to the fact that Auckland is located between two ports, it has many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are in the Pacific Ocean and range from Long Bay to North to Devonport in the south.
They're all safe sand beaches for swimming and most of them have the shade provided by the Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitetata Bay, in the elegant residential neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
They tend to be very crowded family beaches with a good variety of tents along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The most famous local beer is "Number One"; it's not a complex beer, but it's nice and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta".
There are many types of French wine to choose from, but probably New Zealanders and Australians better support travel.
The water of the local fetch can be safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find in case of doubt.
For Australians, the idea of a coffee "with milk" is alien. A coffee is only an "espresso", the capuchin carries a layer of mounted cream (no foam) and tea is served without milk.
Chocolate in the bowl meets Belgian expectations. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Throughout the year, many trips to the reef are organized, and the injuries caused by these reasons in the reefs are unusual.
However, the advice of the authorities must be followed, the indications of the signs must be complied with and special attention should be paid to the safety warnings.
The cubemedusas are located near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers between the months of October to April to the north of 1770.
The sharks exist; however, they rarely attack humans; most sharks fear humans and will escape by swimming.
The saltwater crocodiles don't live actively in the ocean; their primary habitat lies in the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance offers tranquility to the traveler knowing that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents usually have offers with specific hotels, although it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campings, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, means of transport from or to the airport or even combined plane and hotel packages.
You can also save the reservation if you need time to rate the offer or search for other documents for the destination (for example visas).
However, any change or request must be handled in the first instance through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, most of the attendees decided to camp within the festival itself, and most of them considered it a fundamental part of the experience.
In order to be closer to the action, it will be necessary to arrive early to get a camp near the music.
It should not be forgotten that even if the music was finished on the main stage, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music until early in the morning.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young girls.
If you cross the North Baltic during the winter, you have to check the location of the cabin, since the crossing through the ice generates an extremely unpleasant noise that affects some people more.
St. Petersburg's cruisers once included in the city. Passengers on the cruise are exempt from having a visa (conditions are met).
Usually, casinos work to a large extent to maximize the time and money that guests spend on. There are usually no windows or clocks and the exits are hard to find.
They often have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to have a good mood for the guests and who remain in the facilities.
In some places alcoholic beverages are offered free of charge. However, drunkenness overshadows judgment and all good players are aware of the importance of remaining sober.
People who are going to drive to high latitudes or mountain passes should consider meeting with snow, ice, or temperatures below zero.
On frozen or snowy roads, friction is low, so you can't drive in the same way as you would in the normal asphalt.
During a strip in a very short space of time it may fall snow enough to get trapped.
The visibility can also be reduced by snow or frost or by condensation or ice in the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries and traffic is kept without virtually interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most attractive for tourism in Africa and the most prominent for many visitors.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to surface travels to see the impressive African fauna, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, as they can be elephants and giraffes, are very close to cars, so a normal equipment will allow you to get a good vision.
The lions, the Guepards and the leopards on occasions are shy, with which the best way to see them will be with prisms.
A foot safari (also known as "passage through the mountain", "safari for hiking" or "footing") consists of hiking, for a few hours or several days.
Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, some of the events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to celebrate two Summer Olympics, after hosting the games in 1964.
If flights and accommodation were reserved for 2020 prior to the notice of postponement, the situation may become more complicated.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March most cancellations by coronavirus will not go beyond July 2020, the scheduled Olympics date.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between 2500 and 130 000, around the cost of an average input of 7000.
Passing iron to damp clothing can help to dry it, many hotels have a passing iron and table available for use, even if they are not in their own room.

Stirbites are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on each side of the saddle.
They offer more stability for the rider, but they can present security problems because of the possibility that the rider's feet will get trapped in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and gets his foot stuck in the scaffolding, he could be dragged by the horse if he runs away. To minimize this risk, there are a number of safety precautions that can be adopted.

Return currents are the flow that returns from waves after breaking against the beach, generally against a reef or similar.
Due to the topology of groundwater, the flow of return is concentrated in a few deeper sections and it is possible that a rapid current is formed towards the deep waters from that point.
Most deaths are caused by the fatigue of trying to swim back countercurrent, which may be impossible.
As soon as it gets out of the stream, swimming again doesn't make it any harder than usual.
You should try again in an area where there's no chance of getting trapped or, depending on the ability to swim and if you've already been sighted, waiting to be rescued.
The shock of return is produced before the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more serious.
