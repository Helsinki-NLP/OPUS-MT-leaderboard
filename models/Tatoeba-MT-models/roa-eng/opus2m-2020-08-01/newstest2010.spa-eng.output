Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president of history.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and check will be received, inter alia, by the exceptional effort in strengthening global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have a lot to do.
First, the visit of the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with the five members of the committee who, in October, elected him from 172 to 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple planned a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate in a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
It will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, even though the third one to receive it in his charge.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the prize, it will speak of the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of its critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and the check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to provide them with charity, but it has not yet decided on which organization in particular.
During his or her full programme, the President and his or her wife will attend a banquet to which, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and another 250 guests will attend.
Obama had from the beginning an attitude rather reserved for the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not just for him, but for all who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of nature accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police accused the president of the civic association Společnost ochránc a.k.a. Litoměřice (Sociedad de ombudsmen de la nature Litoměřice).
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals demanded the investors money for their own benefit, said the spokesman of the Litoměřice Alena Romová police.
The president of the Litoměřice Nature Defender Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently under arrest and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like containers too much to separate the garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate packaging from beverages and in the southern villages of Moravia can find containers to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
It takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that Brno doesn't separate the garbage at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough for this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of garbage, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all by the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a bottle of PET in the center to the right container?
It's almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in the square Moravské náměsti, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Don't be angry with me, Mr Onderka and his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
There is no need to mention that elsewhere it is not easy to separate garbage.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
Per vagancy
What happens is the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered, after a party, to throw several bottles of glass and plastic into the trash.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, on my way to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing from the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extraliga, which shames us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the Jihomoravský Kraj region.
The budget of "Paroubek" took money from the income and sickness benefits
After the left, in spite of the government's opinion, add funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, sickness benefits or construction savings.
But not for the interests of state debt or international disputes.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of the coming year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for some groups, they trusted that the government would later apply for a loan for sensitive expenses, income or sickness benefits. "That is only to postpone the problems for the future, it is to place mines," Janota says.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest, and some day, you have to return the money.
The State does not have many options to make money.
If the State does not reduce social subsidies or operating costs, taxes must be increased.
To all who added the left now: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later, also his children.
People don't have to worry about rents or sickness benefits, they'll get them. Of these accounts, 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; next year will not be missing in the treasure only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase alongside the cost of interest.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer come up with a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity allowances, as the government did in its package against the deficit.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, the coming year will also be worth five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, sectors where the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The best you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty major constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mostly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the dividend value is never safe or a bottomless bag.
Last year ČEZ spent 18 billion on the budget.
Every year dividends are liquidated ecological damage, serve to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Almost three billion were obtained from the budget to grant several compensation to victims of communism and crime, or for litigation costs, including in the construction savings.
It is not clear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we may have to pay for it, Janota says.
Afterwards, the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, to take over the government budget reserve.
There are also a hundred million missing for the Státní pokladna project (State Fund), the price of which is two billion and which has already been launched. It must allow you to monitor online what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the Minister of Finance does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone can work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone where the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
With just pressing one key, they pass in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the US company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at a time.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti from the VMware company indicated in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November of last year and several days ago it was first demonstrated.
It will be launched in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the systems mentioned work, Windows Mobile and Android, at the same time.
The development of the new mobile phone technology is at its peak.
The VMware company cooperates with European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only do teleskiers in Krkonoše worry about snowless tracks.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Nochebuena and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at offers, check prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether these Christmases will be snow or mud," mentioned the maintainer of the Spindl news portal.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend a Christmas Eve at Špindlerýv Mlýn according to their expectations, should no longer hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers at Špindlerän Mlýn mainly offer weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will yield and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, Jandura said.
Ingotours, a travel agency from Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us the most is Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered remain free.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays," mentioned the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlabí's travel agency can still offer Christmas in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
Also very well sold the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
Nobody wants to spend the year on the snowless mountain.
If the tracks stay snowy during the week, Christmas dates will also run out," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas, we have the last free seats.
Interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February is also sold well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of Nochevieja stays are already busy at the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, at Janské Lázně's most recent hotel in Christmas half the beds are still free.
This January was a great surprise to us, as we find about sixty percent of the capacity to occupy.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, the interest for the stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, mentioned Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
At the moment, however, it seems that the hoteliers of Krkonoše will be given the desire for snow waiting.
Thursday should fall temperatures and, if there are precipitations, in the mountains should snow.
But then the temperatures will rise again, Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Kralové, of the Hydrometheorological Institute of the Czech Republic, reported.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the most foolish.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, eagerly awaited, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is the word "equal to Iraq" used several times, but it did not hesitate to use the title of the January 2007 Bush declaration for its own statement: "A new way forward."
It was himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from civil war, and that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on recommendations from field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that nothing is talked about today about Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however objectively left his successor a much more favorable initial situation than he could expect.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
The camp captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the general Afghan operation Stanley McCristal. He, even in spite of the traditional subordinate relations, submitted to the undecided gunmen in the White House a harsh criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to be able to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he cheated the general over 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him a further 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic thing about Obama's entire strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing Afghanistan's troops in 18 months, and to finish this procedure in three years. All Obama's doctrine generated more questions from the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the increase bears the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin. After him, patriarchal tribal relations will remain.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated because of confused relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum goal of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is shocking at his volunteerism.
For the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that the military sent to the war to "come home soon," will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of the US defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians don't know, and they don't want to explain to their constituents, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with Hindu Kush.
The other factor, which can radically affect the situation, is the development of developments in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and increased sanctions have no effect on Iranians, the United States will have to make a difficult decision: to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for answers precisely when, according to Obama, America initiates the triumphal withdrawal of Afghanistan's troops.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is that it is three years away for the presidential elections and so there is still a lot of time left to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will not receive cash bonuses again
The top executives of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior management shall receive, instead of money, shares that may not be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to combine the bonuses on Wall Street with the long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longer path it must take, mentioned the former investor bank of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced the critique after having split almost $17 billion (almost CZK 300,000 million) for bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters agency, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, the $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to record only once, with a tax of about 50 percent, bank bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds (approximately 752,000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year the women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories less Physical
Five women, which is a record figure, received today in Stockholm from the hands of King Charles XVI Gustavo of Sweden the Nobel Prizes this year, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, appeared among the award winners.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his fellow countryman Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was received by Israeli Ada Jonath and American Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize given, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by American Elinor Ostrom and his fellow countryman Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a prized woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awardee picked up the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to 10 million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
In the event of several awards in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The most traditionally expected Nobel Peace, was received today afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of having been awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country participating in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are essential for achieving peace, even if its price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning to the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who is setting up his stay in the government, as he disagrees with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approved Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is supposed that the budget, and perhaps also Janota's stay in the cabinet, will be the topics of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
The spokesperson for President Radim Ochvat reported on the quote.
On his stay in office, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the Budget Act, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the left-wing proposals for transfers of funds and increased the money for salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government disagrees with the proposals of the Social Democrats, because they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left side and the government, Klaus and the right side, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Because of this conflict, future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Greens Party, are becoming controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, effectively liquidates the package of savings measures imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the State Budget Act; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long been ignoring "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus between political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is frightening and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and Greens evidently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences."
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday ČSSD said that approval of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
The people were also happy.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the leading roles are played by American actors.
History speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the American actor who won an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that 91-year-old Mandela asked him to interpret it in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon has another important role to play.
I said, "When I interpret it, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama on the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up being a slave, of the fictional president of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to join rugby players, who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
The South African team was able to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to get Mandela's story to the cinemas.
He had no other goal to play this role in such a way that it was as much like the reality as possible, said Freeman.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were out of the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I discovered that when I held her hand, I received her energy, it was transmitted and she had the feeling of knowing how you feel, she said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A great surprise to him was, when he finally met with Pienaar for the first time in his home.
I remember calling at the door, he opened and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was: "In the film I look much higher."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of Director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and there is also talk of ambitions for the Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very good film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomates.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The Secret of Splendor on Solved Norway: Russians Tested a Missile · Global Voices
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia concluded by acknowledging yesterday that close to the borders with Norway tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The "Bulava" missile, formerly intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly out or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write "Bulava" as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there were no problems at first.
At the end of the flight there were new technical problems in the aircraft.
The engine probably crashed at the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the Dmitry Donskoy nuclear submarine, which floated in the White Sea.
This type of missile enables the launch from a vessel that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulava".
The same Norwegians from the first moment did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by claiming that we cannot just talk about a failure.
The first two phases of the missile endured and the crash occurred in the third.
In previous cases the engines were detected immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went through completely without mistakes, only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful, according to the Ministry of Defence.
The success of nearly 50 percent of the generals are optimistic, and that is why they continue to claim that "Bulava" will one day fly smoothly and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, the maximum total weight of which is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed at 51 years of age an annual contract with Moscow's CSKA
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will re-present himself at 51 years of age at a professional hockey meeting.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play on Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his career at the age of 40 in 1998 and currently presides over CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash is injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov constantly practices and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach at the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single party.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to ice tracks, he will become the longest professional player in Russian hockey.
The legendary front player Gordie Howe played in the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the entire season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makanov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, won in the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had successes at the NHL: playing with Detroit won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Chamber of the Glory of Hockey.
Hyundai met union requirements. Will cancel all additional work
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent supplementary work, the unions declared the emergency on Monday by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai automobile factory.
The management, however, wants this year to agree with the unions one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary additional work for Saturday, December 19, that is to say, it will work in two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to the server Sedmička.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or take a day off on December 28, that is to say, extend the Christmas parties in one day, Vaněk mentioned.
In addition, all employees on Saturday's shifts will receive money for the trip and for the meal.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon decided immediately to cancel all the supplementary work for December, Vaněk mentioned.
The employees of the automobile factory were forced to work two hours more than eight hour shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the management of the factory and trade unionists must take place on Monday morning.
The head of the Petr Kuchař trade unions said on Wednesday, that if they pledge to meet the requirements and sign the document, they are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for the frequent supplementary work.
They also protested against the poor conditions of payment and the alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work extra hours to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their statement of the Monday strike emergency also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted the manufacture, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, trade unions require the company to reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The serial manufacture was started last November.
Until last September it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech Discovery: An Effective Substance Even in the 'HIV Viruses'
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds capable of moderate the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of this improved substance is that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some medicines already accessible.
The AIDS disease cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients may be significantly extended by a mixture of medicines that prevent replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, the so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs no longer work.
The work of the experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and Heidelberg University shows the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that the substances called metalocarbons have an effect on the albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are made up of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently from all medicines used today, and that is why they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
Metalocarbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedra cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are united by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A Traitor and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and it is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the protease of HIV, the fractionation of the HIV virus does not occur and no mature, infectious bodies of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, explain scientists in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are united by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this set of HIV protease substances was carried out in test, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metalcarbons on the common enzyme variant is not as strong as on clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes, metal carbon dioxides are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlína, the head of the structural biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for the coming year is "scarrying" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should think about his future existence.
The ODS statements were noted by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say they leave time for the analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party evidently no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to rely on the minority, who is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of public deficit is completely different, warned Nečas.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the 2010 budget, however, with the amendments proposed by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for state officials' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached the SDG proposals, as the budget deficit is increasing overcrowded.
The Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
ODS before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the Government's wish, that the modified budget is better than an interim budget.
Disillusionment and futility
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of disappointment and feelings of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will re-evaluate the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of approval of the amending proposals, the situation might have been different.
According to Česka TV Janota requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He pointed out, he's thinking about staying in the function.
The reason is their disappointment at the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government they have nothing to do with those nominated by ČSSD, who imposed changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also state clearly, if he resigns, whether the chamber adopts other laws that increase the deficit, such as subsidies in sickness, income, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not to blame
It's the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in lieutenant positions there were people belonging to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to redeploy the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is supported by the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, it will not be able to rely on the support and tolerance of the members of ODS.
I have not thought about it, when it is time, I will deal with it, told the journalists in the Chamber of Deputies the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by the members of ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer went to a European Council meeting in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS gave in to the Prime Minister's request
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would probably vote against the modified budget if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask ODS Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, we reacted to the question, if ODS does not care about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
In resigning from the term of office, I knew that in the following months it was mainly about reversing the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of all the positive things, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new ČD train schedule, less trains will circulate at almost the same rates
Česke Dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less-used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total extension of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will win, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostravavsko region, dráhy for this line will add a pendulum road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will no longer circulate to Bratislava.
On the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will circulate less fast trains, will be restricted direct links Prague - Letohrad.
In the regions, the largest reduction in Drahy-planned transport is in the Hradec Kralové region, 8 percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding areas.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice trail and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15 line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at Prague station Hlavní nádraží.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From December 13th, travellers will not travel back to Bratislava in Pendolino.
This year's regional railway account: 200 million more than before
The rapid trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive the coming year four billion crowns in total, as this year. Local trains are charged by the regions, the coming year will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains Drahy have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one year old.
Drahy is happy with the system, and perhaps that's why they didn't increase the prices of a large majority of tickets.
Changes will take place only on one-day tickets - ČD Net and on the cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without customer card the price ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the single price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippine armed forces continue to hold more than 50 persons, children were released
The armed have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several pupils from a primary school and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 kidnappers.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say approximately 19 armed uses hostages as a living shield on the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree to the surrender of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the armed members belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency the police previously chased the kidnappers because of violence, whose cause was the adjustment of the accounts between two clans of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre, related to the governor's elections, were 30 journalists.
Because of the suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province was arrested in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampathuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty.
On Mindanao Island Muslim separatists also operate.
However, on Tuesday they renewed the peace dialogues with the Philippine government.
The story of RSA refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official Czech title esInvictus: Neporažený) is released in the American cinemas, which captures part of the biography of the former President of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-known apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the leading role.
The second role, that of the legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was interpreted by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born of the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when preparations for the world football championship are completed in the Republic of South Africa. At the same time, the media are shocked by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the leading roles by the "little interesting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's proud of the new movie.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared me well to play it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to, as it is said, charge his energy, mentioned in an interview after the premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the movie we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book of the British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. He portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first electoral presidential period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as protagonist also puts on the suit of the national South African rugby team and enters the playing field. RSA won the world cup at that time.
By entering the grass into the suit, which is considered almost sacred in RSA, Mandela 14 years ago won great ovations, especially of the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship will perhaps help people join and form a nation, mentioned rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
You'll still see if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as he said in a recent interview with LN, a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire caught in the morning a transformer of the Čeps company in a switch box near the village Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukaš Marvan, the spokesman for firemen in the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firemen wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, but later they changed their mind and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injured, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's spokesman, the failure did not endanger the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity nothing similar happened, this type of damage is sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the ČEZ company's voice for the North Czech Republic, electricity supply was not cut, and the fire of the electrical substation did not affect the functioning of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. Čeps pęsobí in the territory of the Czech Republic as sole maintainer of the distribution system, of the electric driving of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It preserves in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical power of the transmission system to the distribution system, and also maintains the electric driving of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura will file a complaint for slander to three ČSSD Hemmans
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will present a complaint for slander to three Social Democratic Hemans.
This is Michal Hašek from Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek from Pardubický kraj and the Heman of Olomucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in twenty minutes at Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the effort of the company to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with Česke Drahy.
All three Germans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the pastel passes", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say that we are more expensive than Česke Drahy, which is not true. We know the prices of Česke Drahy, which were fixed last week.
So there's nothing left for us to defend.
It is for slander towards the Student Agency, he said for Radiožurnál Jančura.
He also mentioned having the evidence of all regions, and he said that they had not taken the necessary measures in line with European law.
It is therefore preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region, and I appeal to the other Germans to do so too.
I suppose, which will also be clearly demonstrated on this occasion, that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses false and lying arguments, Hašek mentioned.
Jančura announced last week that he would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose objective would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radiožurnál told him that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue after the New Year.
He said, that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with Česke Drahy to maintain regional railway links and for the charge of approximately 150 billion crowns did not convene a tender.
According to Jančura similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a Member of ČSSD, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't leave it, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a Member of ČSSD, I know, which gentleman it is, I will not say his name, Jančura said today for Radiožurnal.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine starting in January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine it must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against pneumococcus culminate.
The Medicines Institute is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have already made this clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January onwards, children born from 2 August last year can receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or before have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of child age.
Last year, a fourth of the families voluntarily let their children vaccinate against pneumococcus.
Parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 krona and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend on vaccines from 300 to 450 thousand krona annually.
No clutch will save in treatment, which is needed for children who are not vaccinated.
So far, the state has spent approximately 500,000 of the children's vaccinations annually.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of medium otitis, but also of severe infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Infections in our country die every year according to research in hospitals 28 children not older than 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the cover of the pneumococcal vaccine in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, however, opinions appear that this vaccine may be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example, noted Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Its association has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not fully satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path that we have to take now, mentioned Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health does not, however, want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcus.
At this point we do not think at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná společnost praktických dětských lekařę Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children receive the vaccine, they can reason on the reduction in the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we understand the political decision to have initiated vaccination as voluntary," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents will allow their babies to be vaccinated against pneumococces.
The pneumococcal vaccine is also a major change because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines for themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some Members, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "get the money out of health insurance".
The doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40,000 a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in "the theft of a museum"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at US$20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while carrying 90 frames on his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to enter the museum, in the region of the Pocono Mountains.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his representation of such characters as Conan the Barbaro and Tarzan.
The News Agency Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer claimed that a family dispute might have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, aged 52, declared before the police that his father had ordered him to "enter the museum by any means to transfer all the pictures to a warehouse".
The agency said that Frazetta father refused to grant such permission.
Labour Party Supports Tax Increases in Budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and cuts in expenditure in the pre-budget report, in view of the criticism of the opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling "lost" an opportunity to show its seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for damaging low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a rise of 0.5% of social security expenditure and a 1% rate in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
The unions have regretted that low-paid workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems".
The increase in social security spending, which will grow about £3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which says this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
Key points of the previous report to the budget
Social security with an additional 0.5 % increase from April 2011
Economics will be more than expected 4.75 % this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonds
1 point raise in small company tax was discarded
Tax reliefs for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5 %
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance, a person who wins £30,000 will lose £90 per year and who wins £40,000 will lose £90, while a person who wins £10,000 per year will gain £110.
Ministers said their objective of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "hard decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on 5% of the higher wages.
The Minister of Finance, Stephen Timms, denied that the tax rises and cuts in expenditure outlined were a "grain grain in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are large figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit by half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years," the BBC told him.
Mr. Timms said he had confidence that the economy would grow again towards the end of the year.
However, the predictions of the Labour Party regarding future economic growth, which will influence the amount of borrowing and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance has been forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably be contracted by 4.75% this year, much worse than the decrease of 3.5% predicted in April, while the demand for loans would be £3 billion above what was previously estimated.
"Oportunity wasted"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the "debt crisis" of the Labour Party, said that the projection of a loan application for £ 789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, avoiding " cynically" difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it and they have wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the elections, win who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police should be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a further reduction in the deficit in the shorter term.
But Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "sand castles".
The BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, said that the time chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some disability subsidies in April mentioned above, would leave the Minister of Finance exposed to accusations of electoral maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that the people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False assumption"
Although the ministers did not publish spending data after 2011, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said that the Finance Minister's figures involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transport, higher education, science and defence.
"This is really postponing the pain later," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important ads will come after the election, win who wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant for Deloitte's accountants.
"This was the false pre-budget report. Markets realize this."
The FBI is investigating the "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy of Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghode, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI said it's investigating whether they're the same men who disappeared from their homes in Virginia, U.S.A., last month.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about men.
Three of them are reported to be Pakistani, one Egyptian and the other Yemeni.
"If they're American citizens, of course we're going to be very interested in the charges they've been arrested for and in what kind of circumstances they're being held back," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if in fact these are the students who were missing," said the spokesman.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said that the men were arrested in a house that belongs to the uncle of one of them.
He said that the house was already in the sight of the local police and that charges had not yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, reported the news agency Reuters; but said that the United States had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details "the patterns of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights history.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
The thousands of people arrested and the dozens killed in Iran after the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad provoked the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Jamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance to criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the story of 26-year-old Ebrahim Mehtari, a computer student who claimed he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the result of the elections.
"They often hit me in the face" according to their words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under their eyes, on their necks, their head... they threatened to execute me and they humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and released him and left him on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some protesters arrested after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the charges of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was held in a container along with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the ill-being of post-election and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the parliamentary committee's investigations had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
It was made a ski track in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn Bristol's site of interest into a racetrack.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump ramp, facing a 100-metre long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite frightening.
You see it under a beautiful view of the lights of the city titillating.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent," he added.
The prizes were given to the best tricks or maneuvers made on the track.
After the event on Thursday afternoon, the snow will melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for the construction of minarets to be banned and where there is a widespread warning of the supposed Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American scholar, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why French don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It has been months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students about the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a city (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These are apparently worldly issues, he maintains, things of everyday life, those that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, professors and intellectuals, none of them of fame, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadán, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They cannot fully disseminate this argument.
Conservatives only doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr Bowen interviewed tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the Purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
He questions the extent to which the French political strategists (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims probably have a more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives "a value adjustment".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most devastating panorama in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, leading to life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have focused on recently opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result of this.
In "On Thin Ice", Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and the politics of whaling, it describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave valuable evidence facing the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's meeting as a brave 14-year-old cadet, fighting only at the end of his mosque, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
The cubs, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are usually a millionth of the area of a wild adult. The climate is hardly ever adequate: a polar bear resident in Singapore has become green by the algae that grow within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis resorts to stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, the United States and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and skid Indians in snowmobiles use high-power assault rifles to take down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and an overwhelming look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It's not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It's not because of a lack of commitment.
The pioneer travels of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries gave clues to the movement of ice masses for the first time.
Then the cold war submarines drew a map of the moving ice cords circulating under the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted on icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the floating system inside the Arctic ice, made up of saltwater jets that are compressed as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice is withdrawn, which is believed to occur at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months ... these could be us
Marines among the 6,000 that put crowns on Arlington's graves
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown in the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood on their boots.
Within a few months, from where we are boarding, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it were us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning to place crowns in the tombs of the veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, began the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey every year stopping in different cities along the way, to conduct events dedicated to military and terrorist victims.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the graves of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he traveled to Arlington in honor of his husband, a late military career.
As long as her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way of giving a remuneration to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Surrounded in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers went to the oldest graves of the First World War, the Second World War, and the Vietnam War, because they did not receive as many visits as the new graves, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples took hold of their hands, while carrying the fresh pine to the gravestones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red tie tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the Soldier) donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud carved names in the stones, while others inclined to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet clay, for those whose stones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of the marine artillery Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . my son paid for it, he said.
"A long time after my death, I want someone to remember."
Cuban officers arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor distributing mobiles and laptops in the country, the State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on customer projects such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers together with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
Specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested for almost anything that is considered "dangerous".
All activities called counter-revolutionary, which include mild protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has requested on several occasions permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor can probably cause tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, who has been seeking a "slow pace" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to announce the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete action, such as the liberation of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new products and codified in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobiles only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, since a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors of the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer in the United States Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are in prison for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly unwarranted.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing free mobiles, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas programme of the Human Rights Watch organization, who recently published a hard report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro himself Cuba", a reference to Raúl Castro's location as leader of the country, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials are upsetting a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, expressing their hope that the case could help detach an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who use the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
The researchers said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah directed the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the Qaeda commanders that men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke from anonymity due to the delicateness of the case.
The official said that the men were not immutable and were even trying to obtain adequate approval for access to the Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani police authorities.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, stresses the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determine who are of confidence.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. intelligence has made it the main priority to try to infiltrate people within Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting go those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who may be spies.
Analysts said that al Qaeda analyzes with special attention the aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, because of their potential to have access to American goals and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years than they admit, because American intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than following the recruitment model than so many have already followed? Kohlmann said.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate "action"
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched down the streets demanding the negotiators working at the Bella Center Convention Center in the city, the boldest actions for the climate.
The protesters said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the amount was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city holding signs in English saying "There's no planet B" and one in Spanish declaring, "The Earth says "it's enough."
Several celebrities joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that Peru's trips, the country of her mother's birth, made me aware of the distressing issues with which the country must deal due to the impacts of the climate change that is already happening."
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great manifestation, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, he made.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it for longer.
The police prevented the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or wearing pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in the climate talks, activists with sports masks and black outfits placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were by the buildings, he said, adding that they started as calls, but they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march all afternoon.
But the protest did not appear to penetrate the consciousness of key officials such as His Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When he was asked whether he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I was really not aware of the situation."
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of each one to define whether the march was harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and of different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Evidence reveals persistent racial differences
The federal notebook of ratings last week on math performance, was very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country's best-performing systems, the Scorebook showed that the fourth and eighth grade students have given a faster pace over the last two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Education Progress Assessment is the persistent difference in performance between African American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white students in the fourth grade of D.C. over the last two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance gap grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, decreasing a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average scores of whites were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Throughout a six-year extension, the picture is not more encouraging.
The difference between white and black pupils in the fourth grade in 2003 when the first ENPE in the District was announced was 60 points from the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only been reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by meeting those on the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates educational equity in the District.
I am not jumping for joy by a difference of two or three points, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an astute critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the test scores is that the city's secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly they always want to see the positive signs, and I respect them.
But what worries is that we are not devoting the time and energy necessary for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new Reading Curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students from the higher grades of primary and middle school, who did not dominate the early reading foundations in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a curriculum of mathematics from Kindergarten to sixth degree, which emphasizes games and experiences of real life, which was introduced into the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, who was credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we have to continue to work to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the results of ENPE highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be needed to reduce the difference.
Here is a kind of squabbling dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies scores of urban tests.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the goal can generate political impacts that go against that important timeline.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban overseers, she tries to hold on to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now overseer of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance difference is to extend the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes almost 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year in a year of 185 days, who considers it a "indicator" to seek a larger increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of the future
The tourist bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a strong response.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12, went down and blinked for a moment in front of white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where registration costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! This is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, whom she would like to study medicine, when the guide announced they had entered the science building.
Caray, really?, he thoughtfully said, when the guide talked about the low proportion of school teachers-students.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh one the children had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you're going to college.
The question is which.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access university education that they need to get to the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second-generation" Hispanics graduated from college, a notable achievement as many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, as they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's workforce.
Those who analyze those with higher performance say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her reach the university, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Observing low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it is deduced that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We need to consider providing a support network for these children, from the kindergarten to secondary school.
The federal program that funded the tour of Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as the GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to implement university preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue to finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in the restoration of the Iraqi oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
The American companies have moved away, having climbed into only two of the 10 submerged deposits.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who presented an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for substantiated deposits in June.
The poor representation of American oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It'll be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military retreats, probably prevented US oil companies from risking more vigorously in Iraq, which has the world's third largest crude reserve, analysts said.
American companies were at a disadvantage in some cases because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreement with the ministry.
The major American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have close ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away empty-handedly.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Oil Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered in more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two major deposits.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesperson of the Assam Jihad Petroleum Ministry.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be alongside its competitors and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the barrel grant that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels at each site.
The main Qaeda planner has apparently been murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that an alleged U.S. missile attack on the Pakistan border with Afghanistan has killed a leading Qaeda operations planner this week, US counter-terrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men who is thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal zone of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading for the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a civil intelligence officer from Pakistan, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said that the suspected local militants rushed to the spot and quickly confiscated what was left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-ranking military planner for Qaeda, who led the terrorist group operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiracy all over the world, said a senior official, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of American air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to the top command of al Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had climbed rapidly in the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat posed to us and to our allies, said the second official.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second leader of the Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of unmanned aircraft attacks led by the CIA has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to an account by The Long War Journal, a website led by a non-profit organization.
The decrease may be due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly killing suspected informants, said the site.
The UN's maximum envoy in Kabul about to resign
The United Nations Chief Envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign his post in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was adversely affected by widespread corruption accusations in the UN-backed Afghanistan presidential election.
Eide's departure occurs when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase, but he was concerned that the US military withdrawal schedule that began in 18 months would encourage other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of the Afghan security forces and send the correct signal to the Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian officials, who collaborate with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civil sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so I had time to find a replacement.
What I've said is that it's better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and of covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said that Galbraith's accusations, who was fired, "certainly damaged the mission, because there was already a lot of scepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said that he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the United States-led assistance efforts in Afghanistan.
It also promoted the leadership of the United Nations to allow its successor to recruit more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase their confidence in the correct use of their money.
Eide expressed frustration over the limitations on its powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the overwhelming UN recruitment regulations undermined its ability to capture talent.
So the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran, for their failure to engage in talks about their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 US troops in northern Iraq, during a one-week war zone trip in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the probability of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that, if we've learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it's the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions directed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less secure with nuclear weapons", because "his people will suffer enormously" the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "believable" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would renegotiate on the restriction of his nuclear programme and agree to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for the fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for this agreement, as a way of building trust between the two parties and making time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved away from the tempting agreements, in part, the experts say, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of engagement with the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October, has united the international community, including Russians and Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline on December 31st for Iran to respond to the proposals, before considering any other options, even continuing with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "disposing sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday "unfounded and baseless accusations", by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said it has the will to continue with talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was returning to Washington last Friday, met Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning, before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential for the conflict, to avoid any delay in United States projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety over the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted the words of Gates to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that preached to them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more tomb."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aged population of their city, suddenly changed their course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31 years old, a human resources administrator with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of a single child's policy in China, creating two generations of notoriously recognised children, single children who are malactivated, affectionately nicknamed "small emperors", is emerging a demographic crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has dropped to 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six when the policy was implemented, according to the Division
The United Nations population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to increase from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 3.1 per cent by 2050, which is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of Shanghai's Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, has stated that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and mitigate a future shortage of labour."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A Progressive Relief
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, the policy of a single son of China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced by the Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for their contribution to avoiding critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the fetus sex, leading to a high unnatural male-woman ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their position on the single child policy.
In 2004, more exceptions were made to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 many of their hard-line slogans were mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Demographic Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government officials have been discussing recently even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost at night in the morning, the posters that ordered families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very low.
Disappointment Response
Although rural city officials on the outskirts of Shanghai maintain that they have seen a moderate increase in the requests of couples who want a second child after the campaign is launched, the most urban districts indicate no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Municipality of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give their first child their best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, aged 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, aged 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally empowered to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they say, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudged the policy of a single child as a matter of rights, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant by the couple's first child.
Yeah, they're stealing from us the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources administrator, said he wants a unique child because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were used to all taking care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, owner of a translation agency, explained it more strongly.
For middle-class parents who reduce the birth rate, he said, it is about having enough success to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up seeing their parents' struggle during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and they don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even one child requires a lot of time from the parents, he said.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are questions of space, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategic has to "have a curriculum prepared for the best day care centers when the child is 9 months old."
Most of your friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, has attracted renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations that carry most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not speak of how much money the rich countries would give to the poor to cope with global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature increase that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process," said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's top climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the great panorama."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 per cent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, Friday presented the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks last week.
United States Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern rejected the assertions calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared with volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is adopting a tougher line with China, with respect to what the Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without the major developing countries moving forward and taking action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs He Yafei said that the U.S. climate negotiator lacked "common sense", or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are discussing who should cost the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive trying to contain the major emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, Ulate said, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants said that talks would produce a political agreement at the very least.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, drew up a preliminary treaty proposal of 24 pages early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now unified and demand the action of emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most exceptional issues before the heads of government came to an end.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and rushed to the Bella Center corridors, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delimit the claims that will be made during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people come in and out of the convention center every day, the guitar activists show night shows mocking the countries they think are selling, and preliminary proposals are hand-in-hand instead of mail), poses a challenge.
Intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here at the moment, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for the global policy of International Conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
The first train to 225 km from Britain redefines that feeling of Monday
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to point out a train departure that marks a revolution for travel to Britain.
The country's first high-speed interurban train will reach 225 km, passing like a lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Pancas station in London, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then join Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin interurban service outside London.
He expects the new service to finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would shorten and the shift of planes and cars to the railway would reduce national emissions of coal, as would road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds that are needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still slow Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next phase planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the Midlands of the West will be drawn within a five-meter radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a final route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option that is being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Peninsulas to Manchester and Scotland, and another heading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One line would enter Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial option," said a railway member.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be inaugurated before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over one current hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel to 402 kmh, turning the British network into the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is being designed to withstand trains of 400 mt in length, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate on a London-Birmingham line every hour.
This means that a London terminal would be needed to receive 20,000 passengers an hour.
Considering the restrictions on the space of the capital, an existing station is expected to be extended to fit the high-speed network.
Experts from the railway industry argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work starts, the network would have to be built in sections.
Trains would initially be forced to leave the fast lines on existing lanes north of Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to ensure a change of aircraft to trains, a point of reference for the railway revolution.
The taxpayers face the mortgage for an orange £75,000 from a Conservative.
Alan Duncan, the spokesperson of the Conservative Party, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange that he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the deputies lived "of rations", increased his mortgage by £75.000 to build an extension framed in oak in his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of the members' expenses. Last night Mr. Duncan said that the applications "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, has a two-storey house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Honorary Office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "anranjal".
The neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan during a recent inquiry by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons into its previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee absolved him from violating the rules, after an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of £271,406 from his London property to the house of his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a Member.
The documents circulated this week show that Mr. Duncan was applying for approximately 1,400 pounds per month in mortgage interests, until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate of Mr. Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland's mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the whole increase would finance the loan of £75,000.
The standard variable mortgage rate of the BRE fell from 7.94 per cent in December 2007, to 4 per cent in March this year, the type now found.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to apply for £1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as president of the House's opposition in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying that the deputies had to survive "of rations" after the expense scandal.
"This is basically nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated as m**rda."
He said, "I spend my money in my garden and ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for much more, but I don't."
The deputy, a millionaire for his former occupation as an oil merchant, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the sterling symbol on Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after revealing that he had requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when he was asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for primordial improvements, both approved by the salary office and later by Legg."
He added: "It is not about escaping and delinquing or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could not be in any way clearer or simpler."
Come those who have faith, to see the Calendar of the Brighton Beach Face Adventure
Brighton's palates have found a new boost for the winter months in an interactive event calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palates every December, using villains as their theme.
The event began on 1 December, with guests who could see the last palate from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with stuffed pastries and ponche served free of charge.
The elected villains so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a unpaid clergyman of the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said, "We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we expect as a Church people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the Paapa's Adventure calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and throughout the world
Tens of thousands of demonstrators protested this Saturday in complaint of an ambitious and binding agreement to combat global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded through the Danish ice capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday. It would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to "the political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the beginning of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with docks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people in total, according to the police, they are especially members of the Black Blocks, ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were arrested "without distinctions", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the seat of the negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was raised to welcome the guest speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a vigil with candles.
Most protesters arrived by bus and train from the large European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present like some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with celestial plumbers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" by "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to claim compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying: there's time, the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo said.
In Africa, rivers are drying up, watercourses for which you can walk as never before could be done.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world".
The Pacific Asia region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial kick to demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people went to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans for solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, concentration was formed by hundreds of demonstrators who claimed to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, a prorussian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, the participation was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on the night of Saturday through Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including outgoing president Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved voting.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili, "wails that Abkhazia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following his separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousands of deaths, Abkhaz tried to prove through this election that he was ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new state as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large paintings show Bagapch next to the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the district chief Beslan Archba warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to control the development of the poll.
In a brief ceremony, he said, "We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate Moscow's support, and particularly the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will be recognized quickly by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting his vodka vase.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia control of the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current power or opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people came to the streets of the world to claim an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where the police, on alert, stopped more than 700 people around an impressive demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the middle of the cold of the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The very peaceful demonstration came out of Parliament and went to the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the center, without attempting to enter.
A stage was raised to welcome the guest speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a vigil with candles.
A few moments after the demonstration began, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the floor.
The police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people stating that they were mainly members of the Black Blocks, ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with a dock, and four cars were burned near a occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, according to the police.
To the extremist groups we did not take our eyes off, I warn the police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the large cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present like some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with celestial plumbers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" by "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to claim compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, told the AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "unit climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world".
The Oxfam organization, together with the former UN Commissioner for Refugees, Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Pacific Asia region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial kick to demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people went to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, showed red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favour of solar energy in front of the Philippine Capital City Hall.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators called for action against climate change were formed.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that will be transmitted in the Sunday Informative (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" by the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all students of the first bachelor's degree will have four hours a week and the same programme for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "ends with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "Branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "generally summons the best students".
The branches of General and Literary Teaching cannot be superseded by C, it goes on to stress even: "I have not heard that historians or intellectuals were outraged to have eliminated history and geography in second degree of baccalaureate in technological schools."
An IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven French people of ten (69%) disapproved of the government's project to eliminate mandatory history-geography teaching in second degree of Bachelor's degree C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected right-wing representatives also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "there is no talk" of eliminating philosophy from the second bachelor's program C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teaching, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, they will give proof of admission that they will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, a proof of admission on their teaching ability, explained the Minister.
In addition, they will practice in real conditions during the year of M2, they will then be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practice.
If you do all the practices proposed prior to the competition, you will already have great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to delete the school map "before 2012".
At the High School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain in a convincing way the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit, a challenge that accepted on Saturday morning Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street High School.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, opened the conference panel "Ernest", a day composed of a series of fifteen-minute presentations of experts, filmed and open to the public, reported an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that would appeal to people and transmit them a desire to know more, explained at the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish of the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants from the experts in his discipline and selected them on his charismatic side, he specified.
About global warming, "we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," he told AFP Jean Jouzel, who exhibited without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed hoping that the public will understand that "the Copenhagen conference is founded on an extremely serious scientific record".
The videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school's website from December 15th.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: Distaste among prison guards, action is expected
The prison guards' unions called for a "general mobilization" on Friday to demand payment before the end of the year, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers' Force (2nd Guard Union) asked out-of-service personnel to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to denounce the theft of their assets.
The prison CGT (3rd union of the profession) summons them to "meeting in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a mass mobilization", as it calls " shameful and unacceptable" the non-compliance of payment in December of the "extra hours, evening premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first guard union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellor reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guards' unions ensuring that payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I request the Directorate of the Prison Administration to implement immediately a set of measures to ensure that this situation caused by a poor evaluation of the extra hours does not occur again in the future.
The December payment will then be scarce, except for management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and purposes, and who "always blames the budgetary requirements", deplored the Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, he said outraged the interregional union FO de Marseille, announcing his decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if the month of October is not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time when our tasks and missions are increasing without more effective, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff salary, the Burdeos Prison CGT estimates.
According to trade unions, not in all regions is the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than the ones he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first Family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous TV host Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive."
During a special interview that ABC will issue on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the year-end parties in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be from the game.
Pa Noel also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will receive "of course" a gift, according to the statements of the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he receives: "No way, last year I made you nice gifts," he said provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before answering humorously pointing to the First Lady's Pearl Necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devoutly supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite children's gifts.
Barack Obama remembered a bike with two speeds, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, said the President.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, rather than accommodate them around the house, but I loved that dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims he's in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was once again involved in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" arising from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to its neighbours, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to a coma induced to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened on Wednesday night to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors found "injuries from the operation" of discal hernia performed in Paris on 26 November, he pointed out his press service in that same city, indicating that such injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey peace of mind by claiming that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would communicate within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "sickness and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more sure about their condition, add RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" it would not have been introduced any cannula after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic due to a discal hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days ago, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday joined the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection derived from the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained on Thursday in RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time," but assured that "no problem" was done because the rocker is "a fighter".
He called me just before he traveled to Los Angeles, and I told him it was silly to make twelve hours of plane after such an operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician Jean-Claude Camus intended to reassure him that Johnny Hallyday, "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had talked with Laeticia, the musician's wife, and he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed having been operated on a "column cancer", after a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been exaggerated. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the musician to move on stage.
In mid-November, their allies even had to deny a new internment.
Euro-2009/short swimming pool: first title of Bousquet at your favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist in the World Wide Pool-2009, obtained an international title on Thursday at a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in a short swimming pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane bathers were allowed for the last time, only three records of the world were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, brand with long swimming pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was imposed with 20''53 during an end where they competed ten swimmers instead of eight as usual, an international premiere.
Bousquet preceded Croat Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world brand (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane bathers from 1 January will be banned.
These swimmers, from 238 world records since February 2008, end their epopey in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of bathers did not help the German Paul Biedermann, the world's double champion in the long swimming pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his brand by 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he imposed himself with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up at all in this race.
I knew that this time I was not going to be able to record a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
US: a panel of sarcophagus belonging to Zola sold in USD 1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to the French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday in $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art dealer.
This panel of 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated from $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "that represents four dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satires and drunken women, is an unusual piece, as there are only four or five in the world," explained AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions from ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most uploaded by buyers, no doubt pointed out to AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For nearly 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of his bath in his particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before the Marshal Pétain took power.
For some fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, one year after the author's death of "Therèse Raquin" and the fresh "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras Aborted the Departure from Zelaya to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico considered that the conditions were not given to transfer to its territory to the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the coup government denied the safe conduct.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of the transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa declared.
The Mexican government plane that arrived on Wednesday to El Salvador to take to Zelaya returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
In order to grant him a safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "renunciate" and ask for political asylum abroad.
But the defeated president refused because he wanted to reach Mexico as Head of State in guest exercise.
The coup government "has suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my office (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya said on Thursday on radio Globo, in which he has usually made statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has taken five months in Central America.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, he added by playing some chords the retired president, refugee at the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
Mexico's embassy presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we were unable to accept it for not containing an asylum application, said on Wednesday the Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, on Honduran radio HRN.
I will not seek asylum from any country, responded Manuel Zelaya in an interview at the Telesur chain, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This reflects the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, when he had organized a referendum to prepare his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on 21 September and took refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and must respond to the Justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial poll, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until the end of its term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street goes up, the U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Thursday, the US trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic reactivation of both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67%; and Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405,83 points, and the Nasdaq, technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market concentrated "on the average full vessel".
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on US trade balance figures, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared to September, at $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected, on the contrary, a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of trade volumes, in particular the exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies they trade with the United States, Christopher Cornell, of the Economy.com research company, commented.
On the other hand, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants "has been the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury Bond's return amounted to 3,482 per cent against 3,423 per cent on Tuesday night, and the 30-year bond to 4,492 per cent against 4,408 per cent on Tuesday evening.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power over the "Damas de Blanco"
This Thursday, hundreds of supporters of the Cuban power ministered to the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the world day of human rights and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty "Damas de Blanco", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked to the center of the capital demanding the release of such detainees, he supported a journalist from the AFP.
The Yankees die!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Liva Fidel and Raúl!"reed with their fists the power militants to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian-dressed agents who came to "protect them."
On the eve, a similar demonstration was unleashed against the "Damas de Blanco" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, about a dozen dissidents who were also about to protest on Thursday for the international day of human rights, was arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, reported a journalist from the AFP.
The agents forced the vehicles to dissidents who were bullied by government supporters, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Damas de Blanco", awarded with the 2005 Sajarov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to dissent, declared one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, purges a 20-year prison sentence.
Macedonia is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of which 53 are still behind bars.
Cuban authorities call on opponents of "mercenaries" or "agents" to pay for their declared enemy, the United States.
A rare fact in the media, Cuban television reported on the demonstration on Thursday of government militants against "counterrevolutionaries".
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
A crippled killer with an octogenary with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Seine) on Thursday at the time of the greatest inflow of the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have struck with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an elder, in the pharmacy or in front of it in the 85th Jean-Jaurès boulevard, reported police sources and witnesses.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a head of the Alliance Police Union.
Then at the pharmacy or in front of her, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, stood up and was wounded.
The first two seriously injured victims were transferred to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other wounded, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a fainting and was hospitalized "in a state of shock," reported a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently by chance, he would have hurt two more pedestrians: a man of thirty, and a man of forty gravely.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives that had crossed his back, explained instead a leader of the Alliance union in the Upper Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several transients, including young people, tried to control the internally displaced, according to the testimonies obtained by the AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s wearing a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, Albert explained, the bar waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd threw him over, among them a police officer who broke his wrist, added.
By the Jean-Jaurès boulevard, at the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to stop the armed man and were stabbed, according to the police's testimony.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Some people came to tell me there was a man injured in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. By putting him in a safe position, I felt a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person arrived about 35 years old, with knife wounds.
National police personnel arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office has submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Highs of the Seine (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his provisional detention, he had not said that.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all disturbed of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again asks that the case be dismissed
Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski's lawyer again claimed this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), who refuses the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of "El Pianista", denounced before three judges of the Appeals Chamber of the Second District of California grave procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I demand that the charges be dismissed at the same time, since the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "resulted chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (lost since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison before sentencing, which is a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September "to have lied" to the documentary author.
Hummel appealed for a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the rejection of the case.
The accusation, for its part, reiterated the argument made at first instance, that there could be no serious assessment of any dismissal of the charges as Roman Polanski had not been brought before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "illegal sexual relations" with a child under 13.
Since then, he has never stepped on the United States again.
Los Angeles district deputy prosecutor Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "must be here to present himself to the audience."
With this cause, we want to transmit the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is a chance to flee?, Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "requests a favor to the court, even though he despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to deliver his sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
He contends that her client no longer supports her being harassed every time the Polanski case comes back, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months after the bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad cabin, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street loses its course and slows down the dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed this undirected Friday, in a market that is debated between better indicators than the US and the dollar rise: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points reaching 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technological component, lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 increased by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management said.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is getting smaller and I think it will be maintained until the end of the year.
The trend remained due to the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve the market's view of the robustness of economic reactivation", summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per second consecutive month in November and higher than expected.
In addition, the confidence of US consumers recovered visibly in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were hampered by a further advance in the dollar that reached the highest level in the last two months compared to the euro, which " leads down to sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury Bond's return amounted to 3,540 per cent compared to 3,482 per cent on Wednesday night, and the 30-year-old bonus was 4,497 per cent against 4,492 per cent on the eve.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's tour of South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss Mundo's title are in the final line to fulfill her dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world against a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of the beauty organized for the second consecutive year around Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran from Mexico, Mariatu Ka rgbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Sportsman or even Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real riot.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I've seen so many things and I've lived countless experiences!," said Miss Sierra Leone.
This event, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast on Saturday live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m. (15 p.m. GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, says Miss Mundo Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that remove the breath".
After a month of galas, essays, press wheels and safaris, Miss Mundo candidates focus on the event.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted to Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a great smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, with bathrobe.
Chinese host, Angela Chow, the former queen of South African beauty, Michelle McLean, and a head of the Miss Mundo committee, Steve Douglas, will lead the event.
South Africa proved to be able to receive the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss Mundo event.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time on bicycle, and tasted local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Something unusual for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I treated people I never thought I'd get to know.
Probably back to the 2010 World Cup, says enthusiastic Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," David said his son on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is coming out very well, told the press David Hallyday when he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13 h local (21 h GMT).
The singer's son, disbanded, assured that he would move "how long before" to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday due to an infection resulting from the discal hernia operation on 26 November in Paris.
The musician is "in induced coma from that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday for an infection, a sequel to a discal hernia operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated once again on Wednesday night through Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness a school act, confirmed a photographer of the AFP.
The Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catone, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be next to the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic at Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
It's talking about a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, because I was operated twice by discal hernia, he added.
Shortly before in the RTL station, he indicated that the singer had apparently "gone without a candle, without anything," after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, Charlotte Gainsbourg also intervened to reabsorb a haematoma formed following a brain hemorrhage.
He is a reputable physician, convicted for justice on several occasions by malapraxis, as well as by tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a unscrupulous man" accused "with regularity" before the Council of Order, and is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
It indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the post-operative studies were "normal".
The operation "couldn't cause hemorrhage and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Anyway, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since summer, entered a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, to resume the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, seems to me very risky, Camus declared.
The UDF Association raises the tone and warns the New Center on the use of its acronym
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) association, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem (Dem), reacted this Friday to the attempt of the President of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the acronym of the former Giscardist party, urging him to withdraw it from any support, so sorry to be sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF, since he considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having stretched his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of its management, Mr Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, current NC) was assisted by Mr Hervé de Charette, who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF association's office, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and to the Member by insinuating them to renounce the acronym and transfer the rights of ownership of the brand, under the penalty of judicial demand.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose your political movement to recover the so-called UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the name of the movement, the +Nouveau center+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in their militant material and on the site presentation page, they support the signatures of the letter.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to "promotely withdraw the name of the UDF from all media, as well as (your) website."
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of (the) brand to legitimate residents".
Failure to do so would require justice to enforce the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, warning the signatories.
In the letter, they need that UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chosen" went in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Centre does not, according to them, have any right to use the so-called UDF.
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 for its membership in MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the brand", he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years," but a member of the UMP.
Use scandalously and fraudulently the absence of registration of the UDF acronym to perform it on your own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make their own name than to try to get out of anonymity by taking a name that is not entitled to."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to sue artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as stated by the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt's daughter, she took advantage of the state of octogenary weakness to expel her from part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos of the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment and 375,000 euros of fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga over one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the Correctional Court no. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87, to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such examinations, even more in the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors designated this Friday will be required to submit a report before 10 March 2010 in which they will report whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weaknesses and during which periods.
I think he'll accept.
I'm going to talk to her, said Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, on leaving the audience.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's single daughter has initiated criminal actions against François-Marie Banier, photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing her of having taken advantage of her mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom he considered a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the origin of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the allegations of lawyers sometimes resulted in a great family confession.
In this way Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters his client had sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said he was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer, "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again."
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office once again considered that the complainant was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardian judge refused, in recent days, to make a request to initiate a legal guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under guardianship and has no tutor.
No one else can appear in his place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Christitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be delivered once the trial had been held.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is the question of employees joining the above-mentioned "values" as it was before to impose products on consumers thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to market conquest strategies... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to customers' preference factors is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end up in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives particularly.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R & D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all parties involved (...) have proactive conduct and a prospective vision"; it requires employees to undertake a commitment that is totally opposed to the recommendations of an authoritative management.
For this reason, we called for a managerial revolution, which would be to put the collaborators at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the client.
Internal opinion surveys have a relative usefulness
Will internal opinion polls, such as Orange's questionnaire among his employees, incite the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I could verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many rounds, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great engineering schools, they interpret psychology in a mechanical way.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old driving theory that the American "neurosciences" recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely disseminated behind them.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent research by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the managers in a position of mechanical management, inadequate to the world today.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, means adopting a finalist view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into all reasoning or business management practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is possible only if it appears clearly as a means to make reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Reason Analysis adopt this conception of employees' motivations.
The studies showed that they judge their company on the basis of a default dose that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of mobilisation factors, business managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resources management "in place".
In this way, they create a favourable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Address by Oslo: for the "Just War" Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the American right, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, exclaimed Obama's speech on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited Obama's award on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice-president during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, said Mrs. Palin, the main figure of the right wing of the Republican party to the USA Today newspaper, and added that she had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memories.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered the president to have done "very good work" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, the former President of the House of Representatives was delighted, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At the moment, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich said, during an interview with the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, some of whom consider a possible candidate for Republican investiture for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a left-wing president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or could deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current Washington Post chronicler, Obama gave "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as "the citizen of the world", as "always does", "he spoke as an American president" by reminding Europeans "who live in a security bubble that they did not create and do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wing, a hawk of the Bush era, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "monoton, pretentious and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
However, the left-centre press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, although still believing that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," said the California newspaper enthusiastically.
Obama "pronounced the speech that was necessary," said the New York Times, judging him "at the same time as gloomy and edifying."
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three marathon negotiations, the road sector trade unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon to an agreement ending the strike slogan and the threat of Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of State of Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "joyed" by the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators fired at the dawn of Friday in the hope of quickly signing the text according to the last morning.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRA) withdrew by giving a door.
But a meeting of more than six hours which began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very harmful to companies" and "was afraid it would disturb the holidays of the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for lower wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9 per cent for higher wages (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from EUR 8.72 to 9.06 for low wages.
Not much, but we start with a lot of disadvantage, Patrice Clos explained (FO).
If so, we will order our militants that there will be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centres.
But there can always be some dissenting rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it is "a good deal", although it was "hard to grant increases to high wages in the light of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and which respects employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) acknowledged it as "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) is an "acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010 which will enable, above all, the issue of extraordinary payment and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a downturn of 100 million euros in employers' expenses" was the subject of an amendment by the government in the draft correction finance bill for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies which are members of this organization and, secondly, to the whole profession if the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "with the utmost urgency," Bussereau said.
The opposition of employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a "ingenuous business", as the EUR 100 million "were already promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas dinner, the Unostra was regretted.
For the OTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, trade unions disagree with RATP proposals
The conflicts in RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, because at the Friday meeting, the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the RATP leadership, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their request for premium.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, Saturday and Sunday will only circulate trains between 10:00 and 20:00, because of a train every two in the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and a train every four in the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Galleries Lafayette, which wait for 200,000 customers every day, were glad that "the RATP strives to provide service to large shops".
The RER A crosses from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one in two trains traveled in peak hours, and almost no train in valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the Andes thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Island of France.
Thus, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), a 29-year-old engineer, Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "one and a half hours earlier to arrive at time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF indicated that it had provided for the supervision of police and law enforcement forces.
The RER A that operates the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general assemblies of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting that was held with management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RRs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RRA A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers who claim a premium they are owed, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even parentheses its premium proposals, commented indignantly on the CGT, noting that the address "was unable to solve a problem that SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "extensive analysis of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", RATP said.
This also led the unions to say that the company "does not care about the users of the weekend".
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
So the direction, which was denied until then to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents submitted a warning.
Trade unions claim a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line with one million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros premiums, for alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the procured party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main procuring party, a decision that immediately provoked manifestations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the Southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task, which has just helped the Kurdish community to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party of the Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that undermine the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", said the press President of the Court, Hasim Kiliz, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to obtain the dissolution, noted Kiliç, and added that 37 of the party's leaders, including his President Ahmet Türk and Mrs Aysel Tugluk, were removed from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament before they were parliamentarians without a party label.
The decision stems from a proceeding launched by the Supreme Court Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007, who accuses DTP of obeying the “principles” of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party asserts that it does not have "organic ties" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict intervenes at the time when the government lends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, so that the Kurds will stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders stated that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in the Southeast anatolyst, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of demonstrators met in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large town of the Southeast, mostly populated by Kurds.
The Order Forces threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while the protesters launched Molotov bombs or deep stones.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of justice was going to "deepen the disappointment".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by dissolving a party, told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
We initially oppose the closure of parties.
Thus nothing can be resolved, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can, of course, expect a PKK reaction, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in Northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
The snows can start suddenly
A truly fresh winter is what Wolfgang Braubburger wants.
It's absolutely nothing that you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in the winter of the EDF
But with this, their employees can learn to test and master the entire vehicle technology.
Maybe the weekend meteorologists will announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the EDF acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as snow profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A sections with large salt vehicles, explains Braubburger.
These include, for example, major arteries and avenues such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the accesses to the firefighters' body, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and tracks with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The EDF service starts about three a.m.
It must cover approximately 1,040 kilometres, as necessary, within a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That's why the EDF starts about three o'clock in the morning, "with this the roads are free until the traffic of the peak hours starts."
The difficult thing is when it starts snowing around 7:30 a.m.
"Then we have a problem," says the road maintenance director in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for salt vehicles."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, to which Rat-Beil-Straße also belongs.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where trouble is generated, Braubburger knows well.
Around 5:00 a.m., the EDF infantry is launched, mainly the dangerous and cruise points are cleared.
In general, the EDF could not take care of the entire bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 a.m. does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Braubburger.
As these become quick swings, the salt vehicle will start as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of an emergency, the police may call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa Hallae had the same appearance as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-metre-long, 1.50-metre-high animal that ran over the two strong hind legs, had an extended head with sharp teeth and curved curves, short arms with claws in the shape of a hook and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of Texas University in Austin and colleagues in the Science magazine on Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry area of the Supercontinent Pangea in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window towards the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we have found in one day a dozen dinosaur bones, this is something unprecedented for sediments of the Triassic, reports Randall Irmis a member of the team of the Utah Natural History Museum.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remains of five specimens were assembled in total.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other experts in dinosaurs do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, comments for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time approximately 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, the experts discuss, for example, when the savouries were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: carnivorous teropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauros known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia herbivoros (sauri with bird pelvis), to which, for example, belong the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is a primitive teropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the skull of Tawa found the researchers found signs of airbags, such as those that also possessed the offspring of the teropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa findae also the bones of the spine were evidently partially air-filled.
Tawa is the teropod with older and primitive air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the posterior giant sauropods also had air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups would already produce this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, researchers conclude that the sauries arose there for the first time.
Therefore, the three genealogical lineages separated at first and spread from South America across all corners of the Earth, which by then still formed a unique earthly mass, the Pangea supercontinent.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa the remains of two other teropods not closely related.
The three cannot descend from a single related predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three migratory waves were given to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science Study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a group of siblings of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, comments the paleontologist of Bonn Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how the dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to Mesozoic dominant terrestrial vertebrates remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triásic the dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of the current crocodiles and the pterosauries and with many other saurios.
Towards the end of the Triásic the dinosaurs expanded all over the world and developed many new species, while the kinship extinguished at the boundary of the Triásic towards the Jurassic.
Success stories weren't eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
It may have been given a massive extinction to which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could defeat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact brakes the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Teachers from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna and Berkeley, California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen participate.
The police eviction from the occupied casino at Goethe University of Frankfurt has affected the whole world.
278 professors and professors at Goethe University, although also from higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with protest students at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, evicted last week the building occupied by students and teachers in educational strike because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command".
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and diverted the attention of the content.
The Governing Council has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers require the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
The young people of the Verdi Union and the German Federation of Trade Unions are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of growing concern for the future itself, comments the national youth secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the performance of the principal of the university and the police.
We're grateful to the principal of the university.
The destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, commented in an broadcast by Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Parliament of the province of Wiesbaden.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not understanding with vandalism, said Peter Beuth, provincial parliament delegate for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left is different.
The CDU used painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of studying the students' arguments and demands in depth, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret arms investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered the Russian Silicon Valley.
Here are important research and production centers of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, Selenograd representatives have contacted the scientific headquarters of Riedberg in Frankfurt, the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were given and now, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Protocol of Close Collaboration".
Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, they will travel to a seminar in Selenograd, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Natural Science Research Centre.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses business relations.
FIZ companies will be able to set foot on the growing Russian market.
In contrast, Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the seat of important Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronic and Rossijskaja Elektronika consortia.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "City of Socialist Planning" for arms research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, where research facilities were established.
Stuttgart Brakes
The size of Stuttgart 21 is not high enough for anything.
For the project's supporters it is simply and plainly "the new heart of Europe".
The law alone. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which ended in the middle of the city, were considered in that then 19th century engineering fossils, which acted as brakes on a modern rail traffic, as a huge amount of time was needed in the past to bind the locomotives from behind forward.
Roll, stop dry continue the journey; but it must be done.
And that's why the terminals were supposed to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is located about half of the journey of trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will actually be started, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impeccable to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals of course do not have any more input and output problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver car on both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new stretch built ICE towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have arranged this way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the major individual infrastructure projects in the Republic are carried by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, with many green areas, probably from the computer-generated graphics of the designer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time, there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening the transport of goods, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than that carried out by trucks on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than EUR 6 billion must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing in other crosses and narrow passages on the network.
A total of sixty major projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometres of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the trace has been constructed slowly.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator as it is due.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the airport judgement.
The federal government remains pending in the Wiesbaden Autonomous Parliament, if it is going to file an appeal against the ruling on the prohibition of night flights of the Hesse Administrative Court.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have entrusted experts with the legal investigation of the VGH ruling, more than 400 pages, said the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had stated in writing on this date that in the case of the construction of the north-west runway planned at Frankfurt airport, the federated state would need to re-regulate the nocturnal flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as expected by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January whether it is going to file the appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured the representatives of the government to renounce the appeal to the Administrative Court of the Nation in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections; otherwise this could be taken as a lack of words.
It is quite difficult, if one lets his word come true, said the chief of the Green Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We fulfill our word."
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's recrimination, which the federative government would be trying by distorting the law and tricking yet to obtain their nightly flights.
A comprehensive legal investigation would take quite some time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "first rapid print".
We need a legally unbreakable decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition represents it, it would never have been his group's assertions about the nocturnal air traffic ban.
The U.S. banks return the aid provided.
The large U.S. banks rocked by the crisis are stripped of their state bonds.
The "Bank of America" returned only once the aid it had received from the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of €45 billion (approximately €30 billion).
And the Citi group also plans to return state aid, according to a report from the U.S. CNBC.
In this way, the institutes aim to free themselves from the restrictions that had come out of their hands with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The "Bank of America" had obtained approximately 19 billion cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took it from the box itself, which had plenty of means, among others for the sale of rubles.
Banking Director Kenneth Lewis thanked US taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The bank had miscalculated the effort of the absorption of the investment bank in the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to obtain money in the capital market in order to be able to free itself from its obligations vis-à-vis the state.
CNBC reported from known circles that the U.S. bank could already announce for this Thursday its capital increase by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not wish to comment.
In June they had already returned their aid Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
In the end everything was faster than you thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF administrative council (German television channel) pressed the editor Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may present a successor.
Last night the board wanted to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced the not further damage to the director of ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved by the administrative board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The result of the vote was not yet concrete at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative council with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but one failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated that they were not going to support Bender in his position.
The opposition against the editor had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr.Roland Koch.
It declined another mandate of the prestigious editor with the argument, which under the direction of Bender the ZDF information would have lost audience indexes.
Until just before the elections there were protests because of this, in which it flagged the political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, 35 public law specialists, who described Koch as unconstitutional, had even been involved in the debate.
But it didn't do any good.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Roman philology.
He later worked at the "Südwestfunk" station and in the "Frankfurter Rundschau" newspaper.
In 1983 it changed to the ZDF, in principle to the "high-journal" information.
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning programme "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the ZDF study in the capital.
The Greens political party announced a constitutional demand after Brender's removal, which was still elected this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazine".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the president of the Rhine-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federal states should change the ZDF state convention in such a way that the management's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of politicians from the ZDF control boards was dismissed by Beck.
Brender's probable successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the administrative board with a smart move: he strongly criticized the brender removal panel.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence both Schächter was able to appoint him for the post of chief editor without losing his face, as the administrative board could vote him, without falling under suspicion of giving the post to a partisan secutor.
In the calculations of the Frey parties it is awarded anyway to the leftist liberals.
University careers are taking off
Partial success for students: after one year of educational-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally yielded. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the case of undergraduate and master studies.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: basically each career module must end with a single examination.
The aim is also to examine the workload of students, and to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federal states undertake to make structural rules more flexiblely together for Bachelor and Master's careers.
Rules of the federated states that differ from this, must no longer exist.
Fewer examinations
Since the beginning of the student protests in June the Ministers of Education and Culture and the directors of universities have been continuously talking about the improvement of being able to complete and successfully complete a career (studyability).
Now for the first time there was talk of a specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Board agreed to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module ends with a single examination", says in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
With the "sensitive reduction of the burden of examinations" it is intended to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
Moreover, in the future "studyability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as to the unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of..
courses.
Students would have "the right to more spaces, which enable and foster their own initiative."
These rules would apply to new careers, but also to the examination of existing careers.
These must be "reaccredited" again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take up to 2015 to examine all the races.
Those responsible for this would be at the country-wide level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is installed by the federated states.
The ministers of education and culture urged the federated states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the amount of materials and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some federated states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
Until now only Renania-Plantada has ensured that additional means are provided for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement mentoring and student counselling programs, as well as strengthen examination offices and abroad.
The Federal State and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, only one examination should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The configuration of the career should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of the coming year it is intended to examine all the careers about its "studyability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions of study in the federated state.
Apart from the compliments, there were also criticisms of decisions.
In the executive board at the federal level of the Juso (young socialists) university groups, it was claimed that the configuration of educational policy should no longer be carried out "after closed doors" of the ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, students as principals should be able to express their views as well.
The president of the board of university directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave his support to the students: "We need the student experience," said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the union of education and science (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor to access a later Master's career.
In addition, the federated states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are enough study places for Master with the best possible conditions of study. So reported a GEW member, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education made no comments.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is done practically without control," says the first line of a poem by the lyrical Werner Söllner in disequilibrating language fragments, in which he discusses the experiences of arrival to Germany lived by a dissident, who gained his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book editorial, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literature awards, in 1993 he taught the memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse at Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said he spoke quite a bit last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and disfigured mirror of his files of Security"
Clearly insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted the participation as IM in the Romanian Secret Service Security against fellow German-Roman writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendor.
Together with some of the present in 1989, Söllner had received the German language award.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly in early 1971.
"So I'm someone who didn't defend himself sufficiently in the face of Security's attempts to provoke fear," Söllner concluded.
Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize in literature to Herta Müller and her unmatched literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene is shaken, and especially the community of German authors from Romania for a case that shows the abysses and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, so far known, not only author, but also victim.
In his Security IM Walter file he had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and stressed the influence for him positive from the IM Walter.
He had excused or defended him at all difficult points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, does not surprise so much.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies of the Security-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller already in the month of July in the weekly "Zeit", after having read her own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and will have known in some cases what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and Walter as well.
Unlike the revision of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment with the security control files is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and difficult in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Security (CNSAS) for the Birthler Authority was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files has since been more marked.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of records.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize in literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still quite great. In this interview a former head of the Security of Temesvar spoke despectively of the decoration.
"She has psychosis," at the end she was questioned only once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself without turning around in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as often when there is silent guilt.
Why right now? Who was hurt? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession leaves to hope that the continuation of this story will be more governed by the longings of knowledge and not so much by the award of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in literature, it is more than just a footnote.
The League of Champions as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart's VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the supplier of his team, boarded a Mercedes Class C taxi a quarter hour after midnight, gave the impression that an elegantly dressed outside service member was coming out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the manufacturer of sports items would have distributed samples.
The bald man had hired a driver, because he had not yet known the city.
Moreover, he could also drive the car himself: in the end, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was the 55-year-old man drunk of joy.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow I'd start work again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we have reached the eighth of the end," that is, in the League of Champions, thanks to the triumph 3:1 against Uniera Urziceni of Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves be blinded for success: we will have to brutally fight the descent."
The "greater task" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly revealed again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sort
The eighth final of the League of Champions (on 16/17 and 23/24 February/on 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of Babbel's successor's glittering entrance remained limited.
Not only in the supposed savior, who in a short time had inspired the puzzled professions of Stuttgart self-confidence, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, explained the soul repairer Gross their recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He put out a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, "when a new boost arises in football, sometimes things have not been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a pause of several weeks due to an injury immediately advanced to the best local player thanks to her dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new boss works: "He is a man who intervenes in depth, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what was missing, evidently, when Babbel was.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns the sport manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, players and the administrator also abstained from overestimating the triumph of a weakened defence due to the lack of relief and totally overrun of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had come the sad wake, thought Khedira.
And director Horst Heldt warned that although one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still very far away.
We haven't overcome the problem yet.
That Heldt had no desire to celebrate at his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which re-updated in the form of a television interview, transmitted just before the start of the game, which had been granted by the porter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others, and not Jens, faced Heldt's harsh criticism of Lehmann.
It had reproached weakness in the direction of the board of directors, who had decided to change as a coach because of the pressure of the teenage fanatics.
Also that his day off after the games would have been eliminated Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt said, and announced consequences for the latter.
They probably won't be friends forever, the two forties.
But at least they agreed with all the others that, without the previous efforts with the replacement coach's team, it would not have been possible the show of great force of play and battle.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important participation in success," Heldt and Lehmann said to the unison; and also agreed the man of the plastic suitcase.
World heavyweight championship fight
Hot grief in Bern: again and again Rector Kevin Johnsonn was provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges' judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko is still a world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version won on Friday night to Saturday in Bern to American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko was his third successful defense of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice the world champion of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the nocturnal that everyone had expected could not be accomplished.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give up due to his injuries.
Retractor Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his number 24 fight.
In front of some 17000 spectators in the Berne Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 inches lower, which before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was once and again dodged from the World Champion's blows, so Klitschko was unable to bring his dangerous right to his goal.
In general, passive Johnson did too little for a receptacle, and he just tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the Retractor had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie," who "can't do anything."
In carrying out the weighing, the champion was provoked on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "in order to see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a pause of almost four years, he won at that time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered "his" belt from the WBC, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year later he won in his title defenses to Juan Carlos Gómez, from Cuba, and in September to Chris Areola, from the United States.
In this fight I only received a blow, and I am in very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko his quick return to the ring.
But his dream is still bringing together all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is a world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after it dethroned Nikolai Valujev in November, from 2.13 meters in height.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, for false information on the Kunduz case.
The SPD and leftists demand explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – After the most recent revelations about Kunduz's air attack, the opposition has reproached the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), for knowingly deluded.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast, broadcast by the TV channel ARD, the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister "knowingly had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, they are usually said: he said lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, which Mr Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it had been reported that this attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped trucks but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air strike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left urged the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately to the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel had to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder was part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether the Chancellorship, the army and the information service had approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Künast.
The spokesperson for the government, Ulrich Wilhelm, strongly rejected criticism.
Chancellorship had no influence on the specific actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday they had also raised doubts about the presentation made by the Ministry on the grounds of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially, they had been said to have denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials, they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report from a field patrol.
In the meantime, Wichert would have asked in a letter clarifying the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far he has not received an answer, he said.
The ministry did not manifest itself on Saturday with respect to the complaints made to it, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Onirical worlds
In a state of vigilance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill people and drug addicts do the limits between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens during the sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can deliver ourselves unhindered to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleeplike states during the vigil, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is considered most of the time in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as maniac.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or drug addicts.
Guilt has our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes cause the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality to be blurred out.
Eye-modified alert states can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although the triggers and the effects can be distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen can be referred to similar processes, the psychodelic experiences of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castañeda, the states of chamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations.
The hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain has been derailed – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – and interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts occur very often.
Gravity no longer has power over it
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied the philosophers and doctors since the ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of vigil, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great similarity of the state of madness with the dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the disproposals, assigned formations, and mirroring of it".
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
Its body is two dimensions and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it's floating near the roof of the room.
He's feeling a kick.
Behind him, figures of devils with wings, with red muches like blood, deformed, grinding the teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Strident and malignant voices echo from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult him and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, binds them to form a hanging knot, and fastens them to a hook on the roof.
It climbs up a bowl and puts the knot around the neck.
Jump.
The rope goes loose.
What's the lesson for you? They shout at the voices in a choir that the typhoons give him back, "Go to the clinic and get you healed!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was the LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, it is also manic-depressive, taking medicines, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and deepest despair, he says.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and they fall into a state of overexcitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, disorders in the relationship, or persecution.
Especially widespread is hearing voices: voices that give commands, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the doors to a stream of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, head physician at the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning to it.
At the same time it comes into a passive role, as in a dream, it feels overwhelmed by events and cannot organize them actively.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle as such."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distance of experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still an incognito why our brain makes goats.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality provisionally.
But not all people develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic provision for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that in addition to the genes there are also other determining factors.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neural maturity of the brain is affected in an early stage of development, such as through a viric mother's disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains an unknown how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which is not at all manifested for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience can be the triggers of psychosis when there is already a prior disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain transmitter system.
When the brain warms up
The illogical of all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says the professor in psychology Erich Kasten from Lübeck.
Perceiving hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports about hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreale Welt in unserem Kopf, published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms accompanying psychosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as personality boundary disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and cranioencephalic traumas .
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or uncohibited; when our brain is warm, but also when there is a lack of stimuli.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, evil of love or other brain states of exception.
In jüngeren Studion gabus bis einem Drittel der Befragten ann, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. She was 16 years old, lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attended a high school.
A common girl.
If it weren't for those pictures and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, it happens that a clumsy boy with long, dark hair turns the word to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl's a little queer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she sees and hears that boy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bank next door.
You may even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes she asks if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the other visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When you are in class sometimes you cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains in a visible and audible manner the mathematical equations.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to come, which often comes late and is scarce, you can't tell if you're awake or dreaming, whether the images you see, the mice or the girl with bleeding cuts in arms and legs, appear in front of their open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
Her parents and friends haven't told them anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Fall of 2009. Sarah K. She is today20 years old.
She approved last year selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations have disappeared.
Since you've been in touch over the Internet with psychologist Kasten, you know you're not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a stimulus restriction, it is very likely that after a while he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unoccupied and is responsible for looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., single daughter, was a little scared of the other children and often played by herself.
His hallucinations began when, at 13 years of age, he learned that the man he calls Dad since he uses reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real and noise impressions, those affected like Sarah K. It is difficult for them to distinguish between visions and reality. "Each experience," Kasten says, "takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, so they look so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
Healthy people's hallucinations are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychologically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate his hallucinations as a special skill.
Limit situation between sleep and hallucination
in this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences usually pathologicalize, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic of the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of the art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
The dreamy hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that subsequently cannot differentiate from being awake.
Symptom conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculopathy who experience motor paralysis being fully aware. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with a self-imaginary world that is disapplied by reality.
A form of limited situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an inexhaustible situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into the nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, from Zurich, describes his dreamy experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action to save the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on several days' journeys after an operation of heart valves with heart transplant included, while his body was condemned to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen submerged into a world created by it and visited strange places of other times: he saw himself lying on the bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watching for his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with snow firn and met with a Korean mafia.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these interior travels are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, describes your experience.
On the contrary, mental travel memories are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Lighter and more intensive than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilute the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug consumption show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Each change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Burd
The children will take care of the editorial at 27 years of age
The new editor Kallen has reached a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he commented to SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – The editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at 27 years of age and have the firm will to enter the company, Burda confirmed, aged 69, to SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are trained to do so.
One cannot put his children in front of 7,500 workers, if they are not sufficiently qualified for it.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would retire from January of the Board's presidency and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52, has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he took care of the treasury and thus became responsible for the company's heritage. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over direct marketing, the foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the cover of the editorial.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old. Her son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to "save the differences of 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With the focus on the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family companies are not safe from the decline: "This has always affected families who become infected by the search for capital, who have misjudged and thought that they could rise up as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had "great delusions," Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world league; these businesses have become too big.
Entire beauty
Everything - in the matter of beauty and well-being - you can wish, within reach of your hand.
This is what seems to have been proposed The English Court, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mime of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai - which handles laser hairdressing-; Spagion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which owns a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teapot stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner as you contemplate the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to set up your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities that Spagion offers.
A total of 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, the cavitation to fight cellulitis or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts by introducing your personal key into a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Your director assures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through hairdressing, the Luis & Tachi firm has a room where hair recovery rituals, lightness or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.
Miscellaneous Escorts
Christmas is approaching and it's never time to go through the look of the stars to fit them to our party outfit.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we should consider.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated escort. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The Endesa electric company, together with the Barcelona City Hall, have created the 'Live Office'.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' will define and coordinate the road map for the deployment of the electric car in the city and will achieve arrangements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, it is intended to boost what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the deployment of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities elected by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The Endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
This aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in promoting the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and is active in a series of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT Verde.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the engine sector
The president of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has undertaken during the financial year to support the car sector.
"Without the Automation Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of abandonment, of closing some of our main production plants," said the president of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and to the availability of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automation Plan (IAP), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 ancillary companies, which mobilized an investment of over €3 billion.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to developing new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" of registrations, which grew "40 percent" in November.
20.000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Hall will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the engine mount.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres where there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only classic motorcycles and cars can be found, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find all kinds of items related to the world of the engine.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc. will be found.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic motor that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be: Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, sale of cars; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Cochera Classics, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Skill tests on the outside
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be complemented by parallel activities: holding concentrations, sporting exhibitions, skill testing, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles in a enabled circuit outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sport
Mazda wants to show that sport is not recognized by respect for the environment.
For this reason, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stop and start-up system - which is named i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the petrol 2.0 engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved in its entirety.
Finishes, finishing the vehicle, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving station, we check that the front armchairs present excellent ergonomics and subjection.
Also, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Following with the set formed by the toolboard and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with a large number of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of what the Honda Civic also presents.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, whom everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese has more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
All of this is combined with a large and regular trunk.
The engine stopping and auto-starting system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-litre and 150-horse petrol engine and with the manual six-way change.
This engine is a real delight. It excels by its fineness, by its reduced noise, by its performance and by achieving contented consumptions.
And it is that although the most wanted Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not perform a high number of kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high running comfort and for its contained consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, i.e. the one incorporating a greater number of serial elements.
From the series equipment, especially the rail change assistant (RVM) that eliminates dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, in the absence of any equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which added for 1,500 euros: Bixenon adaptive lamps and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It highlights especially the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the petrol 2.0 engine of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between the €21,770 of the Luxury finish and €23,270 of the proven version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer every day large doses of satisfaction.
'First' luxury
L. A. covers the red sensuality carpet of Penelope Cruz's hand, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever in models as elegant as 'sexys' at the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is harder, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid for, for example, by the iPhone data plan.
In view of the success the company has taken out two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service in exchange for paying six times more for Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's just as limited as your American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is like to have to give up the data when you cross the border or desperately seek a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) in order to check the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and it would have to be in operation for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and a good glasses to read the small letter.
The European Commission's repeated ear tyrons for affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (don't stop being curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of tariffs means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other Internet queries.
No contracts and no gaitas.
It is a connected device and is paid for by buying it, not monthly.
And that's what I hope to see some day with FonPeek, a lifetime-access buying option like Peek already has in the United States.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the first American lady.
If Barack Obama has already gone to take possession of him as president of the United States in a dress and a coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in, no doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has taken a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - greenish yellow with bright reflections - the two times the outfit was composed of three pieces - clothed, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had opted to repeat vestaurio.
But the fabric on which the two costumes are made makes them very different.
If for taking possession of it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a threefold stamped.
The additions have also varied: green heel shoes again, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: a gathered on this occasion, melena looses the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and careers of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey conducted between 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about it: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen limited job opportunities due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of cohabitation in couples and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an out-of-home activity, work part-time, or have an unstable job, begin couples first, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and maternity, and have fewer descendants.
"Women aged between 35 and 49 with fixed work have the first child, average, 3.7 years after commencing cohabitation, an increase of 4.1 women with fixed jobs have required more time from their life path to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of the children.
Moreover, the type of work performed has a great influence on maternity, although less on the timing of the pairing," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they marry and when they have the first rod.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which they marry and at which they have their first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 average, respectively.
"An additional division is established among women according to their level of education.
While those who have elementary studies get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, middle or higher ones invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," Delgado explains.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become an image of different products of the brand, playing the universal motto of 'Because I am worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, thus joins other famous L'Oréal Paris files, such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before it, the last ones to enter such a selected club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male section, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met in the annual delivery of their prizes, held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the date.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's poker
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Póquer de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) some thirty X-rays of writers who have been through their literary life (and, in cases, also through the other).
It does not do so in predictable and fearless genres (biographic similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of the creative character's ignition.
The journey has its excitations and Vicent does not save any scares or enlightenments.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to readings and readings.
I'll give you a few shots here.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, pulsion that I felt without name: the pleasure against the aciago destiny, the unpunished morals and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic mood, without sense, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulyses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must climb up the north wall, from which the best mountaineers are drawn over and over again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a county landlord and others that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the demented cry from a bridge by that character from Munich to bring his echo to the end of the night of the 20th century in its literary form and did it on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day he got on his knees and prayed: 'Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were recorded these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after the weary life pleases death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband usually accepted that she told him that Eduardo VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been a case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness."
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martín-Saintos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja through Faulkner's weapons?
What did Heaven do but absolve that man's fame to serve him as his own pedestal?"
Coward aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by with her and our dog, a copy of mestizo race, rescued from the dog and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, suggested two kicks that left the injured dog.
Our indignation is capital because we did not find the fun in a free aggression to a small, helpless animal, which by the way was tied up.
To this must be added the suffocation that caused a lady to walk quietly and who, when she had these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, because an energy that attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elder or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place at five o'clock in the afternoon of a Tuesday any for a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt it would be useful for much and not generate susceptibility, just clarifying that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
Indignantness has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people to consider it fun to mistreat a helpless animal free of charge that gives us affection, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, mainly among younger drivers, today reported both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, since it is the only protective element capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding on a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, that "it goes beyond designing and manufacturing products each day more secure" and said it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a tire manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop safer products.
Increases the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market starts to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 per cent over 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to the bosses of the manufacturers Anfaf and that of sellers Ganvam.
The good data, not obstinate, should be put in quarantine since the reference to which the comparison was made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the last month's meeting, the enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold together all vehicles that make up the light commercial tailor-made tray: derived from tourism, pick up, vans, light vans and light trucks/chairs.
Also, the nubarrons that most affect their demand have not disappeared, since they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
Thus, the restrictions of the closed tap on bank credits must be added to other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In view of this picture and unlike tourism, aid for the purchase of 2000E has hardly been used.
In addition to individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs who are going to buy a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been testified.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrialists (trucks and buses).
The sales association predicts a 2010 similar to the year ending, for which a drop in sales (of tourism and 4x4) is calculated by 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As happened with ABS brake antilock and will pass with ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, this is already the case in all new-registered light commercial vehicles and tourism, while for the rest a shortage period is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, although it can also help to avoid many collisions by scope.
The emergency brake assistant is to increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver's pedestrian.
But this does not always hold that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the Bosch car component manufacturer, the third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to step on the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum braking system, reducing the distance the car uses to stop.
According to an EU study itself, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one out of every four claims will be avoided with damage to people - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or camera) detects the obstacles and alerts the driver, as well as acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps you increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device shall exert the maximum effort to brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays the plan for Opel until January
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - the 8th likely - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly wants, the new president of GM Europe, is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
However, since GM it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be taken in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but it takes force the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, which is supported by the Russian group Converg.
If there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to China Baic.
The decision to close Saab is maintained at the end of the year if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop his last, and expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took Boxster S as a base and managed to thinn nothing less than 80 kilos, which left the scale in only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, first of all, with the automatic roof that has been filled by one hand-operated canvas, with which they save 21 kilos; using aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, 'caen' other 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they won 7 extra pounds; mounting sports baccquets 12 more and with the light wheels of 19 inches, five.
Finally, renouncing the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door shooters by one of the fabrics, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with the PDK double clutch change, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly on secondary California roads, in mountain sections with really reversed traces
Your behavior can only be described as unattainable.
Weight reduction does not imply that the car does not step on the asphalt with aplom.
Rather, quite the opposite: it had been a long time since we tested a model that was so small and light that, at the same time, it transmitted so much security in the step by curve, even at high speeds.
It is a small athlete, able to heat his muscles in a short march during the time necessary, until we order him to breathe, brake, recover and repress his engine...
What we ask of you, thanks to your address, as communicative as necessary, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with a surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very accomplished and can be boosted with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine's mist, already premiered previously in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from the stop or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads that we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was pretty punished, but the car digested the bags well.
Electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that is that on one of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, well into the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, of the funniest driving that one can in the market and that is something more than just a change of Boxster S.
The car will be put for sale in February 2010, with a price of EUR 70,831.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate of Karl lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the 'maison' shows, the singer protrudes her malot face with as much contruance as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia Wins in Israel · Global Voices
The Caja Labor achieved a brilliant victory for 82-91 in his visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra court, despite the numerous casualties with which Dusko Ivanovic's team counted, and thus is placed in the leadership of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 ratings).
The Victorian team was able to cope with the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work even though it had to suffer to the end to make the victory work.
In addition, the great hit from the perimeter, with 16 triple notes had much to do with the final triumph.
The game started face-to-face for the blues, which were placed from the beginning in front of the marker.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were out of the perimeter already showed that they had jumped to the Israeli court with the hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second room was more than the same, but the team praised Barac's inner game and the work of Eliahu, which was received with pity and applause on the return to which his home was, to continue extending his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter's 'less than six' rating already showed that it wasn't going to be the best Brazilian night.
But the party, even though it was tied to rest, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the victors that in their court no one wins, and with 'Elijah's hand' pressing managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the turning of the 'yellows' to the bright (50-49).
More disadvantages
Ivanovic's people, injured but not less dead, needed to hilarious a couple of games with the right to catch air, and in those arrived Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, which with three triples almost consecutive and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a reassuring income (54-67), which managed to make up the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The seaweeds left their skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what was deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team were not assigned and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by faults, Ivanovic's didn't rush, they defended well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the party already owned and victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent you from fighting the Unicaja
The Unicaja lost sharply in Greece before the Olympics and gave him the leadership of Group B of the Euroliga, in a game marked by the downs of the cashiers, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaysian team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion, nor by the rival entity, perhaps of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first room allowed the Andalusian to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from the Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, led the premises 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja , although the arsenal of the premises in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, they turned the marker 22-20, minute 13, when an action, known as a fight, between the two U.S. bases Beverley and Williams, assumed the disqualification of both players.
The Greek ensemble began to function by showing its superiority within both areas, where the down injury of the English pilot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez were barking the cashiers.
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian fin Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible to mount
The third period was very offensive with the Olympics, which despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even equaled the difference of the meeting disputed in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which caused the group's leadership to be shaken.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last down of the Scottish pilot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconveniences the Uniqueja by Cook's leadership and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when pressing and given its superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian pevot Nikola Vujcic, managed to climb the basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja went off, delivering the leadership to the Olympics.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new Trovit app, the searcher with the largest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and motor in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? Calculates the wages of users from the more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week the application is running, the searcher has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to data available to Trovit from its searchers in the UK and France, Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges EUR 45,226 gross annually and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 who receive a Spanish one.
Similarly, a driver charges 34.247 euros net annual in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid work in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11,592 net annual euros; followed by the dependent one, with 14,725 euros; and the worker, with 15,667.
The most sought-after jobs in the network in the last three months are that of drivers, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets date to Zelaya exit
The Brazilian Government has put an end to Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office shall leave the diplomatic league by 27 January 2010 at the latest when the term of office is formally completed.
Francisco Catunda, head of business at the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globe that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he remains a refugee since 21 September.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, when he has finished his mandate, he has to search for another destination."
The station also quoted the former deputy, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
Following the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya's political asylum which was intended to impose on him by the "de facto" government that chairs Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which the inflation of assets has been the dominant tonic in the markets, again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprised as it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilise markets was to monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving liquidity-free bar to types close to zero for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets are almost complete and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they start to throw some sand into the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premiums.
The volatility of the Stock Exchanges and the differences in corporate bonds have rebounded, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk and the public debt was again affected.
Again, there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, leading to an expansion of the differentials of the eurozone countries over Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision to the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not wrong in trying to silence moral-risk defenders who were once again trying to raise awareness of those responsible for global economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of the credit restriction on the destruction of employment, when what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai's paints a tribal struggle between the Emires to recompose power in the Emirates and the Greek one we've seen before.
A government that conceals public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls out of the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro-member country to break its commitments.
What does make sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within what was expected.
In the Spanish case, as our public debt differentials widen as European corporate bonds do not have to worry.
If European differentials decrease and ours continues to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their scenario up by 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not give much hope of life to their warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudence, driver friend".

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the sub-commission of the Congress of Deputies in which Spain's energy strategy is being debated these days in the next two decades.
After his speech, following that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few brushes of what he had raised in the closed-door subcommission.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 5 billion until 2020 and another EUR 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power plants are kept open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be $60 billion, but up to $95 billion.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that over the next decade investment should not be used to increase capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and in international interconnections
As of 2020, the issue has changed and power needs to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that there is a need for 18,000 new MW, that is, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Law on Sustainable Economy that the Government has just approved is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "point" measures, as the President of Iberdrola called them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be taken as they are already late to mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the 'handling' of Aer Lingus in ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground airport services, Switzerland Swissport, will play the role of Irish airline preferred partner Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports in which it has presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not been transcended, is five years long.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Board and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency in motorways and airports.
Acciona disputes her first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Activaa has been hit by its first concession highway in Australia, a market in which she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at $1.7 billion (about €1.047 million).
The French Bouygues and Sister Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, has become the nearest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a highway builder and dealer.
City City Hall wants to have it ready at the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to move the project forward, in a business plan run by Ernst & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do with the work and exploit the toll.
Pending submission of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to $1.7 billion (€1.047 million) and in the final phase competes for three consortia with a significant presence of European builders.
The group named as Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in liza, and its companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first one is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second one, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Actiona team plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield Infrastructure Manager and the French Bouygues Construction Group.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German builder Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the local also Baulderstone (property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the firm gala specializing in civil works Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it has a clear difficulty in entering if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed Hochtief or Bilbao, in addition to Asian references, and which continues to be an outstanding subject for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% shareholding in Hochtief, which owns the above-mentioned Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Activaa bets by a geographical area of the greatest importance to the sector, in which it has already a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the business of desalation.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for raising and managing the Adelaide desalator, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and operation areas of infrastructure.
The underground toll path, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (northern link), is called to join the western highway of Toowong with the encircling route at Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. It is the greatest action to reduce congestion in the traffic of Brisbane.
The schedule marked by the Administration sets out the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per sense, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute US$ 500 million (€308 million) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruit to Hochtief, who reported yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will provide quick internet access to 400,000 people and give work to German for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has passed the construction project of the 27-storey King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still about to start and Hochtief has closed the sale in 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, you will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia of EUR 64.5 million.
The firm obtains this contract days after the extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) by 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the work is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation period will be extended for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore awards Renfe's publicity
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services over the next two years to Mrs Rushmore for an amount of approximately EUR 3 million per year, the railway operator reported.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that submitted to the competition convened by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of campaigns.
A lot of 63 million to France Télécom for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programmes outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 for hindering its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore a recurring one.
Application Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile subsidiary has followed the wake-up of other operators and has opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The League of Champions has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 473.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth club that more money has won in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue from the major clubs.
So much so, the competition has allocated EUR 5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have been well-stopped from this division.
The white club has been the third on the continent that has made more money to participate, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the late European Cup in 1992 is the fifth of the rankings.
The list is led by the Manchester United and Bayern of Munich, the two teams who also billed more money for participating in the last League of Champions.
And that, despite losing both in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved more money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other country (five for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Layout
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, Michel Platini's president plans to enter 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will devote 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous round of classification (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million only for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each party they dispute.
There are also bonuses for winning (80,000 euros) and evening (40,000 euros for each team). The eight-finalists will receive three million each; the eight-quarter-finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be paid 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 million finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, paid 2.5 million to win the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is of the main, and has four seats assigned.
The previous year's champion remains 40 per cent of the money allocated, 30 per cent for the second, 20 per cent for the third and 10 per cent for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The group New Rumasa degranate yesterday the details of the offer to purchase shares with which it seeks to acquire a top of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force it to issue a public tender for acquisition (opa) for all securities.
In particular, New Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be paid with an interest in this 1% annual postponement
Yesterday Sos' shares closed to EUR 1.85; therefore, New Rumasa's offer values the company 18% below the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerezano Group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of the offer, although the company of Ruiz Mateos claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If achieved, the disbursement would reach $611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is $254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its direction.
In an attempt to stay away from possible offers of purchase and the judicial vavens of their former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
This is a newly created post that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not contentious, as the company continues to be involved in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos reveals new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared yesterday that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
CNMV authorizes the Paternine Exclusion Opa submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion opa submitted by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorises this operation by believing that its terms are in accordance with the current rules and considering the content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading in the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the end of the supply, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the rules in force.
New tools for drilling cars
In these days of temporary accidents, they not only win car workshops.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a sinister are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what will be the cost of repair.
No sinister is the same, and the calculation of the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complicated work.
It calculates the cost of repairing between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including man-made work parts, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the most recent computer tools, it would be a matter of decreases
That's why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Providers of services and solutions for assessing claims and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American Solara group, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with their products.
The other firms competing in the field of sector assessment and information processing tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that manufacturers provide is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, Spain works with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them supplies the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the extent that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new car leaves the market, these companies start working.
It's very hard work, because we have to catalogue each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and introduce their price.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image is made of each model, where different parts of tourism can be "picked".
If it is a fan model, work can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has full information about 99.2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models there is information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the moving park that runs, they exceed 99%.
To carry out documentation work and the development of databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each one specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to use different uses and to offer various products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for managing scrapping parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products that Audatex offers, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that can be provided to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard sinetro rating solution, intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and heavy or light industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint bars.
This tool is paid according to the use, for each rating.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of experiments, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the assembly line only with its base number.
AudaGlass focuses on the moons of the vehicles, and AudaSbastas is an open service to the professional sector on the internet that allows you to climb through the declared vehicles total sinister.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know the deviations by omodel brands.
For example, how many models of a particular brand have passed through the workshop due to damage or how many severe disasters have occurred in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It trades, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for assessing damage, damage or maintenance of the car
The Gt Taxation Guide is its historical reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% annually over the last three years, and in 2008 it billed 10.8 million euros.
Earlier last year, they began their process of internationalization, with the installation of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatax was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global billing of the Solara group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solara group was worth $1 billion in stock exchange, and now its shares are worth $2.4 billion in total.
Since 2007 it has been listed in the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of injured cars
Last October the Solara group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The operation amounted to EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended the next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, waste disposals and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in Germany in 1996 and manages over 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily ads are managed and about 100 new ads are included every day in the Spanish market.
According to Spanish law, a car whose driver's driver's number has been given off cannot be recirculated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as a replacement.
Cars with historical value can be discharged even if they have been given off after some fierce management.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, looking for the replacement, creating budget and generating budget.
