The Prague Stock Exchange at the closing of the market has had a negative collapse.
After the fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
The transactions of the CEZ shares have reached almost half of the daily daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has resumed the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this fall is the collapse of shares on Wall Street.
So, too, we have shown a reaction from the market as a result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the stabilisation plan of the local financial sector.
Share collapse in Asia
On Tuesday the shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indexes, however, during the day they subsequently erased some of the losses.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day cancelled almost 4%, but then also part of the losses stabilized to 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the Chinese stock movement at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, dropped by 3.8% while in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares at the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but eventually the losses stood at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, dropped by 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect the financial markets around the world," observed Hong Kong's chief currency office Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, financial policy is managed by itself, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries will also have consequences.
U.S. shares straddling
The US Parliament on Monday rejected the financial system support plan, for which 700 billion dollars (almost twelve billion Czech kroner) had to be allocated.
The legislators have thus ignored President Bush's appeal to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
The US shares on Monday have experienced a disaster and the main indexes of the shares have recorded the biggest collapse since over a twenty-year period.
The Dow Jones index dropped by almost 7% and a fall of the same size was observed last time in 1987.
The index was lowered before the vote, but as soon as the bill was not approved, it fell free.
The Congress has yielded: the US government can extend 700 billion dollars to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
American legislators broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the American financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (almost twelve billion crowns).
But it's not said yet.
The representatives of the Congress, therefore, have to define some details of the agreement before they publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The support plan of the financial system will be discussed Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
Sunday he told Reuters, the president of the Barney Frank Chamber Banking and Financial Services Committee.
In the Senate, according to some sources, you could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economies, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening financial markets.
Then, however, we will have to come back to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, to reach market aid.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward."
"We have clarified our differing views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilization package," said the democratic Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
The legislators' delegates met the night between Saturday and Sunday with the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson, to give final form to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgages from financial companies, which lead to serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
"We are fulfilling the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market."
"It is necessary to carry on the restoration plan again, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
The Asian Trade Signal
The global financial crisis is heavily on the markets for the stocks that are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement at Congress even before Sunday.
In other words, they want to calm investors before trade in Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence the Monday market as a result of the Congress's decision.
But for now it is not definitely clear when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote on the law and even if negotiations can be arrested at the last moment on some problem.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount expected for system support shall be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush has requested.
But the Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum in case it will have the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next 100 billion dollars and after the end 350.
Bush appreciated the progress in negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, the Congress can overcome its right to veto it.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has remained, i.e. to get the finances to buy the passive mortgage values, whose price has collapsed due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've drawn up everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the Sunday Act and the Monday Senate," mentioned the Republican Senator.
Progress in negotiations is also met by American President Bush.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Bush is satisfied with the positive performance of Saturday and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of golden parachutes
The president of the Banking Committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, the main spokesperson, said that the legislators had agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget for reductions, the division of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called golden parachutes for the managers of the companies participating in the programme and is setting up a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have made a big step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan will count on the aid to the owners of homes that have payment problems.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage rates that it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly expenses on the mortgage rates for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and for what price the problematic assets will be bought
This will be decisive for how losses will be divided between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz website.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"Most importantly, this week the representatives of the Congress have already reached agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this time the most important, "Marek stressed.
Duel to the last blood: MP3 players against cell phones
We will recommend how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
From this it is clear that it is best to buy only the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons for obtaining an autonomous reader.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and on the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy an expensive high quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this reason there is not even an objective reason.
If, however, hard-rock, jazz or blues wines are packed on your shelves, a turntable like this will probably be your dream.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here too, there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for a player 8 thousand crowns, as well as a fan of Pink Floyd may hardly digest the headphones from twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes of which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The decision is the duration of the batteries.
Some high-quality music readers are able to do much more than simply read music, but they don't even make cell phones by mistake.
There is no other current device as universal as your phone.
Along with primary functions, call and send text messages, you can read music and videos, record both and have a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe you can also navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and palm trees you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle that no refrigerator can do the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also leads to disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone and first the indicator on your screen will require the charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few mobile phones are able to read the music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music readers (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As far as economic phones are concerned, they can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, get to work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst last for at least 9 hours with continuous functionality with a charging.
A further problem occurs when you download the music in your mobile phone.
Unfortunately only a limited part of devices has the universal USB port and in addition not all can connect to the computer without special software.
Certainly the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with the music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create themselves a multimedia library ordered by the names of the performers, album names, genres, or user classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cown, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When you choose a particular device you are particularly interested in battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly ease of use.
If the music serves you mainly as a background and if you listen to it every day just briefly on the tram you need a mobile phone that reads MP3.
This now happens, clearly to any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about which phone or reader formats you recognize.
All MP3 players support them, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common ones, the total majority of devices support the music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple company and its iPods).
The best mobile phones also allow you to buy music online, for example.
Just visit, through the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic to buy a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is poor and is usually limited only to hit of the time of the radio.
Prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this very mode of sale of music (either via GSM , internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always take the phone behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to something in his pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
However, it also depends on this, if you always carry the headphones or at least the wireless headphone.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small part of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will, for many, be the price.
The cheaper ones normally cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for the common headphones.
The best cell phones and from the technical point of view more equipped and also with a 3.5 mm socket for the common headphones, cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead, the benefit of readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
Those simplest not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) really do it anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling at one time with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally hitting the start of the mobile internet network and as a result of a giant data transmission ticket.
Which apparatus to use
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an interchangeable memory card slot (e.g. M2, microSD etc.).
Even with regard to the purchase of the card, it is the 2 000 crowns.
But be careful.
The base models only support cards with the maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones do it with 8 GB memory card.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy even a cheap MP3 player, take Cown, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, take the specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual MP3 keys, and the convenience of the service is close to the same MP3 player.
In this area has made more road Sony Ericsson, which phones of the walkman line have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above mentioned brands provide you with the same service and price category up to 4 000 crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in principle up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic since this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services like their partners in Western Europe.
However, there is something missing – a virtual operator that obliges traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be missing for long.
As the Czech operators belong to the most dear ones in Europe, we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
In the end ČTú also confirmed that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regularising roaming rates, perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of mobile operators in the Czech Republic SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic be kept so high against Europe?
The answer is simple, lacks the competition that would really like to start the fight .
Perhaps it sounds absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and covering highly above 100 %.
Instead, mobile telephony operators like to launder the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the chief of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTú) , Pavel Dvořák, who in the past has said that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network has no longer likely many possibilities. (However, it might be difficult to find other frequencies now).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a considerable drop in prices, to which traditional operators would then have to react.
At the same time even before the entrance of sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile in the market, similar voices were heard in Britain as we did.
However, it has been shown that there is a place for operators like this and that they can really succeed.
Finally, for examples, we must not go too far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the Virtual Operator Mobilking in Poland.
In only half a year this operator has managed to conquer more than 100,000 customers and to become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group to which the Czech Republic belongs, among other things, U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to actually function, it is enough for many less customers than a traditional operator.
They do not lead to relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the offer of the services most restricted
So for example Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS that cost at least half of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move, even the bet on a bet-group not very soon.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"Real men choose Mobilking operator that they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can also affirm a similar concept as in Poland.
The press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition from the point of view of the services it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no possibility, mobile network operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there is ever an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic do not have many expectations.
Mobilking's ignition will rather happen in the other countries of our area," he said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesman of the Penta Financial Group.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that current operators in the Czech Republic are not very much in favour of this thought.
Rather, they try to do everything because they do not create any potential competitors.
For some time now, he has not hidden his interest in the launch of a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefonika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And first you get better is.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all the Czech mobile network operators.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them," says the spokesperson of the Pavel Kaidl group.
So maybe better times will come.
From unofficial information it appears that the first virtual operator will have to have it by the end of the year.
But for now around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for creating a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has turned to us," he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň of the Press Section of Telefonika O2.
The specific nature of the Czech market also applies to other operators.
The press spokesman for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová added in a rare agreement with the O2 declaration: "For now we have not noticed any vital and advantageous commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build".
And he adds: "On the T-Mobile network a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this point we must already have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon."
Vodafone concentrates his attention rather than achieving his applications for the 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the context of the sharing of expenditure and infrastructure.
Let us consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
The competent authorities - with the complicit operators
The attitude of mobile telephony operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices, thereby reducing profits.
Why, then, facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The discomforts around the creation U:fon testify that when operators hold to something they know how to row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure imposed on ČTÚ during the creation period of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This testifies to public access information from the ČTú web pages.
But right now U:fon serves as a topic for which you do not accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The competitive environment of the mobile telephony market has been poorly enhanced in addition with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would focus on him and above all on his high-ranking services."
However, the attitude of mobile operators is quite surprising the complete lack of interest on the part of the Czech regulatory bodies.
It is not only the attitude of ČTÚ that unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in the economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, this with regard to the whole problem has taken its typical position.
"The virtual operator's entry into the mobile telephony market would be possible after the conclusion of the rental contract of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator had been completed.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa, Section for External Relations UOHS, in response to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators may not be surprising.
On the other hand, the office which needs to defend the interests of consumers and, above all, to take care of the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market is more than a delicate deal.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside where virtual operators commonly work, we can observe that their market entry has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
But of course the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to UOHS’ interests.
Truly shocking throughout the situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is on its own.
Equally as the same price of petrol for all petrol is certainly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section found no sign of anti-competitive behaviour regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it has no corresponding responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The necessary tools for the opening up of the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be lacking by the telecommunications regulator," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points .
Of course there is an analysis of the relevant markets drawn up by ČTú, according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of economic competition the only market.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator the agreement of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator has - at the end of the accounts logically - the monopoly of his network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not accept this argument, for UOHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators do so oddly similar.
At the same time, complaints from stakeholders (including the aforementioned GTS Novera company) show that during negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to ČTÚ in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which UOHS is kept out of the way.
We have already found this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of ČTú's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved telecommunications law was updated, despite the fact that many experts expected the situation to improve.
This is something UOHS representatives need to know more than good, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it, when no one's watching
While we do not realize that these pseudo-virtual operators still operate, some of them even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own price lists of mobile telephone services which are only partially public.
These are usually multilevel marketing companies.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the persons pre-established.
Magic is the fact that the company against the operator figures as a classic company customer, which orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a pre-sale.
"If the cases you are discussing, of which we will be interested, could be a breach of the contractual conditions, and could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with this company," replied Martina Kemrová.
But it is unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of the persons responsible for mobile telephone operators.
Especially in the case of the 3 companies mentioned, there can be thousands of customers.
No operator at the same time defends himself from such an attitude.
From the activities of these companies they bring a non-differentiating profit and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they are not harmed in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not registered on their behalf, so they cannot fully dispose of it as the usual customers of mobile phone operators "
But this should be a little bit weird at ČTú.
In addition, another issue is being raised for UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has rights strong enough to expose similar activities and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanation of operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer expensive
As the text has already been mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile telephony market has led to a significant reduction in prices for services.
At the same time practically in all the countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The topics they used were practically identical - too small market, too saturated limit, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in the developed countries in these cases, the regulatory bodies have intervened in defence, not of mobile operators but of their customers.
Both with the formal measures and with the non-formal pressure, then came to the creation of the first virtual operator and he joined others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators launch the whole case from one to the other as a boiling potato.
From our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of competence in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But let's not throw away the sponge.
If the information of the backstage is right and the virtual operator will really appear from us, the Czech mobile phone market will get back in motion.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only hardly UOHS could remain impossible to the refusal (discrimination) of the other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the day of recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn manner the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov mëj".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the national theatre orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, choir step and instrumental edition.
The song is under the direction of Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem's revisions are Otakar Jeremias and Jaroslav Krček.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already before he told the radio "Český rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to take care that both and even the choir, have a clear saying, that the text is well understandable, that it is in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate next year the 175th anniversary.
The song "Kde domov męj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divad it in the original work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
He has acquired popularity and people have spontaneously made it his own.
The first stanza of the song after the founding of the Czechoslovakia of 1918 became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem plays
On Wednesday MHD Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which on the metro, tram and buses will go up the first passengers who, instead of the paper ticket, will have an electronic card in their pocket.
At the moment you can get about 100,000 people who own your Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day and 90-day-year-old card (which will run from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have their own paper recharged in the Infopoints and in the offices of the Transport Company and at the Muzeum metro station, Mëstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The sizes can be bought from yesterday on the Internet on the page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service took advantage of more than four hundred customers before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the Internet service can completely forget the doors in the subway stops where so far they had to make long files for paper tickets.
The cutting is purchased via the internet and on Opencard they charge it to one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places passengers have a portal with trained staff that will help those interested in buying on the internet and will also record on their card the purchased credit." said the spokesperson of the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries it will be possible to load electronic cuttings on the Opencards in ATMs and selfservices that are installed at the entrances of the meter.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, look like ticket obligators and passengers have already noticed them at the stops of the Roztyly Metro, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská Metro.
"There are now five in the whole city but there should be eighty by the end of the year," Opatrný concluded.
The cut will be controlled instead of by the ATM driver.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just enter the Opencard card card and after payment of the cutting, it will be loaded above.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from the number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the additional trains in the integrated transport of Prague there are controllers equipped with card readers with which they verify the temporal and zonal validity," explained the way of controlling Filip tickets by the Ropid organisation, which sets up the times of the collective transport of Prague.
Urban buses have the readers of the cards integrated into the driver’s case.
During the ascent it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at the point determined next to the box.
So the driver checks the validity of the loaded cutters.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded cutters, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take urban buses and will not remember, when the cut-off expires, can again go to the self-service ATMs, where they load the cutters on the paper.
This will display the information on the validity of their documents on the device screen.
Germans in the Sudets wanted a referendum from the USA.
The Germans of the Sudetians in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This is from the letter deposited in the scientific library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States at least.
With this desire, according to what is said, some groups of Swedes Germans spoke in 1945 to the president of the United States.
This is also the result of the letter stored in a private archive and now deposited in the scientific library of South Bohemia.
Germans at Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "District of Šumava" – occupied by Hitler on the basis of the agreement of Monaco – to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises for which American units arrive in German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," writes the letter signed with the words "People who hold to the fate of Šumava with all their heart."
Because, they say, attachment to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives Germans hope only to brutality, lack of concerns, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to assume the protectorate on Šumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without respect for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, You would recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has contributed for nothing, for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," writes the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst for revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the USA had to doubt the belief of the Germans in Šumava , it would be enough to organize a referendum in the district on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the USA or to live under the control of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the then Swedish Germans.
Even though the Czech Germans had to understand that it would be their move from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the peoples of the Sudes.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as German of Budějovice in the sea power of the Baltic Sea.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and put in the prison camp in Holštýn, the dozens of other Czech Germans went to find him so that he could teach him the Czech.
"These people believed that once the Czech came home, it would have made him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, lived in Czechoslovakia the prime of war, he believed that on the basis of the Beneš decrees they would be moved from the Republic.
You won't pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the autists
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could also be defined as the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to leave on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš שebíček, expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet as well as on the flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol on the steering wheel.
And remind him to put his belt on before he left.
He wants to touch in the conscience especially young drivers, motocyclists, pedestrians and not lastly professional drivers.
What's going to happen in the spot?
Especially stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this also testifies to the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You won't pay!
The word "do not think" is capitalised on the plate.
And in a pool of blood there's the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his own life.
The spots "will scare" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images of the victims of accidents can commonly be seen with dramatic scenes.
It is thus promised to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Carrot and stick to drivers
"With drivers, the carrot and stick system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or the accident.
We must remember the risk to the drivers," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of Na Homolce Hospital.
And so it takes information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, believes the psychologist.
According to him, the panels that alert the danger drivers are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel warning of danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and the drivers will no longer pay attention to it," Kořán warns.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of the Interim Israeli Government Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the return of almost all the territories occupied in 1967, that is, also the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the heights of Golan, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue that he published Monday, the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all areas (occupied), if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"We will have a certain percentage of these territories but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the possible return would also include East Jerusalem .
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all doesn't want the raspberries or planners to pass on to him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the light of the two attacks of July in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of wounded people.
According to the prime minister you will need to find "a particular solution for the Mountain of the temple, the sacred and historical places," which are within the Old City. .
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he also stressed.
The withdrawal from the heights of Golan
Olmert has also spoken of Israel's withdrawal from Golan's heights, that is to say, the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get Golan's heights.
They will have to give up the current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (the movement of the Shi'ites); they will have to give up the permanent support, which they offer to Hamas' terrorism, (the Shi'ites' movement) of Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions after the accident: Are the bus drivers illegal?
The law does not recognize them, you cannot walk on the long distance bus
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the bus company Student Agency came out the question whether the drivers and passengers could move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to comply with the laws severely and formally, the steward's activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The incident last week with which a 22-year-old hostess lost her life was caused by a truck that cut off the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver on the safer place of the bus, although there were still two other seats assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or brake sharply even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether the bus is equipped with standing places according to the traffic booklet.
If passengers are not approved, they shall be seated.
Student Agency buses did not stand, confirmed it at Aktuáln the director of Radim Jančura.
"We assessed this with the Ministry and at first did not allow the passenger movement on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned place," he expressed his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role."
However, no regulation prohibits the transporter from carrying out the services.
The law of road traffic recognizes only the term accompanying the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," says Speaker Hanzelka less clearly.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law cures this problem sufficiently.
It depends on whether the bus has approved standing places.
Everything there," he says.
Categorizes buses in urban areas where there are the standing places and the maximum speed limited, interurban with standing places with higher maximum speed and long traffic without the standing places with the maximum allowed speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As on a plane, says the expert.
The expert BESIP on road safety Jaroslav Hořín does not find the fundamental problem in the steering movement on board the bus.
"During a quiet race there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the air service.
It is not even safe when a turbulence arrives and the flight attendant can smash his head."
"If the bus does a sudden braking, of course, the laws of physics are valid.
Same as in the urban bus or on the tram.
The carrier company must resolve the safety of the frontals by means of an internal regulation," he said and also intends that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport company offering the services of the stewardess..
This takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director considers their job dangerous.
"As soon as I have the feeling of having to consider the steward's profession as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they leave.
They would also reduce expenses," he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency, has motivated the absence of stewardess on his means as an interest in security.
"We don't have hostess, we're already opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident," said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has taken place.
A young hostess of the Plzeň region, who had worked for the company for two years, died in the accident of the line for Naples.
A Slovenian truck probably got out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with a sharp maneuver, but hit it with the front right.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the Stewarts were occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in long-distance buses, they are unacceptable."
The company intends to report the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the court’s judgment to pay the damage to the girl’s family, but expects a financial compensation from the offender.
The revision of the law?
Not in view
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to a clarification of the Stewart movement on board buses.
"But they have achieved no concrete result.
They are not considered by the bus, they are more concerned with the scoring system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone during the driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the Stewarts as a major threat to the safety of passengers," concludes spokesperson Havelka, who is responsible for the control of the safety of buses by the police and the security offices.
The hopes of Düsseldorf point to Frankfurt
There are no missing words in the letter from the director of WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that could form "the capital market centre of the financial group of savings banks" through the unit meeting of the Düsseldorf bank with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
The West LB would launch a "competent block" with lasting profits in such an enterprise.
Moreover, such a union could be a decisive boost for further links in the Länder's banking sector.
So it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Since WestLB is still under strong pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, having pointed out to the North Rhine-Westphalia regional government some time ago that time is constraining the search for a future solution.
Links between the Deka-Bank, that the same customers of the Savings Fund because of their investment funds already know, and the WestLB is certainly already talking about it for quite a while, even by Frankfurt.
He reported at the end of August the head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas at the time of the presentation of the first half of the year that a merger of the house at Via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the CEO of the Deka, who half of which is brought by regional banks and savings banks, has delegated the Board of Directors to conduct discussions with the West LB on joint contracts.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
But the conversations have, as they say in the business square, just started.
Della Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the most important in the business square in Frankfurt, it is not mentioned the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings sector.
In 2003, for a short period, Deka-Bank seemed to be able to merge with the regional bank of Rhine-Palatinate and Helaba.
There was nothing about this three-way association.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Asia was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank of the Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always thought of us for a merger of the Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end Günther Merl, president of Helaba's governing board, spoke against design games to meet with his home.
Apart from this, it seems that cognition is created, that the different houses of the public sector need to be brought closer.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, there could be a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of the Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba it's not entirely good news.
If it increases the pressure for other mergers, the partners will be missing.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although he has so far overcome the financial crisis much better than houses in Monaco and Stuttgart.
The association of the savings banks Assia-Turingia, which participates with 85 percent of Helaba, put the chain at the meeting with WestLB.
Only the NorthLB would remain
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual houses are dealt with.
In June Merl pointed out that the decisive question, with which business model the future of regional banks would be assured, would not yet be answered by the association of German savings banks.
In the end, the division of the West LB could also come out, which, of course, is not wanted.
The letter from the Board of Directors thus expresses the desire to aspire to a "general solution" in any case.
You will see how the reunification of the individual parts will work with the Deka-Bank.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it's the first time while for Luca it's the third or the fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them next to the barrel of 5l. of the brand Kaiser stands a massive bearded and demonstrates to about 200 travellers what are the deep tones that can produce from the throat.
Elena first gave Luca a pack and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, depart this evening at 23.45 four couriers with destination Monaco, Beer Party" , arrival scheduled at 6.30.
Three couriers are mainly reserved for Italians, on another trip only Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so noisy, says Marco, that it's not something for the Italians.
Mark that carries a long coat with false fur lining and a pair of glasses with silvered wide sticks belong to him buses.
For 5 years they've been going to Oktoberfest, this year they're 3 tours.
The night trip, the day at the party, returns at 22,30.
Nighttime would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euros includes the journey, the welcome of the toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to the rules of genuine Bavarianness, the sickness box and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave at Brenner's.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better that way, they'll still need their strength.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian plates on the A9 motorway before Monaco take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco's group arrives at 6.30 am at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others come together, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Knowledge.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tendon means to run!", Marco quotes in the early morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, but we're stuck, and not all the yellow hats sitting on the same benches, split into the space!"
The mouthpiece costs 8.25 Euro, screams Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
"Demonstrate to the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they disappear!"
Third: "This evening at 22,30 on time we meet again here! Understand?"
He's leaving for the party.
On the street one attacks as follows yellow berets to trees, road signs and even a billboard of advertising from a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as "the end of the week of the Italians".
Exact data do not exist, we speak of 50,000, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is argued that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police of Monaco is reinforced with 7 agents of South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian red cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where Italians are first with 200 medical care in front of the English (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the trend of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed the finance minister Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the politician has used the word "relative" and has also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared by critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate financier Hypo Real Estate, noted in DAX, gets a billion-dollar credit from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
An expert in the situation told Reuters Monday, support credits would reach up to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest for the requested party.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
The losses of the Deffa affiliate are at the bottom.
The State financier according to a newspaper article has been refinanced in the very short term – which is no longer possible because of the distrust on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves had decreased by 95% of the Euro 2.37 million, even the share of its own capital had declined from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs fell to 0 compared to last year, profits from both increases of both applications and certain shares as to the liquidation of provisions on loans fell more than 70% of the 5 million Euros.
Only because of higher incomes from the refund of subordinate compensation costs that come from both the restructuring of the former Defa Group and the reimbursement of interest according to the single text of tax laws and business management for business consortia, the negative profit has been fairly moderate with about 16%.
The former public financier after being privatised in 1990 had been lost in speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were disbursed in the Aareal Bank.
Since the income in the classic state financing was too low, the Depfa has committed more to infrastructure projects and to the financing of joint projects of private and state investors ( PPPs) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate must now amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the profit and loss account of the group.
The fact is the dividends have been deleted.
Already in 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of the Depfa is an important financier of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on market refinancing between banks compared to other institutions because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of loans between banks largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Real Estate Hypo requires for a part of the Depfa's credit portfolio – about 50 ml. – in the short term the means of refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate notice, the group's financial needs were covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected from the influence of international monetary markets for the most non-functioning.
Other sources feel that, thanks to the money, the refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the HRE Georg Funke Steering Committee said, on the contrary, that the HRE Group will not need monetary markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Service (BaFin) are based on the fact that the HRE Group's businessability is still assured.
This is expected for the bank's shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and the impact of the crisis there will be no guarantee.
Funding may not be fully used.
But the opposite is not to be excluded.
After Sunday night the bank learned what it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm down the souls.
The share rate falls 75% on 3.30 Euros.
Loan courses are pretty good.
While prior-debts are almost unmovable, they give in to delayed credit courses.
The loans of the Württemberg-Hypo affiliate are mainly due to be understood as the expiring events beyond 2009.
Before HRE loans seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of banks and the institution itself, that the crisis has occurred with the emphasis of the Depfa, must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Except when the central banks, governments and the less damaged banks are still ready, we can count on an amortisation of the annualities by the deadline.
Or it comes into effect, which nobody ventures to hope for – that the financial crisis will be overrun within the next 15 months.
But it concerns the information released because of partial stateizations the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
In particular, it will create some sleepy nights for long-term investors if they break up with their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the carry-over of losses for future payments of the compensatory tax on capital gains.
Sylvana and the Bento-Box secrets
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, the first day of the school should show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls begin to ridicule: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new trading log tells of Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I also had a hard time going to school.
I dress at the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
The road had to be on my own, and fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the first hour of lesson does not seem to have been fixed as we have in Lower Saxony.
Schoolchildren arrive slowly from 8 onwards, until 8.40 a.m. starts a brief conversation with the professor, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who speaks freely in front of the people, in addition to a class of 40 schoolchildren.
Since I had not yet the school uniform, I put on an old skirt of the host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed so I stood in front of the chair and tried to say well: "Soyonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that point, I was very happy that I had already begun to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have whispered, ridiculed and made a sign and I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew this from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "sweet, sweet."
Then I ran fast in my place.
The girl next to me rang, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the class time was still quiet, but when he played the gong, I was assailed in the true sense of the word.
Everything spoke disorderly and ridiculed and dried up with questions – then it's really hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
In the break they all opened their Benedict.
My host mother also made me the basket for the Lunch- is different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, salad of cucumber and algae, fruit and a kind of wrap with meat and tofu..
To tell the truth, I don't even know exactly what I eat in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new taste.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under the salt, Brrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a Benefit made by herself, prepared quite artisticly, with the hope then to make the acquaintance of the boy during recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm just curious if you can find out.
"Why exactly Japan?" they asked my friends when I told them, that I would have wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I always said,
"Why I'm fascinated"
Finally, I have been reading the Mangas for years with fervor.
And to better understand the comics and culture that they contain, sooner or later I started learning the Japanese language.
I was completely convinced to come here once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They hold us here a lot.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and latest trends - on the other hand: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is organized well, I've never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroache escape when they feel the danger.
The neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it be seen if, when they behave in the same way, they have our same feelings?
Newspaper "Edge" has been published for some years by well-known scientists.
6. ONLINE SPIEGEL in a series presents chosen answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of conscience, without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to the other species and ask questions about feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter an impracticable territory, because the base of reference does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that the other animals do. That means it pretends to be dead, run away or attack.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often linked to human awareness, associated circuits (this for its direct sharing with short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this wide area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on the prefrontal bark, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the basis is thus admitted on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic particularity should be presented in the way of talking about man: since a large part of life is related to language, it is often said to be related to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the awareness of the animal, as it is done, surely differs greatly from the circumstances of our conscience.
That is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through its experience due to special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of the conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of the consciousness to which science would be easier to access.
The processes of animal consciousness could be analyzed without regard to their contents, and this is the case in the short memory studies of primates, in particular in the example of visualization.
Therefore, for this principle, which Christof Koch und Francis Crick follow, goes first to the neural correlations of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
In an interesting way, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal bark for the implementation of the display.
What, then, is described by the feelings?
I charge them with the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of their conscious brain activities.
What we indicate as "fear" is therefore the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the memory of work.
In this way the feelings are closely connected to the regions of the bark, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
Speaking nature creates subtle nuances of hearing, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Compared to this Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that the feelings result from more primitive activities in the regions of the body of the sensations of the bark and the scalpel, similar to Jack Pankseep, who however concentrated more on paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could be part of the feelings extended to the species .
At a purely theoretical level I cannot contradict it, but I think it is unspeakable.
Pankseep provides arguments about the fact that what appears to rats and humans as fear, is likely to be felt with the senses in both cases: but in what way could it happen, if rats and human beings experience the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
Does a cockroache in case of danger run away as if he also felt the fear?
In my eyes the mere resemblance of behavior cannot yet prove any vital resemblance.
And that is, neural confrontation continues to be of help: rats and human beings have similar paleoencephals, scarabs not even a brain.
But is paleoencephal responsible for feelings?
And even if we could prove it to humans, how would we want to prove it on rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress here at the neural level, provided that the same procedure on rats and men is waived.
Because I don't do language research and conscience research in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This can be considered as shortsighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than slamming continuously against a wall.
I'm, of course, a practical emotional.
The President of the UEFA Platinums: referral to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europe with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries"
Both the host countries zoppiche in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stages to be used by the Europeans will even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we must work with the highest speed," said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"the UEFA will keep an eye on us"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the leadership of the Polish PZPN association was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish information agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platinum that the preparation for EM 2012 will not suffer from it."
Many exponents of the first division were condemned for manipulation only last season, and in the end it was even necessary to postpone the beginning of the League at the last moment.
Dennis Quaid goes mad.
He wanted to promote a new film, he talked about the private, and now he's got grain with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared his former Dennis Quaid adultery.
He foams out of anger and goes back.
The Roses War in Delay for the former couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors are now arguing with each other a bad fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time expressed himself about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this has been very painful."
The scope of the traditions she would have come to know only after the separation.
The opportunity for the "to strip the soul" was the work with Ryan's press for his new film "The Women" – the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his being publicly declared as an adulteress husband was clear to disengage: it would be "unheard", said the 50th to the "New York Daily News", that "Meg for the next time repeats and reworks the story of our relationship".
It would also be "deplorable" that to Jack, the sixteen-year-old son who had together, again "there are publicly reminded of the pain and subvertment, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan lives on her own, Quaid is married again and will soon become a father of twins.
And therefore his judgments end with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I find myself lucky to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best."
Travel prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in the hotel have become more convenient again - this is the result of a study by the financial supplier and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of the year of 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter observed a clear decrease in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March prices rise in 41 of the 48 European cities examined on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3,6 % lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year before.
The American Express sees as a reason for this the weak dollar quote, which would lead to a "calante desire to travel by American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession of hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city the prices of hotels with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
In terms of flight prices, the trend in the first quarter still stands as follows:
Due to the rise in kerosene, passengers in the Economy Class had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, long-range fuel flights would be up to 29.2% more expensive.
From April to June the prices of Economy Class air tickets fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, in the first class and in Business the price changes were much weaker.
In Germany prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11,9 %, in the second quarter they fell by 23,6 %.
As for the German domestic flights according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the collapse of prices would be low economic growth on the one hand, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market has crumbled.
On the other hand, there would be an agreement on open skies, which liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe, an increased pressure on competition.
A sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of non-profit routes at the Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared failure – only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburg'sSV becomes a capitolist.
The Borussian Luhukay still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the landing of luck for the national player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player first entered the game late and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was formulated with precision, passing it on his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the hall of the Hamburg arena cabins.
It had not happened much in the catacombs, the game break was over and most of it sat back in its place.
Rieger has been HSV's physiotherapist for almost 3 decades, enjoys an even greater estimate than certain old players.
And so his warning also found listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol drowned and raised his thumb as a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the coach-in-chief of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here is the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
"Today not everything was nice to see," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have "wanted more relaxed".
For the 1st to zero Hamburg must thank the head shot led by Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that many weak players in Gladbach have not been able to hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg this Monday will be 121 years old.
The spectators celebrated earlier, in the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing classification on the screen, which legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We're able to put it all right," said Marcell Jansen.
It submits that the provisional certificate from the table is more indicative of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the petric door as well as Jansen breathed at the Bayern FC – finds itself slowly, but has not yet been able to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," Jol relaunches.
After the vote was defeated

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einsteins' general theory of relativity might not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that freeze rapidly, death by freezing now falls on you.
Among the scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates a mess – the anomaly of Swing-by
Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they get additional thrust/spin/scrolling in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American search probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical expedition as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What has surprised scholars for years now: rockets do not behave completely as they would expect under the law on gravity.
In fact, you get to irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far Physicians have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter with a curvature of space, might not be entirely accurate.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes that before Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain Swing-by's anomaly through the so-called dark matter that astronomers have seen in the cosmos.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be the dark matter that might even be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Of the existence of dark matter, space scientists have only known about 10 years.
From her there is evidently an attraction force, whose effect on the other celestial bodies is shown.
She herself is completely invisible, that is, she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation of sort, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter is at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
Sudanese kidnappers had requested several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before release 6 kidnappers were killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The redemption negotiations are already under way.
Germans are always in the sight of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in Sahara are certainly free.
This has coincided with Egyptian state television, Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released
We are examining their health," said Frattini.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of a desert expedition are already on the way to Cairo.
It remains still unclear the background of a shooting that took place before the hostages were released: therefore the kidnappers after the instructions of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them in surprise.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It would still be "just trying to take the hostages in hand", when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had killed 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers claimed from Germany a ransom of EUR 6 million; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" referred to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would have delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release women in hostages after the ransom was paid.
Men would have to be held until the kidnappers had had a secure escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report .
The abuse of the patriarch "brought suicide"
Years of abuse by the patriarch led a woman to kill herself, declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stitians, Cornwall, was in prison for 6 years after he had admitted eight cases of sexual assault.
Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly harassed his daughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a note of the confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Miss Randle had been killed in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a girl and lived in Coventry, Trerise harassed her and bandaged her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
Her daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Public Ministry Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead" and had "thirty with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
You think you killed yourself suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I tied her up and bandaged her."
"I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "He is an extremely strange fetishist, and for his victim it must have been terrifying, especially when he was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim who takes away his life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn't, it would have been difficult for the facts to be finished before the court."
I know the effects Stephanie's father and mother have had on their daughter these years.
"Otherwise she was clearly likely a promising and happy young man of success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Office officer who left the top secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the Office of Secrets Act, has learned the BBC.
The man was in transfer from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is the least delicate of the charges made under this law and there is nothing that suggests a criminal intent.
BBC Frank Gardner's defense correspondent said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They would have thought that this was treated internally to the Mod and the Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be accused by the metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The lost documents contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden place.
Construction companies face the B&B account
British construction companies could face an account of over £80,000 after the Bradford & Bingley bank was rescued.
The government gave 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all the companies that take the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" that companies and their members have to pay.
The 14 billion-pound loan will eventually be repaid when the Bradford & Bingley loans will be redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid every year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits, but the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged every year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have acted prudently are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million pounds to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the construction company association, told the BBC that he thinks he's unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have acted prudently in the recovery market are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We need to examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a significant account," added Mr Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since the construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
The milk goes up to 5 pence per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of its milk for an extra of five penny per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two penny in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide for themselves whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the increase in February, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Security denied to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court refused a bailout request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that you could be arrested when you return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him a bailout for extracting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of many charges of corruption against you.
The long-standing political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh of Sheikh Hasina is expected for the coming weeks but its party, Awami League, has asked that the temporary government of the country supported by the military give it first total freedom.
Correspondents say that while you were going abroad for medical attention on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of your release, if you can remain free when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will call the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The High Court has refused the bail request for Sheikh Hasina by implying that you cannot have the security since you are already abroad on the word for medical care," says his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall make an appeal against the High Court's order."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
He expected to return to Sheikh Hasina after 17 October, said a senior leader of the Awami League party on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the government flanked the military force took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical care.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear for the Afghan anti-polio campaign
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, says the United Nations.
The UN carried out a programme of vaccinations in six provinces last week.
But it is said that you cannot reach children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesperson said that this happened despite the Taliban's promises that they would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the decision of the Competition Commission to force the company to reduce its participation in the rival TV station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the competition appeal court to cut its shares on ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation hindered the competition and allowed unjust influence on ITV.
BSkyB purchased participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB participation in ITV sows doubts about the independence of ITV, making the Competition Commission launch an investigation.
Virgin's head, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - specifically as BSkyB had said it would raise it voting rights.
New investigation into the case of the US prosecutor
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Prosecutor to examine the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation took place when a case report by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticises the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical to the White House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by the fear that the prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special Minister Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to hinder justice.
"Series of charges concerning potentially criminal behaviour have not been fully investigated or verified," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said lawyers had been fired for failing performance.
But later it appeared that the lawyers who had been dismissed had not been assessed more than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by the policy.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in judicial action against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the accusation of fraud against democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute cases in court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for the dismissals, and finally he reassessed his position.
A number of other officers in the Justice Department fired themselves.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical about Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had primary responsibility for dismissals, which had abdicated to his role as leader and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officers, including Bush Karl Rove's previous senior assistant, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigations.
The epic of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honoured at the Q Awards for its epic Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at the ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to gain recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the record of the 1977 album hit by Meat Loaf.
The Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year's prizes, being in the list of candidates in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the magazine Q, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by Meat Loaf.
It was opened with an instrument section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was realized as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached the 15th place.
But Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell's album remained almost nine years in class and was able to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapse on stage.
In 2007, acute larynx forced him to cancel the concerts.
Later it emerged that it had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, roads and other crossings, some famous, others merely used.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and residents for a long time find it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, especially because they have never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without doing the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 in length, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active trafficked road.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlante.
The road, however, must have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include long-standing neighbors who say that they were hit by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remains of the gentleman's neighborhood of the past.
But the department of preservation and development of the city, which has control of the roads, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Committee for the Use of Land of the Municipality Committee of the District some representatives of the agency of the city and Avalon Bay have drawn up a proposal for the real estate company to buy the streets.
But the committee prefers the road to stay in the hands of the city, and has requested a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the director of Community Board 3 district.
"There is very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There could be proposals to fix it and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay many months ago announced that he wanted to reopen the small road and install seating places, including some to use for a coffee at which the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the road was made public for the first time at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renew this crooked alley and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a Preservation Speaker Accommodation, said that in fact it was the desire of the city to sell the road and pointed out that the purpose of the agency was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a light historical footprint.
Some believe that it was named in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps better known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The land was splendid," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, garments and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write "gentrification" of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, implying that the public property piece, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a city fragment almost for almost nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jérémieh Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Little Nostalgic Look at the Extinguishing City"), published part of a City History Speech that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow road without exiting, dark even by day and delimited doors of rusty iron warehouses and windows with sarcasms, with old newspapers of weeks flowing along the bottoms."
With few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat was running fast through the back of the road near a door leading inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic dress shop.
On the walls there were graffiti and a bottle of 22 ounce empty beer lying near a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
A few passers-bys have said that they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest that they would need to be a little embellished.
Mr Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks some people underestimate the attractiveness of the road in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty and disgusting places."
Bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this educational point, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member in California studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not good how you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
It is a complicated business to really attract Spanish voters.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that, "African-American and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English students.
Yet, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in language classes other than English, does not take into account his interest in filling learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the eastern county of Los Angeles.
The school's students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But among the fourth grade students, a surprising 100 percent of the students did the higher-level test in the 2008 math status exam.
An equally surprising 93% of the fourth-graders did the expert-level test on English-language art.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama's favorite one.
Sixth Street emphasizes rest and exercise, constant assessment of skills and an "no excuse" attitude.
Furthermore, and it is here that Mr. Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, Director of Sixth Street, the obstructive approach of the school for English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We had a fantastic success with a student just from Mexico and if you had joined the 12 month class after you would not have been able to identify what it was."
"It works," he observed, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate it in other schools by a majority in Spain and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that very easy question, but education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own continuing support for bilingual education prevent Mr. Obama's response.
While he agreed that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the subject trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about "only-English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these shortcomings of achievement, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise them or trivialize them.
Oil is falling sharply and the economic fear is renewed
Oil prices have fallen sharply on Monday because of the concerns that even the American rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The futures of the Crude fell from 7% to $99.80 per barrel at the New York Stock Exchange in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, raw materials markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 per barrel in June, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before returning again, on the background of a tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety influenced investors again Monday even after Congress leaders had said they had reached an agreement on the weekend about the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was obscured by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will include the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, said the government on Monday.
At the same time the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts have said that the frantic weekend negotiations had led to a rescue agreement " seem to have failed to revive the feeling of the market.
As the economic situation worsens, the demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the contagion.
From a raw material perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year while home oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, reducing forecasts on the price of oil and gas by about 20% by 2009.
The exploit in the second fourth marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he watched it take place on Sunday's second quarter, when the Jets turned a pointless match back up.
"Never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second fourth began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had equaled the grayness of the threatening clouds that overcame them with a wild game.
Then the Brett Favre quarterback found Lavrenues Coles for a 12- yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tune made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles for another two touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I didn't get out of my path," said Favre of all the passages that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch games, the defense severely hit Cardinals Kurt Warner's quarterback.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a vague launch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith provided for another passage and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner smolder.
The last shift, Bowens' forced fumble, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took advantage of that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had resumed the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely scored a 20 yard goal, for a 34 to 0 advantage.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second or third fourth?"
When he was told both - the Jets granted 21 unanswered points in the third fourth - Mangi said: "I can tell you that I liked the second fourth much more than the third."
There's been a lot of stitches in a small amount of time."
Rested Gebrselassie surpasses its world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia showed again because many consider it the best marathon ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin marathon Sunday and becoming the first person to run a race of 26.2 miles under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory on the favorably flat race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sends in broken pieces for 27 seconds his previous score of 2:03:26, I ran last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie has developed the 26th world record of such an amazing career that has produced a world championship or a world record at any distance from the metro mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would have worsened its asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at departure, 55 degrees upon arrival - Gebrselassie has won Sunday with a hot average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half of the founders such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went to long distances, the marathon record fell more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago he had cramps at the wrists and missed a week of workouts.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started over a week ago, and I had some doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
He was a bit criticized - especially in Kenya, the African East rival of Ethiopia - for having excessively orchestrated his races, usually avoiding many of the best marathon stars in the world, counting on apripist as if it were a half-fund race, and putting world records over the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the size of Gebrselassie's skills as a marathon.
With the cades of four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, competed in Gebrselassie after the openings disappeared.
Just over three miles from the arrival, Gebrselassie made an impenetrable final to separate from Kwambai, which ended up according to 2:05:36, improving his best personal time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, native to Kazakhstan, who is now a German city, has completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise winner of the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
The Beijing Games have been lost with what is described as a bad accident, but it is healed to win in Berlin, making its best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon that took place.
She ran a race by doing well the calculations, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a great detachment, taking them back after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya ended third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the extensive theme park on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, noise, enormous, lies the quiet city where pride and complications of the African-American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first black city incorporated into the country and the home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, abundant guava, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, Harlem Renaissance's most famous writer.
Yet in many ways, the city that described - and that makes tourists stop including it in the Florida tourist guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
It is so independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted to share their thoughts with white man, who "knowing so little of us, doesn't know what is being lost."
Even now, in a year where a black president, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening speech on the race, many here remain suspicious of the outsider's gaze.
"We are very careful about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a resident of the city's oldest church and a lifetime.
"It must be fair."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power takeover and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary centre but also an example in the shade of the oaks of the rural culture of the blacks of the south - sometimes desecrated, sometimes rewarded - born from American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, which everybody here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's leadership transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida within a black history and human drama scenario
Low as a cashier in both life and literature, Hurston brought the readers to the shop owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Out of the street to the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-preserved gardens and courtyards, to which Howard Miller always looked, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever is suitable for the passage rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly this was not from Fodor.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"I used to say it like it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston immortalizes her by quoting men who sing rough songs about their beauty.
He adds, "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned from his family transferred to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, remembers that when Hurston rained in the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today boasts dignified clothing.
Many people were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were clinging.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, leaning on his chair on the patio on the back of Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "he never remained for long."
When hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books went out of the press.
Together with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although it was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, and no great conference.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to all," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change took place in the 1980s.
Orange County officers wanted to place a five-way highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-way road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed La Interstate 4 through the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult time in its history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had put an end to its idyllic isolation of the community
In the 1950s, the battle on racial mixing brought hatred on the door of the community.
"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at the people sitting on one side," said Mr. Franklin.
"In fact, we had a girl who was killed once.
They threw a good deal out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request for forced integration to the Supreme Court, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor for my race".
Residents now say that school breakdown, despite having been positive in some respects, diluted Eatonville's cohesion and jeopardised the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - you embraced your teacher in the morning, you embraced your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and Executive Director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because your white teacher--I mean, there's a cultural division there," Mrs. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcome prejudices, as she did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines such as: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long walk to the Hurston's unmarked tomb and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography about Robert E. Hemenway hit the shelves of the bookstores, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project came just as her most famous daughter had held back the lights of the turnaround.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began to design in 1988 a festival dedicated to Hurston to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state withdrew from its road project.
"The five lanes of the risen highway have brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it in a simpler way: "Now he saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the image the city has of itself.
Those out of town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started to come to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the public historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a renovated and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, can give the feel of a secondary road under the summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to look for Eatonville's story, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permission requested in advance is required for most of the interview, to some things - like the walls on Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Hudson festival expanded, a high level of citizen pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, no better, nor worse and proud, creative, great worker, foolish and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection what can be felt in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And even those younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they just got in here, they'll think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon after the Mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's really a nice city."
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stalls and the huge TV screens of Times Square, they would not realize to be in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, with apex nests above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers that monopolize New York live every day the worst "bad day in the office" since the collapse of 1929.
Factors shake metal reels for the the through the sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin-Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken shirts stretched to a stick on their shoulders.
The employees still wait in line for their morning bagel to the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 on a working day.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the speech of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter so that it would coincide with the late afternoon break at my branch of JP Morgan Chase, a tail of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's door, to withdraw money or to make deposits, but in front of the customer service's door, where old customers order cheque books, tourists ask directions for the big Macy warehouse and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would have learned from Starr, my "trust banker," were in line for my same reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from the smaller banks from the places from which they make commuters, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken money from the so-called trifts (a little like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose subsidiaries operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family members.
In the past few years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was submitted to the controlled administration, and while New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend one Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer who saved it.
The employees and merchants who stood in front of me, scared for another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe port, the bank that is asking for more security on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank went bankrupt, and to her ecstatic Director General Dick Field in all familiarity, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the door in uniform, almost fifty years of my condo, has changed the theme regarding our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expense.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Desecrated Muslim Tombs while Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization "Città anti l'Islamisation" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs like street signs representing mosques with a red line passing through the middle.
The police blamed the extremists on the right for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the political parties on the far right have earned much to the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The culprits traced with spray Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some graves, but the detectives believe it might have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations led by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the accident is somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesman of the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which took place toward the end of Ramadan, a month of religious importance for Muslims.
In the meantime, Austria embarked on a spiritual research journey following its turn to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that took almost 30% of the votes, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, made a campaign with a vehemently anti-immigration ticket and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the head of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against sails and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as related to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, implying that they are political symbols of a continuous Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses made immediately after the elections, which established the extreme right as the nation's strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was brought predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamour star of rock guilty of sexual abuse of minors, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain by the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after they informed the authorities that they were controlling him that he wanted to go to Spain by way of France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to the Kent police last Thursday after he had provided the magistrates with proof of prior arrests of Glitter for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadi, was not present at Ashford's court hearing in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesperson for the Court Service said: "Thursday, 25 September, at Ashford's courthouse, the Kent police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's journey abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the register of convicted persons for sexual offences.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police a seven-day notice on his planned date of departure.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent's police said they don't want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter's move to the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do everything they need to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it's easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have comprehensive systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted persons for sex crimes registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old boys.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to be on a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have moved him to passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
Eventually, he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Prep, west of London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to place him in the register of convicted persons for sexual offences.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom in 1999 for holding images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped by travelling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
Neither heels nor steering wheels nor clothes from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in the private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they must not go on stage.
German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the least known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original flamenco iconography, taking it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day more and more," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, interpreters or performers on the scene.
These people depicted "on the street" are "artists able to transmit passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these greats it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are inner.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With the passion for the "Cante de las Minass" festival, Bauer started in 1997 a long journey aimed at drawing singers, guitarists or dancers using a plated camera.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, recall the classic photography.
The application of various stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, conferring on the modernity photo, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own flamenco conception: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, able to conquer the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, in exhibition these days at the El Photomata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy artists.
The project has become a kind of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited during the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veterans athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment in their life, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think the portrait is the most difficult type in photography.
You meet or meet people, characters you don't even know or give you only a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at the number 20 of via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until the next October 16th.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he's writing is a "lucky"
It is set in places that still do not know and deal with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is caught up with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived in Congo for 20 years and has crossed the Amazon.
Since always favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a random" and that "all indicates that I shouldn't write it."
"If I had good sense, I would not write it, but I will do it equally and hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw passed through the city of the Aqueduct a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "La città y los perros" was, as forecast, the leading figure at the third edition of the word festival.
Vargas Llosa, who won the prize of the Hay Festival to be the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend" book, filled the places of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience to whom he flew the time when the Peruvian, with a wonderful memory and with great doses of humor, evoked as a birth in him the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "joy of reading" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to supple the "lack of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, writing and continuous remaking; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and as "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories lay.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, claiming that, on the contrary, it has "effects" and that "makes people more anti-conformist." That is why he invited the writers to "do not give in to frivolity" and "take responsibility" for their vocation.
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of the races
The celebration of the races that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfights selected for the races had verified that the conditions of the square floor were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather came up against this Festival and prevented you from celebrating two days in three.
Saturday, the rain prevented the second racing of bulls.
Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were supposed to face a bull of Castilblanco, were on the sign.
Therefore, the Festival had regular performance only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting three ears and coming out in triumph, after having toasted with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two races with greetings and an ear, given more by the public than by virtue of the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing from the Los Llanos arena without glory and without pity.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutch, the whistles of much of the public were won.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish passed the block place in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
Agents close the elevator to the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping on the run.
The officers charged the elevator to the two occupants of a van who, instead of stopping, ran away.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The agents after pursuing them, can arrest one of the two occupants, a man about 28 years old, identified as A. A. J., as reported in the communiqué of the Department of Internal Affairs of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The accident occurred when some road officials in Alava were carrying out a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, transgressing the orders, accelerated sharply and passed the lock.
Agents went after them until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the road and its two occupants fled to a forested area.
The agents of Ertzaintza were thus able to arrest one of the fugitives and kidnap the 2,178 kilograms of hashish that were carrying and of having taken note of once inspected the van, a Iveco Daily.
The hashish panels, which were in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
Moreover, since the officials found that the registration had been "doubled" since it did not coincide with that reported in the documentation of the van, the arrest was also charged with the offence of forgery of public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigations to arrest the second suspected person, who managed to escape as already stated, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
A. A. J., 28 years old, was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the next hours.
Arrested actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effect of drugs
The actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of drugs.
One witness saw him perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, according to what was revealed to People magazine by a spokesperson of the California road.
The witness specified that around 4.30 p.m. the Locklear "lighted down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with sudden maneuvers forward and back. Doing reverse, he passed several times in front of his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first glance had apparently not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and had left the vehicle.
She was this person alerting emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"He seemed confused," and for this reason the agents led him to a specialized center for drug use and alcohol to test her.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress has been cooperative and the hypothesis of alcohol excess has been discarded since the beginning, even though "according to what the officers observed at first, we believe that Locklear was under the effect of some drug."
The Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of driving under the effect of some not better specified substance and was imprisoned in the local prison around 7 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was re-established by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Lalamares urges the Andalusian federation of the UI to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The IU general coordinator and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional training federation to make a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sport advisor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of customerism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organisation to take on its responsibilities," said Llamazares as regards the resolution that the party will have to adopt in relation to what has so far been the advisor in the Seville Council.
However, the IU leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to be fully transparent."
Similarly, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public offices."
"Sangre de maggio", the epic bet of Garci
Inspired by Episodes Nacionales by Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci reproposes in Blood de maggio the famous revolt of the Spanish against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the stream of characters and at the same time the social analysis" which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría, head of a large cast of interpreters.
Blood of May, longer than two and a half hours, debuts this Friday in the cinema halls, to become a television miniseries for more than four hours in the future on TeleMadrid.
Great admirer of Galdós literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this film "a dream of his childhood", and believes he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before turning a memorial film for the second centenary of May 2nd. The director had agreed that the story of basing on the novel Episodes Nacionales.
The 15 million budgeted for the whole of the Community of Madrid have represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the scenarios and the appropriate costumes to portray a "a twisted Spain that mistook the choice of the leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence led to a huge delay in the development under the kingdom of Ferdinand VII" observed Garci.
However, the director regrets that he did not receive funding equal to that of Alastriste or Los phantomas de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de maggio, so it was not possible to turn some scenes provided by the script he had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the director of Retour to begin with, influenced what is his usual work practice, the setting up with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before turning together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliant," considering that "part of the director's work resides in going to theatre and to cinema to know what is happening in the field in which he works."
Many of the performers, some of which fall into the cast of Blood of May, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood - his Blood of May, Seven tables de billiard French and, the last selected Los sunflowers blinds - do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "which should instead be known."
From this film Garci does not expect prizes.
"At first you think you're working for posters, then you realize that you're only working for prosperity, and at some point you agree to just shoot an extra film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Seville essence of Ballerina Tortola Valencia
A Sicilian dancer pays tribute to another dancer equally in Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, a Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusa mother (Georina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana, and at the age of three moved with the family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and an Oriental dance specialist.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of the female emancipation, of the caliber of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposes this character to me. I felt incredible."
She supports the dancer: "We do not intend to tell her whole life, but to gather her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tanghi.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic," he explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of his shows, as she does in "The Open Door"; and that of Maestro Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been her pupil.
"Matilde interprets Adult Tortola, the character of maturity.
I am happy because you have agreed to work in my work and this I feel very honored."
The setting also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who interprets the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been dive to the whole round, and who have always had many spasmants."
In the work there is also in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then the whole of Europe, because, usually, she lived in London.
"I wanted to remind you, because I think it's one of the women who have had a huge influence in a given historical period and now nobody remembers it and much less regards its work as something of value" says Bayon.
The show will start today, at 8.30 p.m. at the theater of Lope de Vega.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poeta recentémado" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Councillor for Culture of the Council of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
Thus, the "Trinnium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquelo Chopo de lumino", which was inaugurated last May and which, after having touched the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Councillor to Culture of the Council of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", curated by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most valued Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is that of actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the disturbing idea that Newman has left.
And yet it cost him a lot to give him an Oscar.
And since 2007 he's been retired.
And it was also known that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what a test goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could be better thanks to its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and country died at a particularly dark time, for the fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, in desperate search for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and they remain well people to admire, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the firstborn dead of overdose to the creation of the brand of home and biological food.
All gifts to a country at which it was very costly to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without taking care of either nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, observed that a man didn't die, a time was over.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, the award-winning director with Oscar, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the peak of his career.
The bad boy who arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, ventured to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left an example of a very high level for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few today who tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping high consideration the need for justice and having a serious private life and far away from cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try us and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful even though he certainly missed opportunities not to be.
"Why am I going to eat out burgers today, if I have a steak at home?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, of no one was as proud as that of devoted husband, loving father, wanted grandfather and passionate philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my opinion it was by far the worst to which I have seen it.
A lot of nonsense, which were then taken into account at the time of the evaluation and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense started with the dorsal retreat, which assumed it would go first.
It didn't seem to be a bad idea, but if you're forced to go, it's to pick everything up (including the chip to avoid codes during the race).
Not at all.
You had to go just to take the back (first fool, go only for this) and (after its tail), surprise! they had only 'S' size shirts (second fool, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they have decided to buy only small shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are inevitable compared to the same day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon to take the chip, the queue waiting was 15 minutes and, for more, you had to deposit the backpack.
The expectation lasts more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as was expected, the race started that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once they succeeded in the company, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the waiting for more than 40 minutes, to which attempts of popular rebellion and assault were added to the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the correct order classification because of the chip that, I suppose, did not correctly record the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this will not go into my thoughts.
So I think we're going to continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search receptionist (virtual)
At the MlT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft first presented a new system of recognition of the image and human interaction, a sort of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to travel on the company campus) assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receiptist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen to and understand key words in a conversation with them.
It can also group those present in conversation groups.
In the video example the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that it does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of society.
She asks if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be at her disposal shortly.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a change in strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were equipped with essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for "the least".
All one discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is losing more and more importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
You perform the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You only take the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing the network than in a remote window environment.
What are half of the operating system applications used for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to provide a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, in fact, and I bring back a small example here.
I took the photo inserted in this post in one of the recreation venues for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the drinking machine a sign prompts them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to do network research.
Last week, however, the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be put on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is criminalizing.
La Fabulouse Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio shined in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sanga', as well as Al Pacino ne'Il Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola as well as being part of the typical uniform of the gay musculous parish.
And if we try to list the appearances of the stars, we can re-enact the image of the force with the pointed baffles that lift the weights in the walking circle.
This is basically the typical man's shirt, with the cotton inside, fastened and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as Anglophones call it, although Belgian Fabulous Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels from the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the shirt carry as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels from the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company is not only about the famous "tank".
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, marine shirts, baby-dolls, mini-short...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The big resemblance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
At present, Cruz sisters have taken their new fashion activities very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who give their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango firm made of its new headquarters, as well as the presentation of the most important prizes that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, you've got it quickly.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we created my sister Penelope and I for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honour of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the movies of the '50s is '60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love losing myself in the city and watching how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do so often.
Ballerina, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, even if in the end, everything is collusive and there are many elements in common.
When I was a child, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to work in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to the dress.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to class and essays, to look at themselves in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when they deliver you the wardrobe is the moment you actually meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionals.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you went into a crisis?
But no.
Never felt better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to enjoy life by making less mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a kid, and that gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my own body asks me and I also want to be a young mother, this I don't want to miss.
As for the candidate, I'm not too worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As far as cinema is concerned, you are waiting for several films to appear in different rooms last year.
That's right, and I really want them to come out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything right away and clearly, but it can't always be so.
I want you to come out "The Last Hour" and "In search of the tomb of Christ".
Let's see if you'll like them.
A few days ago you debuted on the walkway with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like you were in the walkway as a model.
Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a long time, simply called me to invite me to London to participate in a charity show for her organization "Dones for a Better World" and the clothes we exhibited – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango - were auctioned to collect funds for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her, that I know her for a long time can confirm that I'm not that true.
Besides, I'm dealing with this good part in which you're involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he asked me to make the pine, I would have done the same.
If it's to help women in the third world, you can't back off.
Alcoholic Reciprocal Drivers will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive alcohol in their blood, to install in their car the system which prevents driving the vehicle in a state of drunkenness or if it does not blow into the device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the Attorney General's Office, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this will have to take a road rehabilitation course.
This initiative, in addition to the Attorney General's Office for Road Safety, will be attended by the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of cars reported more than once for driving in a state of drunkenness then return to driving the car.
The alcohol would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the expired air and prevents the driver from driving if the driver does not blow, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than the allowed one.
The cost is more than EUR 1000 and would be borne by the sanctioned person.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices reduce to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to stop these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And in order to facilitate its development, since the legal reform can be carried out on an ordinary basis, and, without a doubt, the reform necessary for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on a PSOE initiative in which it intends to install this system on school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 5.40 p.m., second programme, the Spanish plane in which the Asturias were travelling landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting, but the rays still forced the hand to use as a visor to see the real couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time... you're from here or...
- No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who are the principles of Asturias and the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport crushed to the red carpet and the military cordon composed of 27 marine soldiers who offer the greeting of honour.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the princess, the wind chima, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they told her that Mexico City was threatening bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before going into the room where the official committee awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they live, one of the city's four largest, they are awaited by a spirited reporter of Mexican television.
Best prize ever offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the most appropriate world to present a fashion prize, which is not Paris and there is probably no more exquisite designer and bont viva of Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of €300,000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his drawings in the window of Mango at number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried from the emotion.
Moreover, it is the second large company store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first one is in London.
The many events, together with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
With the proximity of Chagal's most exquisite TVs, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Nati, with the broken heart and making of necessity virtue, due to the recent death of his brother, has worn a dress of the House and some complements of ELAH to take off the breath and arm of his son Luis - a boy nearly two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the dinner of homage.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors of the house and as knight who is finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without jacket, because both had given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the store in pants and shirts – designed by her hand – turned for dinner, wearing a very sensual black long dress and excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the work, when we were shown the ballroom for ballet essays and she, recalling other times, grabbed a bar and sucked a "big fold".
Inés Sastre did not stop for a walk in the palace premises, but had first shown us the photos of his son on his mobile.
The next day we were pleased with the presence of Olivier Martinez – another guy who moved by bike – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and had previously made sure that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, here's the life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And as if that wasn't enough, they're all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to the libraries on September 30.
Awakening is almost a punishment when it closes every morning at 7 am, but it is even worse to imagine being involved in the frenetic rhythm dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the back-end computer.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are no one and no two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the struggle to get rid of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of his book, a menu of tailor-made options for taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is called "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the libraries thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to gain calm in areas such as the work or in personal relations, this "manual" denies such conviction.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline does not already flow into your veins to find the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off the mind and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children speak during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who talk while staying asleep.
The first time it happens, at most one gets scared, but in fact it doesn't matter much.
It is a benign alternation of sleep called sleep sleep.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Certainly, most of you have said that you had spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadicly (once in life, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason why this phenomenon can be explained.
Sometimes there are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, night enuresis (make the pee in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As already mentioned above can be associated with very high stages of fever, stress or overcrowding.
In any case, it is a phenomenon that has not yet been studied.
Even the intensity with which it appears is extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that happens the contrary (scream, scream, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there are any issues that are generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a way out of the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (e.g. if coupled with insomnia or stress).
What can be done, however, is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child excessively before he goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid TV shows or series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain a certain inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once sleepwalkers show up trying to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless, because he's not aware of what's going on, and you'll interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very worried and episodes have a certain frequency, it is better to consult a doctor or check where there is such a great anxiety in your child.
If you understand what it says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him for information.
You won't get anything, because he's asleep and therefore unconscious to organize his thinking.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he is dreaming of saying it, so we need to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it might lead.
Never tell the child that you could ask him questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not even for a joke.
Such a thing causes enormous anguish.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illaeuseern... finally
The Illhaeusern finally found the path of victory at home after a long unsuccessful period.
Without playing a great game, the Yellow-Blacks have created the largest number of networking opportunities by transforming one into the victory of the game.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers were struggling.
After a first attempt by the captain of the Kauffmann host team who swept the seven with a shot from far away, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the defence of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from far away, then Hirn tall, Romain tip and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block at the center of the camp, leaving only the triggered Riahi at the attack tip.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for the Dannemarie, and immediately after the first Marais network for the well-placed Illhaeusern, he resumed a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the gunner of the Illhaeusern will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be expelled a dozen minutes after leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not bring great problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last few minutes of the game when, after a rocking action, the ball smacked the cross.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Britain.
The President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère department, on Monday, to enchant its representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hoped that "they would present themselves with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit which takes place in parallel with the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the impension of the price of oil, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Eliseo David Martinon's spokesperson, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help companies regain competitiveness and to ensure the working conditions and pay of the sailors".
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stop.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "smooth operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of jams.
Also the port of Quiberon has been blocked, but the connections with Belle-Île have not been interrupted.
On the peninsula of Quiberon a roadblock was implemented.
On Monday the sailors have already proved their determination by burning, starting at dawn, tyres and pallets in front of the fuel deposits at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while taking foot demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended towards the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Manica, like Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the vessels remained at the dock, or to Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Loire Atlantica, interrupted in the evening the blockade of the Total Refinery Note of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide any action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not give up" and "they do not intend to move to Paris", announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on gas oil, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a vessel is reached only with a gas oil less than 0,30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the magnificent
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his Connecticut home.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and still Sam Mendes saluted the legend of cinema and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
This year, the aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries, despite the threats of recession on the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth world company in the sector, maintains the forecast of delivery for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, he delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company trusts widely in the Chinese market, especially for aircraft in the range between 30 and 120 seats.
To date, Embraer delivered in eight years 41 aircraft to Chinese customers.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its activities
The American International Group insurance company, set up by the American monetary authorities, would give up more than 15% of its business in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The IGA is ready to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, specifies the newspaper on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to consider any transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at the IGA.
The activities that the AIG intends to give up include the International Lease Financial Corp. air lease subsidiary, its share of 59% of the Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken in respect of these transfers, the FT continues.
The IGA must quickly recover liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion concessionaires from the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the American authorities impose 80% of their capital.
Paris: History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a crash on Monday, after the House of Representatives spoke against the Paulson plan for the rescue of financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a decrease never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) ended at 10,365.45, below 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst losses in its history (684,81 points) higher than that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of the main technological titles, lost 199.61 points closing at 1,983.73 and the enlarged Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) closing at 1,106.55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the sitting, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected refusal of the bank rescue plan, designed to bring stability to the markets.
By 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives refused the funds requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two republicans out of three refused the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"All this indicates how much the market counts on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it could already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project were actually dying (...) then the witness would be transferred quickly to the Fed – Federal Reserve- (the US central bank, ndr) and other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, financial and economic sector manager at Global Insight.
And highlighting the state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, stressed Piegza.
After Washington Mutual's failure on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's bank assets by the rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, calling for urgent intervention in favour of the banks of the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets "are not only in the face of an American crisis, but in the face of a global crisis," said FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The return of the 10-year Treasury Bonds has declined to 3,632%, compared to 3,827% on Friday evening, while the 30-year-old return is 4,161%, compared to 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama for the first TV duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House, here's a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the headquarters of the republican and democratic campaign proclaimed their respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while deserving, has not been brilliant enough to allow him to slow down in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a champion of undecided voters, found that 39% of them consider Obama the winner, while 25% points to McCain.
A great performance by his Joe Biden listmate, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm on Thursday Obama's advantage.
"To underestimate it would be a mistake.
He has a good idea," said Bill Clinton this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has never ceased to promote his undisputed experience in foreign policy, highlighting the opponent's "ingenuity" with regard to the issues addressed during the first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that.." he often said to multiple shots.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the skills needed to become president," he said.
What since yesterday has been a constant target for the Republican television campaign.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without delay, it has been concise and precise.
He promoted his readiness to make the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain has never understood, unlike Obama," said this weekend, a democratic spot, blaming the Republican for not taking the necessary measures to address the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you yesterday, he denounced Obama, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, in a stormy rain, for an election meeting.
He didn't even say the words "media class" or "workers." The financial crisis goes to Obama, seen by Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"Next week could be a decisive turn," he thought yesterday, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration member, compared Obama's economic intuition to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating the intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street subsults, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of possible energy independence in the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously dodged the financial rescue questions of $700 billion (€470 billion) adopted last night at the Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there were the elections?"
Young people and opponents protested on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge in advance the results of the legislation.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of the electoral seats in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of the legislatures.
While the results were still expected, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some people confess they didn't even vote: "Why? They'll do as much as they want, of my vote," says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made the foreign observers a good example in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of assets, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by the observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been pushed away by the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the vote," complained Iuri Potemkine, spokesperson for the Union of the Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a frontal change," says Alexandre Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential and head of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If members of the opposition come into Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament may involve a television space, regional meetings and bills."
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter into political play because " dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis, and we do not reform any, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the 'organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that has followed the electoral process will recognize the validity of the vote.
He pointed out that participation shares seemed too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) gave way to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you notice that there were elections? Ask Social Democratic Leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the polls.
And there have been a maximum of five Members of the opposition to parliament, the most convenient to power."
Night silence falls on the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
The meeting - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, since Hema-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, seriously shaken by the scandal of infected blood in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected by the virus of acquired immunodeficiency (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
Faced with such a tragedy and population protests, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was slow to draw up a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of designing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, only 38% of people said they still believed in the donation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalled.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to our continued efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and field research over the next few years, we have regained public confidence," he explains before saying proud that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells him that it has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of its foundation.
"And we didn't know if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, that when you have doubts and could achieve a serious disease, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, measures of exclusion are taken.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was refused.
Now, for a few years, it has been demonstrated that this disease has no doubt been transmitted by infected blood.
This episode has shown us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999, a much more efficient technique appeared on the market for the identification of HIV: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow the presence of the virus in the blood of donors to be recognized directly and not the presence of antibodies against it, on which the tests used up to then were based.
The TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, that is, since the person has contracted the disease to the one where the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and thus not being able to identify them has decreased so considerably.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving blood infected with the HIV virus.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected with the HIV virus.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples every year, it will take more than 24 years to find a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion.
I believe that today we can feel calm in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the Hema-Québec leadership.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
We must be constantly vigilant", Dr. Décary continued before stressing that in addition to having secure resources, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies.
"Necessaries increase as the population ages.
Since cancer is the most aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences on the number of donors who on average constitute only 3% of Quebec's population acceptable as donors."
All healthy people who have reached 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria may, however, donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is spread, they will be refused for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we manage to keep an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
The cases of poverty are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they age and can no longer make donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so frenetic that it is hardly an hour to donate blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, the Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, eye cells and skin heart valves that are used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These fabrics are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited at the Héma-Québec which manages the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, there is abundant blood rich in stem cells that can help cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion into the bank of our thousandth cordon blood sample and we plan to collect more than a thousand each year.
You should start proposing them for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of taking cordon blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they can't access you", because Héma-Québec lacks the necessary means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Calcium - The Impact in semifinal
The Impact Montréal has qualified for the semi-final of the A series, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during a second decisive match of the quarter finals, at the Saputo Stadium.
The centrocampista Antonio Ribeiro, marked the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first goalless time on both sides, David Texto and Rocco Placentino marked the successive networks for Montreal.
Per and Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
We remember that at the first round of the round-trip, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will confront the Vancouver Whitecaps in semifinal.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, the Thundler completed a first 3-1 in the return game winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinal.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed in the day.
In brief - Kovalev's decisive network
The Canadian and its aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the offensive phase of the game winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, scored a goal, made two steps, and collected a passage for the victory, in the fourth of the preparations games of the Habs.
Decisive for victory the only network signed Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet, Russian warned.
I need another game to feel at ease."
"He tried to outdo it in the first period, he noticed Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a good ovation."
North-easted charest
The Prime Minister does not exclude the start of the elections before the end of the year.
Following the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon yesterday, in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to be elected at today's partial elections.
"To extend the borders of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented to Levis yesterday, through instruments with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Image mill".
On three maxi screens, they confused the spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in the middle of the election campaign.
During the press conference, moreover, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the start of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very busy.
The "North Floor" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the most recent speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North-Northern territory to the 49th parallel- was never the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel with immense potential", but did not speak about timing or investment shares, as well as did not explain what the precise priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
Most of all, it has been limited to pointing out what it believes is a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has experienced several improvements following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to the list written by Charest, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "great territory the double of France", is here, is Quebec.
Not only is he here, but he is insidious in us," he insisted, as if he wanted to urge a national myth founder.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the golden fever in Abitibi, the national engineering, the Bay of James.
"It is up to us, it is our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind his back.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position maintained by all governments.
There is a borderline on which no agreement has been in place for a long time and, when the opportunity is presented, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government," he said.
Moreover, "on account of climate change, we must re-evaluate the North," he said about the north-west passage, which will be open all year round because of the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister estimates that occupying the territory is a duty."
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit ?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the Ungava PQ), have already initiated the consultation of some thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) held an important position, began work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would also adhere to the principles of sustainable development.
The North Floor will be" concerted, ordered and respected the environment", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was on the other hand one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail in honour of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival as leader of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to re-establish the Beauharnois Centrale in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future," Jean Charest said.
During the press conference, another reference is used, this time conservative, the "Walk towards the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the project on the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, Charest stated that its implementation would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will do it," he confessed to his militants, sparking applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not waste the opportunity to start a poll in the autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stressed that he was certainly very busy, particularly in a mission of the Federal Council in China and in the Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal Head with a platform for nationalist resolutions, in particular the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed read like oil: the PLQ calls above all for the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the North Floor was sceptically welcomed.
PQ leader Pauline Marois has wiped out Quebec's Northern Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
In your opinion, the Liberal Government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had, "we would have made progress today," commented Marois next to Jean-Talon's candidate (scrutiny today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ stated that it supported the Government's adoption of the Northern Plan.
"What we hope for is that all of this is not simply perceived as a show," commented Sébastien Proulx, a substitute for Mario Dumont, back from the holidays today.
Letter - An dishonored country
He was Vic Toews, former minister of the "Justice" (irony of luck) of Harper's cabinet, to allow himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a " shame" for Canada.
To dishonor in this way a woman who has fought relentlessly for justice and who deserves our admiration says much about both the environment of the Prime Minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, to have not returned a citizen detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time when the facts against him took place.
The only government that, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, for information, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Order of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, invoke Omar Khadraffin's return to Canada to be subject to a regular process.
It is proper that same government that closes its eyes before torture: it doesn't care much that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We still do not realize this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", a word that Harper does not stop to show off and that sounds so foolish on his lips.
Here we have arrived at the time when there is no morals anymore: you can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a government leader until today minority (see what will happen after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches the Virtue, the Respect for the Law and the Order represent salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
This is the shame, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter by Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world's largest auriferous company has waged a defamation lawsuit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house that is castrated with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a defamation dispute, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his.
The outcome of the process is scarce, the writers and editor of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a substantial amount of money in order to organize their own defence and fight, with a decidedly odd weapon, against an army of lawyers funded by practically bottomless pockets of the mining company.
In other words, in these arms struggles I learn, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation which would boost his opposition and frighten anyone who is again trying to take a decision on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it's in front of the public that he should have presented his own view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada the debates usually take place with the exchange of opinions and not with manganese strikes.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to open its books, documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of teams of independent researchers who could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and misappropriates petitions and letters in support of Black Canada's authors.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his contempt for the same audience is obvious?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word only indicates lawyers who are deeply paid and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn't understand – or doesn't want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Canada Nero does so first because he refuses the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in view of what many perceive as a sort of tangle (researching for the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Black Canada an ultimatum inciting them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, the argument carried out by Barrack Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies the right to quote genuine sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country such as Canada it is impossible to study and discuss uncomfortable topics for the richest companies in the world, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following scientific standards as the authors of Black Canada do.

For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, is able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures by Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not pursue a transparent debate at all.
This is at the expense of the university world, as is the case with the same public debate in Canada, and it is now time for governments to take measures to limit abusive complaints.
Operation - Rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the head of the Congress, representatives of the Republican and Democratic deployment, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest bailout plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been on Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides: checks on its actual implementation by the elected leaders, new mechanisms that guarantee the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of homes for missing payments, as well as a right of inspection on the salaries paid to the managers of the protected companies.
The US Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," said the Bush administration's representative Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been taken in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street," the democrat explained.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, invaluable discomforts and turmoil would have poured out on the daily lives of Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a further failure on investors.
The time limit granted was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates for the American presidential elections later joined the negotiations and were rather in favour of the agreement, but they did not express their dissatisfaction with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama deserves to have added some provisions to the agreement, in particular the one that will allow the owners to maintain their domicile and the one that is related to wages for state-owned business managers.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary", he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to find out if he will vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"As far as I've read, it's something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move on"
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700-billion plan aims to re-acquire with taxpayers' money the doubts, risk and unsold assets of the American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the explosion of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgages at risk (mutui) , then extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and lead to the freezing of liquidity and the disbanding of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge to blow up the first draft of an agreement last week.
It seems to have been out of that blind alley since the Democrats accepted that the "toxic" assets of some companies in difficulty are only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone in Congress, a provision was added that, if the government were to face losses over the five years to come because of this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which an additional 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of the Congress.
In exchange for its aid, Washington will obtain shares of participation in protected companies that will be paid dividends in the event of profit and that it will be able to resell when the waters are calmed.
In accordance with the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the procedures for pinning real estate loans and to set limits on remuneration and start-up allowances paid to the managers of the undertakings concerned.
From now on, the architects of the plan would like to vote for the House of Representatives, and the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is not yet certain that they will be given the way to their plan.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both in the republican and democratic deployment.
"Of course Washington doesn't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, member of the House Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But certainly not taking advantage of taxpayers..
Leader of a small group at the so-called Congress "the caucus of skeptics", democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw quick conclusions and carefully examine the path to be taken," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would give up its competitor's purchase, in full failure after the loss of EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) for the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of the twenty largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It is not money lost, said the Dutch Minister of Finance yesterday, Wouter Bos.
On the other hand, the influence and the right to vote in banking matters are accepted.
It is certainly something that savers and families now appreciate that times are being announced uncertain"
During this period, at the other end of the Manica, the British government seems to be in the process of nationalising another bank in the ticket for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all the loans currently under way at the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be you to buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
From the beginning of the economic crisis Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
The beauty with blue eyes was for a long time his ace in the sleeve, for others his weak point.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the grumpy smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to true sacred monsters.
What a constancy!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut ranch, after lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the early years.
Less monumental of Brando, to whom he resembled and for a long time was a sort of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Mixed couples often have magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 by a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots one of the glorious visions of the American dream will be born.
A humble ego, last quality brand.
Since he recognized a whole country invaded by the safe made man, the fighter of the war of the Pacific, proud in the fight, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, television and early cinema.
The same man as a civil rights activist was also the motorist driver who qualified according to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
They leave with him the shadow areas of a reserved, discreet, committed star, allergic to show-business scandals, of which you will never be able to fully reveal the mystery.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a dive to the heart for the moviemakers, while his great characters pop the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is proposed through its interpretations.
The fascinating cow-boy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy are unable to desire his hot wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La gatta on the roof which is adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him in the cloths of the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that did not keep what he promised.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone to history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Lassù someone loves me, Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute maleviper in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best movie in 1973.
Player of bitter and vengeful billiards in The Spaccone, magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), The color of Martin Scorsese's money, which he earned in 1987 the only Oscar on 9 appointments.
That face through the years, it was his.
He's still there.
The epochs happen through its path.
Young people know him especially for the cult movie Slap Shot- Dry Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, Coen's brothers.
The circle was closed with a last role as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in my father's age, in 2003.
Unlike the most famous cinema legends that soon abandoned the trade, Newman will remain in the halls for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its costumes, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, French filmmaker, defined him, with an irony tip, "a living challenge to underplay", judging his performance exaggerated.
The profession has not always been a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, drunk or desperate, of which he expressed abstention and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, able sensitivity.
Jennifer's first time in 1968 (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), along with Joanne Woodward's wife in the role of the protagonist, drew a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott for an overdose, dedicated the film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a discrete and sad film.
Among the countless raindrops yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old comrade Robert Redford (they had recited together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) affirmed with infinite sadness" His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
In addition to a legendary career, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of the Hollywood drift is turned off.
We will have extravised her face to stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her a choice of bad taste, although born as a gag.
However, the revenues of those sales were destined for its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of resting on his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter saying "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there, it was a privilege."
And as much privilege was for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
So, citizen model, and much more.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & members invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and members will be discussed.
The political man and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed in an association with the criminal who has caused considerable damage, and of other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Procura, the money obtained from tender notices was used by them for private purposes, and they have often certified the conduct of the activities by means of false invoices.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million florins, ended in part in the cases of the Fiatal Ballal organization, in part in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they have taken the money obtained from invitations to tender on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To make them, the invoice blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, the circular stamps instead were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And in order to decide on whose behalf to issue the invoices, it was established, among other things, during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the latter's confession he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for the consumptions, on the model of these were prepared the invoices to be sent to the invitations to tender, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András, who, according to our information, has drawn up above all the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "travel studies" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and members in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restorator, would not all enter the premises together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later called Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért, pulllula of formal errors and content.
A pension of Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay overnight, but 130 guests were in the invoice.
But the compilers of full-invented invoices overstated when they reported the Pigal Kft., this also deals with catering, in whose account - according to the information issued to the judicial authorities - did not even include the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, company administrator, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he immediately realized that it was fake documents.
"I remember the name and game Iva of our company was in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons, it did not even return the fact that according to the bill a hundred people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
By the way, the invoice was catering and their restaurant has been out of operation for a long time.
Assiduous invoice compilers did not care to inform themselves that the travel agency in Budapest of their choice, organizes only travel abroad, so they have foolishly indicated on the invoice with payment in cash travel in Hungary, which did not agree with the company's practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as demonstrated during the survey, VAT was also included in the invoice, while travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Revfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, in fact, on the services offered by the company it is necessary to apply VAT to 15% and not 25% as indicated on invoices, in addition the hotel employees only issued printed invoices, while the invoice manufactured was handwritten.
In addition to this, "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated as activities carried out the goods by road, as is known from the prosecution procedure, activities that were not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
In addition for formal defects - non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it has been discovered that invoices issued in favor of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters did not pay any attention even to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) had lunched a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, precisely for this reason the company's editor, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
Invoices have been issued consciously
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictional invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued an invoice on request by Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favor of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million Florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictional invoices.
He collaborated with Zuschlag and partners also the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for about 5 million florians to the Jobb Jövőért Alapitvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület Association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
No movement of money because the prepared invoices were then stolen, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of invoiced companies belong to those who are related to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized by the Director General of the Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, which deals with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles.
The company issued various invoices in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media, with a value of approximately 18 million Florins.
According to the data of the investigation, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The Director-General of this company was a Romanian company to which between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would forward the documents concerning the company.
According to Kubatov, during the investigation, he acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány and the value was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian masonry founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received a job.
However, the companies have returned useful because, at the request of the co-legislative lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the foundation documents of the companies, invoices were issued to the associations related to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generació.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov has issued 15 invoices to the various entities for a total value of 14.2 million Florins.
The Attorney-General considers that Kubatov has overrun 10% of the invoices and VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictional invoices, manufactured for the competition notice of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generació and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 presented a ban for the public utility agency of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 guilders per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the notice.
So that this did not come to a close, they presented to TMA five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Public Education.
At the hearing a part of the accused, as they have already done in the public prosecutor's office, will probably report on the progress of the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the defendant number one, János Zuschlag, would decide to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has promised several times to speak of everything in an extended manner, he has not yet done so.
It must be seen whether it is in his interest, it could also be that the socialists have made agreements with Zusi, which - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to make the scapegoat.
Zuschlag for now could also have offended himself because his requests for relief from his prison conditions, that is, the granting of house arrests, have not yet been fulfilled.
While the perpetrators of non-reparable commercial crimes and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which to him is not granted.
The psychology of auctioning in excess: why spend more money?
At auctions the buyers are prone to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and research economists at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study on Science magazine, men do not want to stay back in a race such as eBay auction, so they are available to pay even a higher price.
The research sought to trace the nervous pattern of this "lot" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the auction game, in which the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the body striated under the cerebral cortex enters intensively into operation when you lose the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise of the price is explained by scanning the vehement reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group carried out a financial investigation.
In this survey, three groups tendered against a partner under different conditions.
The control group reported how much the actual value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
To another group besides this they promised that in the case of winning they would receive another prize of $15.
The third group would have received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost their money in case of a loss at the auction.
The difference between the two groups consisted of the fact that for one of them the win was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
By checking the hypothesis of neurologists the members of the group playing "against the loss" were willing to make higher bets than the control group or "winner".
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These so far explained the phenomena that can be found at auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurologic image helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we came to a third explanation" - Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York, said.
Hepatitis: when to contact your doctor?
Almost half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, but in Hungary, chronic liver diseases are mentioned among the first causes of death.
In Hungary the number of hepatitis patients amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7,000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know how to be infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of infectious liver diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogenic agent: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g., water and food infected), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal loss, saliva).
For travellers it is useful to vaccinate against A and B virus, against C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellow spots are formed on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the faeces become clear and the urine dark, the healing takes place within two to three weeks.
A million people die every year for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten person receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subsidise liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical analysis.
This disease is much more frequent than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
In today's world, the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Because a routine laboratory examination also reveals that the disease is worth talking to your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, thus ceases the infectious power and may be prevented from developing tumors.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by sick people's associations around the world.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent survey, religious faith works as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford have conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God influences the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
An electroshock of 12 Catholic believers and the same atheists was performed in the context of the somewhat bizarre survey, while all of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
Based on the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first of a series of research in which in addition to academics also participate scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University.
The test was performed exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the Hermelino by Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would give rise to a sort of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's picture was chosen because he did not differ too much from the other and considered it to be a reassuring effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this space of time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while they observed or painting on religious or other subjects.
The Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care of them" and "they calmed down and were pervaded by peace".
Looking at the image on a religious theme, they realized 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image from the strong effect also for atheists, but you must find the right image.
"We need to look for an image to which they have very positive feelings, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases can change our personality." - added Wright.
After the excellent results, only the question remains whether the painting of a Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of such a caliber is presented to the believers, what effect could it have on pain control?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On the day of the tenth birthday Google can claim to be in the pockets of people as well as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, what outpatient clinic they attend and what they care about.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors, that's not enough.
What concerns skeptics who compare with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see the substance of the web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as many personal data as possible from its users and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google's founders that it was: "we enter into a system all the information of the world!".
According to Google’s director interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still beginning to manage all the information.
To the question what happens in five years Schmidt replied: he would like if Google could answer questions like "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what would be the right job for me?", but the software can't answer apparently simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that exactly the words they are looking for, from which IP address they are searched, and on which page interested are stopped after the search.
Through the Personalized Search started two years ago users e.g. can memorize their browsing history, they can relate to what they have looked for and clicked, these will eventually generate far better results; on this same logic it is based on recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our previously declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I'm dealing with? - concerned users of Google's data monopoly are asked.
In most cases, the counter-reactions of the internauts are caused by the fear experienced by the size of the potential power represented by the firm, and not by the sense of guilt, by the fear of punishment, by the desire for freedom or even by the rebellion to power.
However, it is confirmed that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of the accused.
The most striking example of this in recent times was perhaps coordinated action against the pedophiles of Brazil, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
Concerned Internet users about personal rights, on the other hand, claimed relief in May when the company - in agreement with the EFF Legal Protection Association - successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: not even afterwards can Google be forced by any point of the constitution to provide any information required secretly by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully extracted almost 50,000 web addresses and a thousand research expressions obtained in connection with the confirmation of the child protection law passed years before, but however it failed to obtain the individual user search lists and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back to two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data are throwing Google away because they believe that this is the way their intimate sphere and private life are being damaged by starting to use their services and rise up with the revolt of multinationals who stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of fans, activists and computer users appearing in many countries see in them the future generation of large companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as a world conqueror because of Windows, although they both fight for the same purpose.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code kept always up-to-date and the program package is much more accessible, youth and cool of the official software colossus practice.
But it can also happen because the geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies just one of the key words most often repeated in recent years, the web 2.0.
The web 2.0 speaks only of collaboration, to intentionally leave traces behind us and to exploit the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
A young average can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists its musical tastes, all of these can insert them into systems like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which automatically appear its most recent photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa.
At the same time, we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the common tour of friends, easily comes to know with those who spent the night her perfidious boy or a company can fire an employee because she wrote a sincere opinion on the corporate summit: one thing is sure, the concept of private life now has completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life do so to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid Google's monopoly can do so (starting for example with Scroogle using Google's search system but who at the same time does not voluntarily leave traces).
There are not a few people who do not register on community pages for not being found, Google's online applications, from text processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions that are not related to huge server parks and that do not make up our best existing profile so far.
Public opinion waits not so much in secret when Google takes out the claws.
Currently the company with its 156 billion dollars worth more than IBM (14 billion dollars), Intel (144 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, services introduced in record time, instead cause serious damage not only to Microsoft but also to many software development companies.
However, the critical observers next to all this find alarming points: the corporate summit, for example, has completely rejected the employee protest after doubling the company's asylum line, has considered the repeated catering to the daily pleasure of employees to be too costly, but all this diminishes in view of the fact that in 2006 Google has nailed the head to the Chinese government and, in accordance with their agreement, the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal regulation of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that Google's project of scanning and storing books and magazines will take such proportions that the company will soon be in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, others are afraid of the health system, in fact we can create our health profile with our reports, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scroogled account of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming manner.
Two minors helped Ózd's double killer disappear
The police interrogated two minors about the double murder of Ózd, suspected of having helped to make the traces of the crime disappear - said Tuesday the spokesperson of the Police Question of the Borsod region.
Young people have acknowledged the offence to their accusers, and they are currently being accused of favouring them.
The two minors, two girls according to the information of the MTI, defend themselves on foot.
The favour is punishable up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old man from the scene, was put in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He is suspected of premeditated homicide committed for profit.
From the survey it turned out that the twenty-nine-year-old had a huge debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle the debt, for this reason last Wednesday he lured his creditor into a Ózd yard where he and his nine-year-old daughter were killed.
According to MTI's information, the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock listing of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolowski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer advanced by the Poles despite the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which intends to sell in a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial daily E15 states that the offer of Poles represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press so far they have presented an offer the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all concerned the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead in the future to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Country Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Bank Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of the European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday comments on the international economic crisis already speak of "a second September 11".
The global financial disaster has taken place thanks to the American President, who accuses La Repubblica, who has not been able to compact his party behind a speedy bill, whose aim is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as Warren Buffett's billionaire super financier said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second September 11th.
A part of Madrid's press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy on the edge of the barrage.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and this will continue to affect the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the Congress vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means for managing the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just when the greatest transformation of the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to abandon the threat - mention the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a rescue doll to the financial institutions that are paying and with taxpayers' money can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then they will no longer be sufficient either the financial means or new, improvised solutions.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on the dismembered financial markets.
Only on Monday did weak financial institutions get more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which it seems more and more real the anxieties that even European taxpayers, like the American ones, will have to put their own portfolio in order to remedy the crisis.
The EU has not so far been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
"Salvators" must not immediately disburse the EUR 100 billion, however it would be better if they determined in which case it is appropriate to touch taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
The intelligent machine mimics the flying of the skull
What could be the best way to develop anti-collition technologies if not to imitate the sensors of the obstacles in nature?
For example, the bees.
In the surprising project presented to CEATEC in Japan the Calabrians gave the initial strategic direction to the Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collition systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo the Nissan built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotized mini-auto with the properties of the bees, with the ultimate aim of creating a system able to scan all collisions.
Flying the bees form their own personal oval space that really resembles our protective shield - explained to the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of the PR technology sector and research and development.
Important is the role of the ape view, capable of a view of 300 degrees in each direction.
Engineers have attracted the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the ape view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters distance within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the ape, changes immediately direction by rotating the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance exercise, unlike the current system, is carried out in a completely instinctive way.
"If it weren't like this, the robot car wouldn't react fast to avoid collisions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot auto project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the harmful layer and more internal than the protective shield, within which collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what makes a bee to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in an eyebrow.
But unlike bees, the deviation cannot go upwards or downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the steering direction of the wheels.
Instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is fed by batteries to lithium polymers, lighter and with a high energy density, which means that their duration is higher than that of lithium ions.
According to Andoh it is important the instantness of the intelligent reaction, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store them.
This robot has to process some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so it uses only a memory of a few tens of Kb.
There is no need for a memory of gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions which, they predict to Nissan, can be installed on the standard vehicles within 10 years.
Additional application possibilities can be represented by unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoids obstacles on the road leading to destination.
They also found the name of the very expensive child
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue law was drafted for the purchase of disproportionate credits, to be applied in several parts.
In the first passage, half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements protracted up to midnight on Saturday according to the Eastern Coast time the conference leaders decided the $700 billion rescue plan after a debate that lasted for days - Reuters reported.
We have taken serious steps forward - said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the House of Representatives according to which it has only remained to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the plan's compromise.
The Treasury Minister Henry Paulson speaking of the outcome of the compromise stated: the program will work and will be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelossi, it is not about saving Wall Street but about the reversal of the economic carriage.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8 p.m. in Washington (2 p.m. on Monday night according to Central European time), but did not bring a large growth of the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the draft defined economic stabilisation law of 2008 concerning the program, after which it will reach the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday night with the Pelosis, then joyfully welcomed to the White House the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made last night and very much appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Fratto spokesperson of the White House.
However, the programme differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which provided that the $700 billion would be spent all on the purchase of securities with disproportionate loans behind it.
Now as a first step you can spend up to half the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday of the Congress, with these the Treasury Ministry will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind it, the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will monitor the program to which the President of the Federal Reserve also participates.
The expenditure of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the law, the Ministry of Treasury may apply a combined tactic: it may at the same time purchase credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" credits.
The purchase can take place through auctions and directly - they have announced competent of the ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for interested companies to take part in an insurance programme where the Ministry of the Treasury guarantees the means which give cause for concern, for which companies will pay a price appropriate to the likely damage.
Henrz Paulson said: the law provides the means necessary for 700 billion dollars to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of wrong financial means, their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to get us ready to introduce the newly signed law - it has added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and awaiting state aid think instead that the government will limit their success, defined by the overseas slang simply as golden parachutes.
Limitations of payments will only take place in some cases, and the limitations also depend on how the Treasury Ministry will offer aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry acquires under an auction, it will impose an overrun on the golden parachute, if it does not retire the director of the deceased bank.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate appropriations the government will act aggressively to ensure that the money of the directors is not exaggerated.
To this it must be added that the existing contracts of the golden parachute will not change, the limitation is only valid for new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation on the remuneration of the general administrators - commented on the action by the Democratic Barney Frank Chairman of the Committee responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also earn if the economy, and together with it the bank saved, will stand up.
The proposal for a law includes that over the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal which provides for the return of the expected losses from the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course from both sides there were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, not to defend taxpayers' dollars - said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

In the other sectors of the processing industry there has been an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector prices increased by 0.3% in August in domestic industrial sales, first of all as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the price of gas carried out by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared to 12 months, given the domestic sales of the manufacturing industry, the biggest increases in the oil processing sector (32.4%).
In the manufacture of products resulting from metal processing the price increase was 13.2%, 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco representing a determining weight.

Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that the US-Hungarian visa-exemption agreement will enter into force on 12 January - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion, "now everything depends on the fact that the electronic input and control system is built in time".
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be the entry permit, but before departure tourists will have to be registered.
The Hungarian diplomat will continue negotiations in Washington from now on.
He will meet with the Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will hand over the medal of the Order of the Hungarian Republic Cross with the Star and hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also joined in favor of the bank rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, guaranteed their support for the 700 billion-dollar government plan for bank rescue, but there are politicians claiming the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
Representatives of Congress and Administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they had concluded an agreement of principle on the bank rescue plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package for the release of the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more suitable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys with the focus of economic issues Obama has regained a bit of advantage again, while McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican Convention with the appointment of Vice President Sarah Palin, has disappeared.
Obama in a speech to Detroit expressed the hope that the Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains those consumer protection steps which were also supported by him.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn't let himself escape from defining the economic ideas of McCain.
McCain in an interview with the ABC explained that "all of us will send this situation down with difficulty ... but doing nothing is not a road to go."
The Republican Senator reported that the proposal included the establishment of a supervisory committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outputs of the top managers, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no merit in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi reported on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more self-aware - thus analyzes Der Spiegel the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the Internet edition of the German magazine on the left, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents to analyze the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polytologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took over.
The Christians-social have modernised Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are drifting away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a great surprise to the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago had been feasible: the undisputed hegemony of a state-party ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was precipitated to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 still in the period of the so-called Stoiber.
This is the reason for the modernization of the region, which devours parents.
Sociologists have predicted it 40 years ago, but they have made a mistake of a lot of time. But secularization, the results of education, the settlement of the Germans of the East and the North in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of the voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing possibilities and the political consequences are evident.
The pole of the right is intact, only inside the pole the voters have become more aware cars, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups, free professionals, artisans, diplomats and graduates, have moved away from the CSU.
Here support for CSU has fallen below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper "Who with whom?" in the article "The party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confused Austrian internal political situation created after the elections.
SPÖ intends to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ's intervention in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections were made, now it revolves around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast by the TV the leaders of the parties have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann President of SPÖ confirmed that he wants to deal with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left the question open if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of ÖVP, as vice-cancellier.
As stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was rejected in any case.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer has responded prudently to red offerings.
As he said, collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
If your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still open in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ repeated being open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition we are ready to assume our responsibility to govern," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation needs to be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began, which was organised this year by France with the Presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, MP Fides of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenary as the main rapporteur of the Congress drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimir Špidla responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were the governments, European social partners and representatives of the major European civil and rights organisations within equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, recalled, in addition to discrimination in recruitments, that the Roma are evicted from the labour market in the first place because of their low schooling.
"Most Roma young people do not have an average degree of education and as a result of elementary education of poor quality only a number of them can achieve a higher degree of education".
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in promoting human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to make aware of these links in the wider area between Roma and non-Romans.
As a Roma school begins earlier, its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market are increasing; taxes paid for income and consumption contribute to the nation's budget.
"The right of European citizenship of Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of disaggregation of schools, and that is why it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be properly respected.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, Roma children must be given the opportunities given by the democratic space so that they can contribute as citizens in full the future of Europe" - Járóka asked.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized each year, the Berlin meeting last year is to ensure a unique forum to promote the anti-discrimination objectives and equal opportunities set at the state and European level.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the impassed Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Although the bad election defeat has not yet fallen the heads, at the summits of the Bavarian CSU it has for the moment been postponed the discussion of personal matters.
The president of the party Erwin Huber and the regional governor Günther Beckstein still remain in place, the question is until the mercy lasts.
The fate of tandem that has suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes will decide the party's extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
The two very critical politicians have in any case made known that they are not being attacked with all the forces to the chair.
So they tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that one day after the "Tsunami Bavarian" claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber then at the height of his career, the Christian-social Union obtained 60.7%, now after the coup d'état against Stoiber fell to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of German GDP.
However, conservatives in the southern region are always of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to coalition.
As the first sign of the reorganisation within the party the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the small exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the Liberals of the FDP and with the Free Electors exhibiting right values for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate in the Free Voter list, Gabriele Pauli entered the legislature whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity of coup by the Huber-Beckstein couple to then treat the woman without regard to the great ambitions.
CSU managers now concentrate all their forces to stabilize in some way Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also play an active role, which has been in the shadow so far. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU defined on 28 September the bitterst day of his political career.
On Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful towards the CSU, according to which they would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to become chancellor after the Bundestag elections set for September 2009 if the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, will not be re-established with common forces.
According to Merkel, which does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not negatively affect the great coalition of Berlin.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, the crisis of the Social Democrats still lasts.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of well-being and stability guaranteed in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but it is explained by the brochures made in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million people has been unopposed for more than a decade, before the elections of yesterday the opposition gathered under the name of the United Democratic Forces (SDO) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional change to the 2006 elections held in circumstances discussed, "conceded" some seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS therefore gave up a previously evaluated boycott.
Behind the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which called for credit to reduce the import of ever-priced Russian natural gas and agreed to give Russian pipelines in possession of Beltransgaz crossing the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter into the Belarusian political situation considered anti-democratic.
It referred to a detachment that the OSCE, by assessing the election campaign, had put the emphasis on positive movements rather than on failures, such as the prohibition on the application of a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's rapid report on Monday also criticised the campaign, during which opposition candidates in practice could not appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this opposition, an improvement in the political climate can be seen: the political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also prepared for a small confrontation with Moscow by continuing to deny recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, has considered the two countries independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said to our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the 2006 election opposition, it is desirable that he remain despite the fact that "the power was afraid to bring even one opponent into a Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not provide for action to protest the results, but rather tries to get the voters the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course we have a lot of problems, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but I also see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that not even the most officially assisted ceto, that of the pensioners, considers the Lukashenko regime appropriate, which considers its main result to be the creation of social security.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in economic deficit it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security "which recalls sepulchre silence" - Milinkevich says.
Unlike opposition politician, the Russian observers judged the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev President of the Community Independent States said to the Russian press agency RIA Novosti: "men believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that there were swirling doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from now on, this new measure is taking place against the scissors, against whom it stamps and then goes to drink a coffee at the bar in working hours.
The novelity of anti-fanulloni was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The swivel doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services," says the minister.
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens.
This is reformism," Brunetta points out.
With Palazzo Chigi completes the installation in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of swivel doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from the employees, the Secretary General assures: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all".
I mean, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and cornnet.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a beautiful cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand".
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister then notes that "in three months the absences for sickness of public employees have reduced by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand more people at work in one year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make Public Administration more efficient
Italian, " whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees joined forces to challenge the rules of the Brunetta Decree by acceding to the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service will now disband numbers about the least absenteeism at work due to illness - writes the consumer association - the people of 'operous ghosts' are constantly growing.
In fact, there are thousands of employees of the correct and productive public administration in Italy who have united to declare war on the illegal rules contained in the decree."
In particular, the Tar will object to the exclusion of additional economic treatments for illness dependent on the reason of service; the extension of the hours of availability of the sick worker, within which inspection visits are made, and other aspects contained in the new provisions intended by the Minister.
Incidental work, Napolitano: "Central prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures testifying to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates the 58th National Day for victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data broadcast by Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of job prevention is," said the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalid of work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "expressed appreciation for the continued associative commitment to the prevention of workplaces, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of the families of victims and the awareness of the public".
"It has, of course, been raised an outraged 'sufficient', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, because of their size, provoke the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion but the daily reality presents us dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is given to the numerous initiatives promoted in school for a more direct awareness by young people who are faced with the world of work.
It is necessary to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to delay in the warning of its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative rules.
For his part, the president of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber has emphasized "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all the institutions a firm commitment towards putting it urgently to an end".
"Data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not remove the number of white deaths from the work," said the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "downside trend" to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when the attention is relaxed that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level there is still too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our view - Mercandelli has stressed - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school."
"It serves a further effort - it has added - as regards communication and public awareness.
But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli also denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation provided for workers' victims" and the "assistent liability towards which the system has been moving in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return to the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who are ill must not depend on spontaneisms or enlargement from time to time arranged by the legislator".
Mp3 readers on charge, putting the hearing at risk
Listening to high volume music for an extended period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a communication in Brussels refers to the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identifyed Health Risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour per day holding the high volume device risk a permanent loss of hearing ability".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and mobile phones at high levels can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings - the EU responsible continues - there is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters the most, we need to raise the awareness of consumers and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion in order to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - the EU executive concludes - confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related equipment".
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but there is growing concern about the hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damage by using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of noise exposure.
In its opinion, the European Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical equipment if they listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceeds the current limits of maximum noise permitted at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under these conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would cover 5-10% of the users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today we begin, in March we close, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which was established this morning in its new seat behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
After closing the doors in March, the Junta and the City Council will evaluate analysis and projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bubble" of the Campidoglio and his mayor Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are represented all the political, social and cultural ideas - it wishes to stress German - will have to provide proposals for an idea of development of Rome, of which the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the municipal council, will then be able to avail themselves.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
By March it will finish its work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of useless things, since its opinions will not be binding, German replied: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be there, as in France with the Attalian Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be crucial.
Too often, politics is breaking down on the management of daily life and on the emergencies that arise from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, working with seriousness to the development of Rome and its future."
Moreover, the mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless body nor a body: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a euro and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences expressed by the Capital".
For German, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or fixed, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which it has absolutely needed, thinking in a spirit of unity to its future".
A future that, the Mayor of Rome states, "will not be limited to the present municipal boundaries but will look far beyond" not only in the view of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but also "in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He wrote a well-known American politician who keeps us going independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, decimated the US economy and had relations with the enemy Islam (as he does today as a private citizen).
Attacks against Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big hard face: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that has had in all two governors and five black senators!".
They are actually attacks that don't say much; they are clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will it be a good president? Then there are the polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
Even in this case, there are people who speak with their hearts but not with their brains.
A newspaper from the Mississippi, in the viscera of the South United States, wrote an editorial: once in the cabin to vote we know who will give his vote the American patriot.
It comes out one side of the American mentality kept covered up to the last.
"Tell me what you want, then we'll figure out where to put the cross, whether it's Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
Things never said before, which almost certainly appears to be the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to kicks in the seat.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who lost their lives and Americans were not forced to pack.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge job to do.
U.S., the economic rush is also felt on journalists: in newspapers it is time to cut. And many people blame the Internet, the "killer" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control of the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as the general public intends to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that journalism at national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses open up a cross to the Internet, for many views as the "killer" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that they "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism today is between those who run the newsrooms - the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure that their reporters divide their values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this has to do with "work security".
Executives who think they lose their jobs over 3 years are 47% at national level.
The reporting staff goes to 30%.
The one of the "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of "take it or leave it", take or leave.
The directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can earn even 10 thousand dollars a month, in addition to the pension and payment of insurance.
For holidays, then, reasoning becomes complicated: all days after the first year, all after the third to reach 15 days overall after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, often get sick during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: THE COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA IS STILL GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the realtor Danilo Coppola who had asked to be moved from his city, Grottaferrata, to a home in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the Unipol-Bnl scale counterpath investigation.
In the course of the trial at his office last week, he was discharged from his domicile as an obligation of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the realtor could travel from the town of the province to a house in the capital.
However, according to the court, these movements (to which he gave an opinion against the pm) would allow him to influence his company and to access the evidence that they accuse him of it.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already emerged a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
There is a confirmation in the New York Times of yesterday informing us that the ongoing crisis is breaking up the Republican Party, increasingly divided among its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead conservative, hostile to "those in Washington" and to the world of finance, strong especially in the States of the Centre and the South.
The soul, for the most part, made itself prepotently alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
This just mentioned, however, is just one example of the changes, of the major changes, which the current economic earthquake perhaps predestins or already leaves to be seen: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not only here.
Both in the USA and in Europe the crisis seems to function as an incubator of incubator phenomena for a long time that in the new climate solidifies and finally comes to light.
The first of these phenomena is the revitalization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of state-sovereignity in relation to a sort of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of financial-banking institutions which have, yes, close links with abroad, but which first of all are very broadly involved in the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
What immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In other words, the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of play or not to have much to say: the overwhelming proof is given by the European Union which divides as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies cannot decide any common policy line.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all the provision of funds: since when you get to the close it is only the States that own the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in sixth.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which no market or international organization may possibly ever have similar resources.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized from a hint that our future would have to deal more and more with those very little immaterial things that are water, harvests, oil.
All things that, look at a little, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but are however bound in an absolute way to a restricted space, to a territory.
As for those who are to be sovereign, he certainly owns several more cards than those who are not, to those who have the misfortune to live in a place without harvests, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty, however, which predicts a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective needs authoritative leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species, turned out to be so inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And together something even deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an inoffence, an image of inadequacy, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of Western countries.
In other words, it seems to be getting more and more on the road, in large areas of the population, to believe that before their actions are the same as the ideas of the social elites so far, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall sense of the term, to have made their own time and to be increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimation of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in the sudden "revolutional" elections or in the sudden events of the collective moods of recent and recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of Labour consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congresses against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy there is something to do).
It is felt that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what has not since taken shape in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is reinvigorating, increasing, potentially stirring up.
In the face of all this talk of a 'rebellion of the masses' on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open for sure is not for nothing.
The Supertail to Walk on the Walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the aim of several American research centres and now a team of four institutions has gone very close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, the scholars were able to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
LO STUDIO – The American journal Science has published the discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of the existing ones that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the legs of the gechi, covered by microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
The tests carried out on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "get off the wall easily" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
PATH ON DEATH? -"This material may be useful as a transitional adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use like the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may concern aerospace engineering.
For the moment, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also engaged in the search for a new adhesive.
In an article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars presented a adhesive made of microfibre as hair that self-cleans themselves from dust during the movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Pharmaceuticals: never with fruit juices
Watch out for grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because seventeens and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time with some life-saving drugs alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing, depending on the case, the effectiveness with even serious health consequences.
Reiterating the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with the taking of certain medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, which since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, cancels the beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
The grapefruit juice had already been charged because it was considered responsible for increasing to levels considered toxic the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antistamine and neurological medicinal products.
RISK FARMACIES - The Italian Medicines Agency itself reported this in a newsletter two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mix and to pay attention to what they drink in case they take drugs such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY PUMPELMO - According to experts also the orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit medicines.
Along the list of active substances inhibited by the grapefruit and other juices.
From here the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan: "These discoveries are usually immediately reported to the various agencies of the international and national drug that will eventually change the informative notes of the drugs.
So always read the package leaflets for the medicines you are taking and if there is anything that is not clear, do not impress us but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification", said the expert to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Zealander who teaches at the University of Princeton and is a well-known publisher of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's foreign economic and political choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, on the days Enron failed, Krugman had foreseen in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that sparked not little controversy and that for years it was confronted with the economist, but that it has now turned out to be correct.
"I am surprised and also somewhat shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a communicator with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical against the excesses of liberism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open-source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work by volunteer developers, behind which SUN Microsystem monitors, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with different news: to the welcome screen and to the magazine interface and make it less scattered, adding other more substantial ones such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also to interoperability with the Office 2007, Open Office suite is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example for sending them by email, or the possibility of importing PDF files into the graphical processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create documents "PDF hybrids", which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene in multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the text maker, each employee is assigned a color in the comments for better recognisability at the review stage.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functionality to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English version on the mirrors since Friday.
Besides for Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request may also be sent at home or at the workplace the installation cd.
And if the theme of gratuity can be a drag for the spread of houses, it is precisely in business that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, already relying on several projects made in the public administration and in schools.
And there are also the realities that offer an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word-respective videowriting; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint Emulus presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Even Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third classed and winner of the best climber shirt.
To report the news is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner in the Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also the Gerolsteiner.
Analysis of Kohl blood samples is among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place at the Tour and will meet the two years of canonial disqualification.
To confirm Kohl's positiveness to the third generation Epo is the head of the French antidoping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positiveness.
The 26-year-old Austrians placed themselves on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the best climber's peas.
Immigrants:New YORK TIMES SHOULD, IS ITALY RAZZIST?
Italy "from the country of migrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
Is this turning the Belpaese into a nation of racists? It is what is asked in a long article the New York Times that has dedicated a long article to the debate on the subject of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what Nyt calls the "north paradox": the northern regions are at the same time the ones where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also mentioned the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
The new legislation required by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegals is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Tendenza emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI al Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of caro-rents up to 900 euros for one room
The rent market for university students knows no crisis.
According to the last survey of Sunia, the tenants' union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very serious characters to the point of excluding entire bands of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should support - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand by students has so deformed the market to trigger a process of general increase also for residents".
In most cases, rental offers then contain a series of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, without limit of fee, sub-allocations linked.
For Sonia, there is a need for extraordinary measures which, through the revision of the tax system, can reduce prices.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a place to sleep in Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Black Band area) to an average value of 800 (Lambate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Vittoria area).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed place in a double, 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are requested for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double bed.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostian and Cinecittà).
It saves only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples for one bed it takes 300/450 euros, for one room it costs from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for one bed it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rents to extra-Community students is more frequent, as in Perugia, there is finally a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the fee requested to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, cities cancel the historical halls
The historical cinemas close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinema is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore photographs effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of the large multi-salts and the consequent death by consummation of the monosals in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear inevitable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and loads of memory, "it is as if there were less a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of street and many emotions", observes the director of New Cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years made Tornatore the Oscar Prize and the Grand Prix of the Cannes Jury, and that told the poetry of a province hall and nostalgia for a way of living the lost cinema perhaps forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the main association of the practitioners, speak clearly: over the past five years, 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and paying the highest discount are mainly the rooms in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinema monosala persi, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to show that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multi-sala cinemas: 195 additional screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally", notes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec," it is useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund for the public sector: the state's pre-debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about the closures, has decided to run to the shelters with the signing of a protocol between Comune and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote monosala cinemas both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the proposed rules are tax relief measures for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for stopping and in some parking lots.
"It is an initiative that I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is certain, however, that in order to counter the excess of the multiplex traditional rooms, the quality of the sound and the image must also be improved, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Paradise Cinema", which I had thought of for 10 years already.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto or the Quirinale of via Nazionale now closed, there where I have lived so many shared emotions, so as not to see the signs blackened by the dust I turn on the other side".
Links between politics and 'drangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to uniform the choices of the Municipality to the interests of the Piromalli Cosca."
The charges are heavy that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria address the mayor and the deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in mafia association.
In hand also Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, the boss's homonym, already convicted for association for delinquer of mafia, condemned to compensate 10 million euros.
"In contempt of any legal and moral standard, as well as common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed the desire to pay advice to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been so granted to the cosca - the judges write - to officially enter the municipalities by facilitating the already large, control and address possibilities of the public administration".
The president of the regional board of Calabria Agazio Loirero is not hiding that "collusions between local authorities and organised ill-treatment are several" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'drangheta, heroes who remain clean".
This morning's arrests follow those last July with which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli shell.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved but already in 1991, and always for alleged conditions between organised crime and local administration, local politicians had been raised by the commission to administer the Commune.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, was elected to head a coalition of right-hand center, after the May 2006 ballet.
He shouted to the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called in question the then Deputy Minister of Internal Marco Minniti, accusing him of having built everything up for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest warrant signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli shell had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, they write the pm, it emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a wider group notoriously close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cosca".
When energy is born from waves now the big ones go down in the field
It is an exhausted deposit, which occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the great global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have put their eyes, and now try to put their hands, colossal like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years now and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, the research intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the environmentalist bodies and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by wave motorcycle operations.
This amount would be twice as much as the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides.
Colossi to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in Northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are increasing and among these companies have always voted on traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technologies on ocean energy - he has declared the spokesperson of a company associated with the US oil colossus to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us".
The cooperation in question relates to obtaining a permit from the US Energy Committee, which is necessary to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It is a signal not very soon, especially if it is considered that in Alaska the U.S. continue to extract oil and recently President Bush has started a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, there are the Verdant Power Inc. in New York and the Ocean Power in New Jersey to travel the way of energy coming from the sea and the sums invested so far, as not known in detail, indicate to observers an upward interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology at dawn, also because marine energy does not escape all the doubts about the environmental impact.
For now plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems to the ecosystem.
However, to produce large-scale energy, technologies must be used with greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boe connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the boe up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure drives a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through underwater cables.
For now there are four installations of this type under design, only waiting for federal approval and some of the energy could be used for military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement when there are tides spins the turbine blades, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said she has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to take advantage of energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, right now deserves the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely about the energy of the tides that have been like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others that overlook the coasts, have already invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million for 2009.
