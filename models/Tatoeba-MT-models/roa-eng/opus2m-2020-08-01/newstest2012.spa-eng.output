Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the Minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison by the alleged signing of a disadvantageous Russian agreement for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet firm, the Court of Appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there had been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code against which the former Prime Minister was sentenced was supported by 147 members of the vote.
226 votes were required for approval.
The victory of Libya
The history of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
To define who the winner is
As is already customary in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of dilucidate whether it is moderate or radical
The Transitional National Council has brought into force the traditional law, the sharia, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because thieves will be cut off.
Women can already be forgotten about emancipation and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, society, made up of warrior tribes, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya there will be an order that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and, probably, it did not suit the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters would accept grateful help from unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each successful intervention.
When they seek winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shooting of what Islamists and our politicians are using to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guaranteeing any benefits.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, locals do not have a problem expelling the "crossings"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies get to do with Libyan black gold only in good words?
It is quite possible not, but the West may eventually be able to presume to protect human rights.
Whenever the sharia followers don't cross us.
A new era of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe go hunting for the investor seeker
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the inter-quarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, today's bond market has broken records.
Investors are no longer only fixed in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data of the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (increase of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), although in France a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data were talking about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% annually in the third quarter of this year.
However, during the inter-quarterly period, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and ČSÚ believes that the trend towards gradual deceleration in economic development growth is consistent.
The results are even worse than the analysts' forecasts.
Main events:
Internationally, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but has stagnated four-monthly.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen 5.2% annually.
The interest of its ten-year bond is 28.45%.
The interest of Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problem is also affecting Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of the Czech bonds at 10 years remain at 4 per cent, although in the area the situation is getting worse.
In Germany, voices are raised saying that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
Czechs are classified for Eurocopa.
They beat 1:0 and celebrate the classification with a premium 200 million.
The football team performs the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant gatekeeper Petr Jiráček, the victory was won by 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second time, was fantastically defended against the attacks of the local team, so that it will not miss the appointment of the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the party in a thorough report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also the excellent game of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won for 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Due to the very proper Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two harmed by the party were Damjanovič and Vučinič, which allowed two great occasions to pass.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the eleven Czech will not miss the date of the European Cup, so the national football arks will receive a gratification of approximately 200 million crowns.
Since the first few minutes there has been a good offensive game.
Both teams were only committed to keeping the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, kicking the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense could avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear installations in Iran.
They wish to express their support for his country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students went to pray on Tuesday at noon in front of the facilities and then ran death slogans to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan human shields around the nuclear technology center where they work with uranium.
They want to demonstrate that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
In a recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted that Iran, according to all indications, is striving for nuclear weapons.
Israel is talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
Students began praying at noon before Isfahan's nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose objective would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be achieved, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan plant, but also the facilities of Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: not breakfast and dinner
More than one third of children aged 9-13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and obesity 5 per cent.
Obese children originate in most families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It shows again the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obsessive children are fed, for example, by sausages at least twice as often as children of families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had eaten fries the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program " Obesity is not a coincidence".
In families of overweight children, there is no practice of sports, which applies to most current families, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and took part in the same nearly 900 children of Basic Education throughout the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program of "The Obesity of Is Not a Chance", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th course.
An adequate diet and quite family exercise are determining factors, which significantly decrease the number of children with overweight and even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals per day according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, food, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," she picks up one of the survey results.
No breakfast but with a dining area
Experts warn that in healthy development, details are also important, such as having a set time for family breakfast.
In Czechia, however, only 23 per cent of schoolchildren's families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one has breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of households there is no breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children, healthy fries are consumed more frequently.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink sweet refreshments daily (70%).
In general, more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed do sports, but among their parents, this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study enabled the chosen girls (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children between 12 and 15 years of age, from the point of view of healthy nutrition, are far from ideal."
Among your favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"It is especially alarming the popularity of sweet refreshments," is advised in the final report of the study.
As the main food the palm is taken the pasta and follow closely the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject vegetables and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Switching to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive fair information.
"In the control group of the study participants, who filled in the questionnaire after the completion of the prevention programme " Obesity is not a coincidence", in many cases a major change was given in favour of the principles of healthy diet," the results of the study point out.
Call attention, for example, to sweet refreshments, where many children would begin to prefer normal and ordinary water.
Children would also choose in the questionnaire the poultry meat and fish for the main meal and would restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, support professionals
In the introductory article, How stylists learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences of three branch professionals, how to dress up problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll get worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course develops every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pinhead.
We are times studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And that's the great majority.
Someone's a cuckoo, someone's got a stylized figure without the right curves and someone's overweight.
The stylist has to know how to optically smooth wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks on how to make the body of women of the type Jennifer Lopez, of huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not wearing it in a too challenging way
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants are not adapted, it is worth sewing at least one piece of extra custom fabric.
They will certainly not repent, for the clothing that feels perfectly priceless.
With a custom skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to dress clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidered or flagged.
There are certainly many kinds of diverse and body information, so I'm glad I have all week to put all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the assigned task, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, to whom he must design two costumes: one for the day and the other for the night.
It is necessary to take into account the current aspect, the style of fashion that suits the person in question.
I've been touched to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, it's much better for me than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who recently has fattened a hundred pounds (please take into account the exaggeration), or the young Selena Gómez.
We have to cut them off the magazines or search them on the Internet and print them, and then produce them graphically.
The moodboard, which is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and relationship to graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of styleism.
The designer, therefore, did not see only physically, but also took care, for example, of the product pages in the magazines (specific topics such as trends, pockets, shelters, etc.).
We were told by the designer and designer Mario Kameník.
But all of this is by Sunday.
The designer must have a global vision.
The three guest specialists encouraged the Saturday conference with information about all types of bodies.
Fashion designer Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same dress in different ways.
The variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such gabardina (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in classics with cowboys and T-shirts, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heel shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just bend it and climb the neck to get a completely different image.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, first you need to know all the rules."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
Finally, it is clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
That's not about the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know a stylist has to have more types of clothes on the reserve he's trying to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (so, ten outfits), you have to have ready, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that photos the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All of this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style assume only, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetin have made her a world star.
In Czechia, for the time being, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of the designers.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (my abilities are enough, my physical appearance doesn't matter so much).
And when someone asks us for our services, we have to keep in mind that it is very likely that they will tell us a very different size from their real (less).
Then there is only gugling and finding out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened/slipped, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the designer not only has to focus on fashion, but has to understand outfit.
During your work, you should communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't miss them, he defends his opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify the garment and complete it with beautiful clothes, you cannot take and throw away everything there was and say, "how horrible"."
"Find at least a couple of things you can think about and recommend that someone put them on," Mario says.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit into the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the waist and all the necessary tools are available there.
They are objects like scissors, such as scissors, wipepers, or imperdibles. There are also nylon thread (which serves the designer during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special lace clamps of garments in front, if it is larger (the pins and other type of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing game.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to coat the sole of the shoes.
Even during photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, the ground could be damaged and much more the outside.
And we did nothing but cover and cover.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so we wouldn't hurt them by accident.
So he had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me joy in praising my work without reservation.
The truth is, I don't get those skills very well.
This is only a small part of all that we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that dedicating myself to stylism on a professional level is not a pink road, but it gives me exactly what people say.
En Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Review
A journey, initially unoccupied, is complicated because of a series of unwarranted neglects of a routine journey during the morning shift.
To some extent, expectations were met, but this is of no use, if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new delivery, to which The Run is added, has aroused great expectations already before its premiere.
I promised I'd blow up the old Need for Speed racing saga and, as a result, it appears as a game that shouldn't end up being once again a genre of action without more.
We are also curious to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character comes down from the car and walks through his own foot.
As is usually the case in the NFS series, the results do not vary much in terms of what we expected.
There are careers that can be taken as acceptable, but in the total calculation points are lost due to absurd failures, which have been appearing in the series for years.
Actually, we cannot even call errors, but rather the incomprehensible distancing of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career throughout America.
You sit at the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, one does not even remotely feel that the game always offers the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasant in sight, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing of the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, the races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you must be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to advance a number of rivals required (the normal one in a classic race), then try to make time (the classic timed duel) and then wait for a duel against a single opponent.
In the middle of all this the police sometimes appear, which only makes things even harder.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are quite fewer landscapes in the game than might be expected (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the footprints of previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big deal, but you can't say it's bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race designed with a lot of action suits this style of driving quite well, although we can find something better between the games of competition.
So far, everything's in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the collisions are no longer the same.
Of games of this kind you can't expect it to create complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you can't predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that, by making a very adjusted advance or circulating the car with a normal traffic, there are only slight rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or it's completely destroyed.
Thanks to the restorative system, there are no big problems, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or get off the track, the game returns you to the last point of rescue on the track.
However, in each race there are only five resets available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's no more than a help in case something goes wrong, but it's not much to trust.
Sometimes, not resecting helps, only helps you learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, one must enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself in some place "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or you arrived five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry above all in situations, when you see that two cars that go to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent moves forward without any problems, but when you get there, you have to turn or either slow down.
It is the same when you arrive, because it is programmed that the "surprise" will always happen in front of your nose.
Opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, regardless of the moment, the same opponent will always advance you in the same place.
This also happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes ahead of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming from the front, so at first you can make the car tick.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will certainly disappoint you immediately.
And it's a shame, because even if the travel model is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it's often not possible to follow the detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn't matter, if merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the classification in the race so that it doesn't break boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is changing cars during the races.
You have to keep an eye on the gas station next to the road, because right there you have to switch cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will have enough of what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and over-sport exotics for technical driving, for example, by mountain roads with curves.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know about the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
By reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog function is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you arrive to the subway tunnel (pass), where you start to run in darkness along the tracks (pass).
The speed meter marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, behind you comes the metro convoy and it takes you in front of you no more.
In the drafting we will certainly have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one even thought a little or if the real authors take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even superb.
What a pity it is that, in the most tense moments, image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to be of pleasure to most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and his mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confused.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game in recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not finished.
The fun is assured, but prepared because the mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the force of some airport reflectors.
The choirs of the Carolina University will participate in the concert "Third Students".

Ambassador to the EU, Vice-Nová:
Czechs have a reputation for negatists and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I wasn't expecting a war without barracks."
"It will take five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles," the Czech Ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law with conviction.
How not to take seriously your "clear and openly about Europe" motto, which he already said at the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each body of the EU and its relations with such accuracy and clarity, as it would be the envy of many lecturers from the U. Carolina Faculty of Law.
Vice-Nová also pushed the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first comes from criticism, that if it is insulible, a gray official, able to assume any role, but I must say that he left everyone bewildered, because he assumes his roles to perfection."
"It is a man who knows how to listen to members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new position of representative of the Foreign and Security Policy is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union towards States such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us Olomouc's cheese
Vice-Nova has also taken up the agenda, followed and followed by the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs took care of the emerging economic crisis, solved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Czechia.
Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good shock", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being addressed.
On the other hand, the seven-year budget of the EU, caused by the current economic situation, must be approved, much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, what sectors will be given priority, which countries will receive greater support and which countries will receive less? That is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Europe: "About Europe clearly".
"The truth is, I don't like the ugly abbreviations, the alienisms, or the jargas that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not truly invented curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes, or that no one is going to ban the cheese of Olomouc?"
It also aims to make more use of the EU's environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people perceive rather the negative aspects than the positive ones.
He also regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame lies with many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivating messages, but also the limited support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"When a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and I'm approached by a Slovak, a Frenchman next to me says, "What, you've got left, those of the Visegrad Group?", and it's not funny."
In the future, the EU, according to Vice-Nová, is awaiting new tough budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that only the countries they want and those who do not, who stay away, cooperate."
"These procedures will be more and more and will strengthen Europe at both speeds," Vice-Nova is expected.
In this regard, he also stressed the role of Czechia and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle that all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed among the Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone looked for a term that would define IBM's strategy with great precision, the closest would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as present and, however, has already gone one hundred years since its foundation.
The basis of this long-term character was put by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his seal, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised company culture.
"For us, IBM implies a long-term thought, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fearing the changes around it.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even further in our second century," said the current director of the Samuel J. Palmisano company during his anniversary.
A fancy system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the businessman of Ba the Czech Republic (the employees of IBM were the first U.S. workers who enjoyed paid holidays, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps it IBM in the relationship with the customer.
Already from the beginning the company was able to discover talents (as one of the first world companies to eliminate any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, for which Palmisano will replace it next year a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working for 30 years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
In recent years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, rain of online ideas, from which infinity of future strategies and innovations emerge.
It is not surprising that ideas emerge, because almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"Since the beginning IBM has maintained a concept of an institution rather than a technological enterprise," says the economist professor at Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users," says George Colony of Forrester Research consultant.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering into the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as is known in the United States familiarly because of its logo, has become the last 100 years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (developments both equipment, programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It has the largest number of patents in all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include automatic cashier, payment cards, financial exchange, bar codes and diskettes.
IBM will bill this year $220 billion. This year has become the second technological firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the Future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or PCjr IBM computers).
"If your business is based on moving forward, it cannot be emotionally anchored in the past," recognized Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they don't work, abandon them).
And that's the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically stays and falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one fifth are programs and another fifth of equipment.
However, even in 1990 the teams accounted for more than half of the suppliers' share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets for a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when for the first time the modern global financial crisis was manifested.
IBM acts according to the premise of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that IBM has so far been able to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM’s shares since the beginning of 2008 has increased stratospherically to 120%, the net profit of the company has not ceased to increase.
The currency of IBM is to change everything except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
History of IBM: from cheese cutter to space flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was already adopted in 1924 - originally a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis for the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
It had inventions such as the famous "watch to watch", which allows to control the entry and exit of the employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired his supervisory council until 1930.
Flint appointed the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM ( Watson's ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are supported).
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business equipment, from meat cutters and cheese to register boxes.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, billing doubled to $9 million and began the great expansion of the company across the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost 40 years later, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM personnel and computers helped NASA to guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classics "pecés", which established the computer standard of that time, arrived at the market with the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer full advice and high value added services.
The strategy that has paid IBM over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet".
Its objective is to make more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned and circumstances have not been improved, for example, with regard to transport and city administration.
For the trade sector, IBM presented not long ago the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the full business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in the then Czechoslovakia, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic centre for outsourcing in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Here too, there is a world-famous research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina was still hoping that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can go home, but not like my partner anymore," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová welcomed Bartošové in her house during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after the song and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even fired him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not expect him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our home, no one will throw him away."
"But here I would live no longer as my dear old borchia who got wrong, but as a man to whom I join certain ties," Rychtářová said and added that he had already disengaged his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef so far doesn't care that he's got his wife locked the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife set this up as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company remains in force, I make home arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I make purchases."
"Darina and I talk normally, the only thing is that we don't share bed," said Rychtář.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he wouldn't object.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't interest me, where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," concludes Josef.
The worst vices of women: Are they also referring to you?
If you asked men to be able to quote some typical vices of women, each of them will usually name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that can boil the blood to men?
Skip shopping
Do you blame your orange average who is dependent on the purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one trip a week?
Do you like to buy often on the discounts?
Then in your case you can say that going shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to walk around the clothes shops all the time, find well-adjusted clothes and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women to go shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically a hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner that you'd better wait in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"Should I have to slime at least five kilos--should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't you hear these phrases?
To what?
So she's one of those women obsessed with her looks.
It is not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to listening to your partner complain all the time about your physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of complaints, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning in the first place
It's like an infinite tiovive.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, scrub the floor, remove the dust, rub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, for his children who have dirtyed a freshly cleaned toilet and a shelf with glass doors that cost him so much to clean?
In case you suffer this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness surely should not be the primary concern in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make Disgusting Comments
"The socks used are left with the dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too."
"The wet rag is not left on the ground!"
If he makes those comets to his couple more times a day, he knows he'll be able to get it out of his boxes.
Of course. You don't mean anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Slanders and jokes
Some women also go to slander, gossip, but also to insults and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, who, how, and why.
At best each of us sometimes escapes a small and harmless chism.
With the hand in the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are funny women who don't control themselves, whom they love to whisper and often do, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially on a women's work team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assistance to defeat Philadelphia
The Jaromír Jágr hockey forwarder participated on Monday in the NHL meeting with two assistances that brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 in Carolina court and put Czech players back in the vanguard of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's play, and took one more step and was declared the party's best player.
Two attendances were awarded in the party and Jágr's colleague, Jakub Voraček.
After the meeting, Jágr said to overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"Before the party I had told him I would triple."
"I'd present it."
"Sometimes they seem ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance had given Giroux a goal, following the first flyers stroke.
A while later, the team's second intervention also had a Czech trail.
Voráček was made with the album behind the Hurricanes portery and moved it between the circles until Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first pause a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr, he scored the third goal, after his shot was fired at Wayne Simmonds' room.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the field, but he's definitely among the three best," Jágr weighted his center.
"I would never have thought that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I'm very pleased with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years at the NHL, my companions played for me, and that now produces results," Jágr adds.
Carolina still turned the party into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again of Dwyer, of penalti, even to a goal of distance.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up outnumbered by two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"She released the record, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to hit the record and I'm glad I got it," Voraček described the game's last goal as he lived.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the party against Buffalo, in the second third he withdrew for an injury at the top of the body.
The Canadians not only lost a player with a lot of defence experience, but also by a two goal difference, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec was unable to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and playing the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were new."
"Finally, but it's just that nothing can be done about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"As far as rotating players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the record out of our field."
"And so we leave blanks," explained one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
Porter Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the victory of 5:2 on the Tampa Bay.
Jets' goals were marked by five players who ended a series of defeats that already lasted five matches.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold travel only to the socialist bloc in most cases, as travels to the West were very restricted.
The Czech tourists therefore went on vacation to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, then the Yugoslav regime leaned westward and the travels of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (that is, also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually not even by the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies offered trips to the West in those days, but one had to line up with a sleeping bag and spend all night, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Still, it wasn't all won.
The so-called "change promise" which was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable person", who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without guarantee of change, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of summer cottages and houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The way of traveling from the Czechs has had a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was not going to be the holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria anymore, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, the fact that the current favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989, could not be travelled freely, because it was part of the Yugoslavia of that time.
In the early 1990s, visa exemption was imposed to travel to neighbouring Western European States, causing a huge wave of short-term visits, particularly to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, didn't see any maps of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech groups were sleeping in the parks in the tents, as our income from that time did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs at that time was taking with them the food (conservations, stuffed, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of Czech crown convertibility, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy free Western currency.
Our standard of living increased, and with it also average wages, which about 1997 resulted in an increase in travel demand.
With increased travel demand the agencies began, from 1997 onwards regularly, to prepare trips using charter flights connections, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts by the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 90th century, the Czechs were already travelling without visa to almost all the developed countries, except the United States, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists have been leaving each year, making countries distant and warm. This winter will be flying directly from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries currently visit about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States eliminated visas for Czech tourists, so our country became among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent more than 15,000 Czech crowns per head abroad, including expenses on the site of stay.
Called Ordinary General Assembly to elect the President, who could end up dead again.
For almost five months Czech football has been without president and it is likely that Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the call of the next Extraordinary General Assembly to take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you will not be able to vote even to choose between the three candidates.
The Czech football players are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned from office in June not without convening his colleagues for the purpose of finding a strong person who knows how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the Hašek era, a dispute arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evidenced on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
Delegates from the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dŠm), located in the Pragese district of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not just about the method of choice.
There was no consensus on who in the General Assembly was entitled to vote - only legal representatives or delegates with full powers.
From that moment on and due to this single point, a partial agreement was reached, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, the electoral code disputes remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be shed by the Executive Committee which, in its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically resolved nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has already changed a couple of times, but the neural point remains the same.
The question is: how do we proceed in the third round to avoid the dead spot?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of FAČR, who, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, the third round will win the candidate with the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will apply.
The Moravia Region is ready to reach a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have a majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of the bicameral system", so is Svoboda's understanding of the objections of the living part, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
It is surprising that Tomaš Paclík also agrees, although the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are supposed to be more appropriate to Pelta.
"I would like to see a maximum vote in accordance with the statutes."
"In order not to invent any nonsense about representatives as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who for the first time applied as a candidate and directed his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be appeased with today's party of our national team at the European Championship.
"Football will again be the protagonist, and so it will be more cooperative," said the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in managing football, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
"I hope you come to an agreement, but unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"It's not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moors, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"I hope the common sense will be imposed anyway," Rajchl said.
There is no longer much time left for all parties to come to an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the party starts if the football team is complete?
The special aircraft, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning for technical problems in Prague, having to seek an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting could at last be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which they say will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the most powerful sports organization in the country for an agreement to be reached.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) that will try to provide a new address to Czech sports after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight for the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the footballers of Pilsen, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of an appropriate candidate who satisfied all his ideas on the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not be presented as a candidate for such a relevant post.
"If there was an appropriate person, I would be fighting for her and I wouldn't be running for election."
"But to this day you have not been able to find such a person," Paclík said for the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to get into the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged election winner, who opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, if he did win, he would remain in the office of president until 2013, when the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In this position you would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
"I've already spoken to some people I might consider."
"It was crazy for me to hear some say that right now they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," he adds.
What is supposed to be the most disturbing to Paclík right now is Pelta's relationship with the President of Pilsen Roman Berbr's Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"If he wins, the current status will be maintained and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will benefit even less," Paclík said.
It also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a telephone listening during the investigation of a corruption case, of which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us," Paclík said, who also takes with some caution his previous statement that "he would sell the Club Pilsen if Pelta becomes president."
In the case of winning Thursday's elections, Paclík could be raised cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Similarly, it is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine, for example, as head of representation."
"but not as manager of an association."
"I don't even put my noses in there where I don't feel able," Paclík added, who in September gave much attention to supporting the suspension of the Arbitration Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
It draws on its management capabilities of private companies, since last summer it has also been the Director of Pilsen, who, with his support, celebrated the triumph in first division in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies to Spartan President Daniel Křetinký.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders to devote more money to the lottery tax sport.
"It is one of the key problems that the new president should devote to."
"If the taxes on gambling, as announced by political parties, would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to stop," he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR must be "not a supporter".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla in Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense of giving in hypocritically my shares of the Pilsen Club to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised FAČR new statutes that would end the deadlock of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, in the event of election, it would ensure that FAČR had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve disputes with respect to electoral regulations in the future.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about this Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Prior to the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, in case of election, on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate in the last minute at the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement might be good for him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
"People of all levels are already taking care of football a long time ago and expect to meet the new President this Thursday."
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association," says the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked on Sparta and the Association's executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, the General Assembly in June approved the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the re-adaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a tool for winning delegates.
"If I'm elected president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to respond if this fails."
"It is a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
Besides, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
He had already warned in the past that he was working with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first Vice-President.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not leave him headlong.
"It's been over a year in the football world, and it's already achieved some successes."
"His attacks but they were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That is why many of them doubt about their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who continues to be faithful to the statements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from lower competitions to higher ones.
The latter should be a football promotion window.
"Likewise, I would try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal of last year."
"I would immediately be involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," ČTK told the 46-year-old candidate two months ago.
He also promised that his appointment as football president would not result in any personal changes to the staff.
"I should first know the tasks of each employee," he said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios before the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader," two days before the most decisive day in its career as a representative, Pelta continues to be optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, FAČR would begin to work eagerly.
If current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl was elected in the Fourth General Assembly as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would certainly be reluctant.
Rajchl promises that if he was chosen, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make executive committee members accountable for each football area individually.
It is also committed to resolving the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I'd like to devote myself to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, through professional football or the training of young high-performance footballers."
"With this I don't mean that I would do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the executive committee's powers so that each member can devote himself to a specific area."
"And I'll assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move on with a lot of momentum."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not re-approaching itself as a candidate.
"Everyone knows that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent and hinder me in every step," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"Many people have told me that I must not give up, because then they would be given to defeating others as well."
"It's about having faith not to give up like this, just like that," he said.
They say it also motivates you to continue the work that has already begun with Hašek.
"During those two years, a large part of the work was over that I don't want you to lose now."
"There are processes that have begun and will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like someone to father them," he announced concerned that, if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be as it was before Hašek's time.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is above all all those people who would take care of football so that it would be only a privilege for a few elect."
"I may be reproached for a lot of things, but not for the fact that I'm in favour of someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because that's the only way they'll feel good and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind doing the most for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech part and another dwelling, whose winners would go into the first division."
"The current situation in which we have only three teams from Moravia would not be given, which represents a problem for young Moravia players," Rajchl said.
Even though Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, was supported by the presidential elections, Rajchl continues to believe in his ability to be elected.
"I still feel strongly supported by the Czech Federation, which has elected me as its vice president and who knows that there are clear successes behind me," Rajchl said, whose successes include the saving of some tens of millions of crowns of disadvantaged contracts, the negotiations on television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law.
On the other hand, he recognizes his share of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "unqualified to regain confidence in Czech football", he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already begun and would not significantly change the staffing of the staff in the committees."
"I don't want to use that for me," he evaluates his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Blue jump
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an amazing view, sumptuous bathrooms in Budapest: Anyone who visits Europe can live their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip last year and a half, there was something that could not be missed in his luggage, a bather.
Falled back over the water, looked at the art dome on the top, swam towards the marble angelots, who waited at the edge of the pool and marveled at the modernist indoor pool restored meticulously.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder explored over 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in his recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "constructions of concrete" in Taunus.
He made his "travel through the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of the bathroom culture.
He doesn't want to have anything to do with sports, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers you that bathing enthusiasts have to conform to blue tiles and chlorine-hodor, while racing enthusiasts can breathe the fascinating smell of fir forests or listen to the happy trins of birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools have to be so ugly," said this Viennan resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles architecture.
The hat in the pool and ethereal sauna oils. The wellness factor in the pools is so great because all senses are cared for, according to Meder.
And if the builder tries, the covered pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of the floor, in the bathrooms there is a water surface."
"On the one hand it's transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything folds optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data about architecture and the history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but mainly, it gives a desire to jump to blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding examples in his research in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bathroom in Budapest, there are the waters with nitrates in a singular karstic cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some thermal baths, whose pools are alkaline waters and are in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termalfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city puts its eyes on the roofed Zurich pool, you can look at Arlberb, snow cover, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bathroom in St. Anton, and: There is a window in the Turkish bath from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary, awaits customers in Längenfeld: The Ötztal Water Cathedral looks like an ovni that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources rise steam in winter, while in the background the Ötztal mountains rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
A Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the baths of Árpád in Békscsaba, Hungary, the gas oil pest is so strong that people think they have come to a toilet.
The smell comes from medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legamo is glued to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for beautiful bathing places, when he wanted to visit discovered swimming pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, he found himself with a blocked plot.
The 1902 bathroom by architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the demoralized windows of the modernist building red, white and yellow, he saw the weeds grow among the tiles.
The decadence stood in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction after themselves; not only can you discover neo-nomic elements of construction times in 1844, but also an Alhambra-style Arab hall, added in 1900.
Since its major modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural of the Black Forest.
"It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," Meder says.
In a palace like this, immersion in the thermal pool seems to be of little importance.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the raw materials business
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank renounce its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to verify the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, it is clear from a study that 84 percent of Germans do not think it is acceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a survey by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that global raw material stock bets raise prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer advocate's campaign is specifically directed at Josef Ackermann, director of the Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were designed to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that players have disapplied offers and demands, and make profits from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticisms differently than the US competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "deserves the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the demands of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis must be completed at the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Directive, together with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticisms of the financial sector: "The rising food prices bets show particularly drastic how ruthless banks are currently damaging public welfare."
Ackermann is the largest banking hub, especially in terms of obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts the money at stake for food price bets," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with people who are starving or the Deutsche Bank's fame."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first sight, but it's clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different than not planned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation you can perfect your image.
And he needs you to hardly care for any losses, that's what your successor will take care of.
Two thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep pressure on the manager high.
So far, over 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 per cent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were waged.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes from agricultural speculation.
43 percent would disclaim such a bank to its acquaintances, 49 percent would request, after reflection, cancel their account and switch to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The Pavilion Moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights and a happy ending, the pavilion of the Austrian universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and collapsed.
It now reopens as a exhibition house.
The modern post-gerra architecture passionately, the clear forms, the glass halls, the brave curves and the new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is an appropriate and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then obtained the Architecture Grand Prix for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
Construction is considered to date a contemporary milestone of architecture.
He made the architect so well-known that he also built the Austrian pavilion in the following universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent building flattened in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, rose after the universal exhibition at Schweizer Garten next to the southern station of Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and a 20th-century museum was inaugurated called "House 20".
The building was suitable but lacked the proper spaces and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, not a good environment.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and decays more and more.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now calls it "home 21" and will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
On Tuesday afternoon the museum belvedere was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery since 2007, has achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic skater on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founder of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation should be exhibited, there should be a café and a library and also a office building.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only did he make a significant reform of Joseph Olbrichs' secession in Vienna, it expanded and he was awarded the competition, but he studied with Schwanzwer at the Vienna Technical University and the pavilion was for him a "great and important place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was "an energy eater," said Krischanitz.
The profile of the glass facade windows was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced with a special safety glass.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a panel of light coming down between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in ancient shades of caoba and protected against oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly the way it was before.
And all this with strict control by the office of monuments and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office," Krischanitz says and warns of a rough soil in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The flag "which came from Brussels" has been difficult, said recently Krischanitz, a typical "accidental appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that's why I wanted to "raise the right conscience."
In this case the 21st is not in the wrong place, there has been a hit of urban luck. The totally new and planned "central station neighborhood", with houses and offices, is located next to Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck happens: House 21 could receive a reinforcement from another construction of Krischanitz, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as you hear, negotiate with the city over a nearby place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that amounts to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid the wreckage of the trains in winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
Which costs millions.
Deutsche Bahn spent more than EUR 70 million this year in the fight against the damage and delays caused by winter trains, according to a journalistic report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the planned investments up to 2005 of a total of around 300 million euros.
For what better availability of vehicles and the railway network should be achieved even at an extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from the tracks and from the Andes.
The aim is to clean snow and ice and 90 per cent of the needles required for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train crashes and delays also during this winter after a government and industry summit.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of travellers, as, among other things, he lacked reservations to adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for authorization from the Federal Railway Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axes of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the breaking of an axis in the central station of Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays millionaire fines in the United States
After the tumult over President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem appears, Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the United States acquires the sector giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (EUR 120 million) in an agreement, to end the contents due to the bankruptcy of five large credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgage securities.
The NCUA financial market regulator recriminates to many large banks inducing credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimised the risks.
These titles lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to the courts," said a spokesman for the Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of NCUA, welcomed the deferral of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides support in case of bankruptcy to protect customer investment.
NCUA is seeking to reintegrate the losses of millions of origin.
The agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also called for accounts from other large banks and in summer filed disputes against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, these are the so-called mortgage-backed values.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble exploded in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial entities.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, today a complicated wind is blowing for U.S. banks.
Investors and the inspection have engaged in countless processes for receiving compensation or sanctioning faults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of claims.
Reproduces to the 18 large international banks that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has a demand for FHFA, which is $14.2 billion in business from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, invests strongly in the IBM Information Technologies company.
Since March it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared no investment in computer companies or Information Technology since long-term business development forecasts are negative.
But he has read IBM's trade report and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
It should have been understood long before IBM offers mainly services and seeks computer systems for the Information Technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive of Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett currently unveiled in the CNBC economy station that has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment has promoted to one of the largest IBM shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the compromise so far.
He commended the leadership that dealt with regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has long established profitable information technology services such as the operation of calculation centres.
The old computer pioneer over 100 years old also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose business he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion on a freight train, in a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and, with wise investments, expanded it to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet, his life - style is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors all over the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname "Omaha's Oracle".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM stock in stock exchange rose by one percent.
"The blue giant", as IBM is known, has a stock value of more than $220 billion and figure, together with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is a close friend.
The threat is taken into account
After the discovery of "Zwickau's cell", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that relives itself.
The murders of eight small trick and Greek entrepreneurs between 2001 and 2006 have a background on the far right.
Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have responded with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin returns a ghost that was thought dead long ago, since the fire-like attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of violence with extreme right-wing background against the Turks had occurred.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The exposed ultra-rightst network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
"Does the bloody ideology relive again?", titled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out, on the contrary, that one of the perpetrators was an informant at the Federal Office for the Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-rightst landscape.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil to the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin along with the German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn event of the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The cohabitation was staged in joyful colors, like a happy ending story.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap: "The German Gift for the Fiftieth Anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" also insists on tracing this mental connection.
"It starts to smell bad," says Ahmet Külahci's column title.
He stressed that the assassins were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, police behaviour and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not long looked for suspects in the circle of the ultra-right.
Some are less rhetorical about the drastic means: "From now on immigrants are lost, only self-defense and armament remains."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Germany's internal peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network," writes Selen.
This means that, if Germany's internal peace is in danger, the Mölln and Solingen attacks will be clarified in 90 years.
The image of the ruins of Solingen's fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks who live here that there is a specific threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks aggravate the group feeling of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press then criticized mainly the weakness of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the Mölln survivors.
After the fire-shaped attack by Solingen sent a telegram of condolences to Turkish President Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks of Germany contribute with taxes.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media shows again how deep it is, since then, the mistrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and an overestimation of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The Lake Zurich scandal bank
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost broke into the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now she's headed by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the Federal Bank Summit in July, it was known that in 2013 he would begin in a new and almost equally spectacular work: Chairman of the board of the Swiss large bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly glad, praise Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired solidity and lets you drop kind comments about your future companions.
"The USB has achieved revitalization."
"I am pleased to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it was clear that everything would be totally different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all bank security systems and failed 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, director general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the administrative board of the USB has since been considered equally touched, and they all asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber will have to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will be in charge of the chair of the Administrative Board in May, not in early 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but a professor of economics and counsellor and has had a period of definitely necessary adaptation.
Suddenly he is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just re-proven that he deserves the title "the biggest bank in the scandal of Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it looks like, is saved the old so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss asset manager discreet and solid, but also handy, was combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 billion, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the big banks of the world.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later banker teacher in Zurich for many years explains: "In front of my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one asks: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007, something went very badly on the USB.
In mid-year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a great and very smart banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund embarked on high-risk securities losses and had to amortize billions.
To charge with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course, that some had looked with contempt until just before: an Asian and opaque state fund of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 at the second best paid administrative council in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic values from the UBS for many billions, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billion francs for an obligatory convertible bonus, through which it became the bank's co-ownership.
All Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic results of Switzerland (see chart).
"We can't rescue the UBS again," said Geiger, bank expert.
The first disaster was joined by the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and showed willingness to deliver data from wealthy customers, who had possibly been taxed with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, refunding unwarranted profits from these businesses with payment compensation.
In doing so, the UBS confessed more or less to have helped with tax fraud.
Simultaneously he lost something that had always been his capital in competition by wealthy customers: the discretion aureola.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This followed the resignation of the chairman of the Board of Directors and the chairman of the Administrative Board.
And the exodus of customer funds.
In this way, in a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank through mis speculation and in the administration of goods by aiding tax fraud.
And just when it was a little quieter again, just when it was thought that the UBS would get it again, this wretched operator story happened, an individual operator failed 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, that this still does not work well with risk management in the investment bank.
"The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economy and finance at the Zurich University Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also safe: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not dominate the risk controls".
Hence the idea of precaution, with which the Swiss bankers had long been present, to be the guardians of the world's greatest assets: no risk too great, instead, the security of money wants to break across the Alpine Republic.
The Swiss banks' security deposits were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of the Swiss solid private bank, it is just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main seat on the Bahnhofstraße Street in Zurich, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here there are jewelry such as Tiffany`s between traditional Swiss businesses such as Sprüngli confectionery.
Here Swiss banks have been residing for years: from the national bank, through the building of Credit Suisse, to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS through a heavy rotating door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the bank logo there is a large sign to indicate "security".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point moved the idea of the great Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank feels.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both large banks.
The UBS has become too big, it feels, mainly in the investment bank, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And for a long time they have become accustomed to the customs of Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, handed over its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial entity had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was obvious.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The Crash of the UBS" in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the large bankruptcy bank.
How do you feel about them?
They talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks were merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too large for little Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to make the two different UBS precursor banks complementary: a rich but sleeping bank with the center of the property administration in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks arrived in a timely way with a lot of money, with which they could make a big financial bike run.
There are two names related to this rise in the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive that managed to open up step from learning at the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: Disappointment arrived before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the directors' meetings, where Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Get Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps worked out for him.
In the foreign exchange operations and in the trading of shares it was at the highest.
However, business advisers in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the banking language "fixed in", there is huge compensation for large banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Greedy for growth, they invested the same bank as one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It was transformed into a powerful machine to hold American mortgage credits and sell them below, maintaining certain risks to its own account.
And also, like other banks sought the drop for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," said Geiger, bank expert.
So great is euphoria, so deep is the fall.
One manager had to leave, as the attempt to order proved more complicated than they expected.
The UBS posts have become projectable seats and are insecure to date.
At present, who runs a large bank, has almost impossible work.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment bank, concentrate on the administration of goods, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get that far (yet).
But the investment bank must decrease a lot, it is now clear.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swizo was thought to be a transitional solution, as the bank separated surprisingly from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed himself: He must permanently run the UBS business, communicated the Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Removes 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is definitely asking at the moment.
So far he's only saying he'll first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

Smart stripes spread in cities
In many places fats are considered "problem birds": they do not expel these very intelligent animals from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some people like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly, the fats have been in the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors are accumulated by the rubbish and the noise of the animals.
Although no means has appeared against the "problem birds" so far.
The fats are no longer out of the cities, say the experts at the first symposium on fats in Leer, East Frisia.
There specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to migration from the field of certain protected fats; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end up with traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, growing edification and falling trees that host them make life difficult for birds.
The fats are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding couples in Soest, Westphalia, among others in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project for mass killing of the district's fats jumped to negative media headlines.
Critics have described the hunting of animals by trappings for birds and killing with sticks as particularly brutal.
"Expulsing them and driving them normally does not get anything," said Werner Klöver, urbanist and landscaper of Leer.
Shooting the nests with water or throwing the trees is usually unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert at Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals are diverted, the large colonies of divide and distribute elsewhere."
Running them alone is imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we don't catch them anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
A combination of escape is possible from animals in sensitive residential areas and onions to re-enter elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against in order to treat animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a peak on the face with aplomo."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on Ascheberger's fats, where signers report on the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticism of bird noise: "All are forms of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the fats not only take advantage of the resources to access a few sketches, but they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, etologists at Cambridge University checked in four steps to where the intelligence of birds comes.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they should drop a stone on a platform to reach a pollen larva.
Without much training, they resolutely recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the fat astutes had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a polylarva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with the peak.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the bucket in the tube shooter.
Three of the four fats got it in the first attempt.
Portugal at Eurocopa 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and Turks have no hope for the championship.
The favorites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the Eurocopa 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed the latest Eurocopa 2012 tickets in the play-offs in Poland and Ukraine.

The former professional of the Bundesliga, Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) cut distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic obtained a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South African world play-offs.
At the Stadium da Luz de Lisboa, Portugal began in a perfect way.
Ronaldo executed a free direct from over 30 meters to get to the head at the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her dowries to score from afar and got the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not shine in the first half hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to the gleaming Edin Dzeko.
The former player of the Wolfsburg team, leader of the English Manchester City, sent a head to the pole, but the ball did not cross the carrier line (33.).
Jiracek right for the Czech Republic
Then Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was in the hurricane's eye.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark pitted a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Centralero, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the European vice-champion in 2004 clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt in the 81st minute with the goal of Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion is ranked fifth consecutively for the Eurocopa.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Bundesliga Legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction at the initial stage.
At the last moment, the porter Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal at the very door of Tomas Sivok (9).
Montenegro had more possibilities with the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic marked in the 40th minute of the front turn, very right in the Cech door.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the width of the world-famous doorman, the FC Seoul front again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the match.
In the meantime, Turkey enjoyed the wonder of Zagreb’s football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that the national coach Guus Hiddink should leave his seat on the 2002 world third-party bench, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation at the end of the Eurocopa.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a dream principle.
In the 7th minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to play the post. The attacker Kazim Kazim was not able to send the ball inside the door.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly assumed control.
After the break, Croatia did not allow him to have any goals.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the minute 62. took place Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapatoni goes to Eurocopa
In Dublin, the Irish are celebrating their first participation in the Eurocopa since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who triumphed with the 4-0 in the party prepared for a previous decision, took the lead at the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) empathized with the invited team.
Ireland pressed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had his first great chance.
From the very first moment, the defense has been avoiding possible goals of advantage.
But in minute 32. He put it in advance.
After a defense by Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, getting 1-0.

Massacre at personal level
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Pain of the Battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about the First World War, "begins with a long dramatist character of the type that can cause one to fall one's soul at his feet.
Here are some action tips: Start this page gently and convert it into your brand pages.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr Englund's novelist narrative, and this dramatic personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, like one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which rightly describes as "a work of anti-history".
It contains some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists, or discussions about tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, it explains, as "a book about how it happened." It discusses "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and pain of battle" combines the experiences in times of war of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from school and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative personnel.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, become mad or die.
Their lives blink here as votive candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mix while others are turned off.
Mr Englund's book is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also a remedy to the notion that World War I was only the terrible trenches war on the western front.
"The beauty and the pain of battle" moves expertly through other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on the hives; one passes Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intretable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
War floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina who stinks of corditousness.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's at home with your children, are you staying or running away?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost nobody understands what's going on, not even why you have to fight this war.
"Fair of facts," observes Mr Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The Beauty and Pain of the Battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
Their stories have been obtained in most of their memories, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives can be frightening or touching, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and to settle them with what is there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says: "Sucedans, everywhere successors."
"Coffee substitute, false aluminum, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about successive food in Germany.
Describes "meat made from rice cooked and pressed in beef fat (and finished with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made of roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, notes, "837 permitted substitutes for meat in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards wildling and expresses his own about war: "You feel that, after all, this is for what men are designed and not to sit in armchairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that that this varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that flogged and tarnished fence."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will find out or care.
"Once one resigns to the thought of sacrificing himself, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public," he writes.
On the other hand, it is horribly similar to "a convicted person being strangled in secret."
Other comments are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become more and more an economic competition," writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories."
Reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the livestock of the young century: The killer in eloquent mass and ideologically convinced with clothes of good clothing that runs his butcher's while sitting behind a desk".
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both innocent and heroic behavior.
Mr Englund speaks of the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way of escaping service in the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the trade of gonochic pus, which soldiers buy and embroider with it their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often gives rise to a blind for life."
In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, it reflects the way in which war has "devoted exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels like No News in the front of Erich María Remarque, rather than comprehensive stories.
Mr Englund's volume is attached to an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he'd come from his book, ripped that page of dramatist persona from your fingers, and burned it with a cherry.
After a false step before, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing anti-distortion helmets.
The night was chosen from Monday to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept in secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, and his presence emphasized how the operation was facing challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as spray spraying pepper on the demonstrators, breaking the rules of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "okupas".
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of demonstrators revealed itself after two weeks of planning and training.
Officers had prepared to see how occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster simulation was taking place in Randalls Island, with one eye staring at Zuccotti.
Officers increased the so-called training of riots - counter-terrorism measures that involved mobilizing rapidly a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park came in the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
"The few cops I know were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On 14 October, agents wanted to clear the park, but quit when hundreds of demonstrators emerged before time after hearing about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved agents from several police units, including special forces throughout the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who used to flood neighborhoods with high crime rate.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do so when the smallest number of people were in the park," he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with focussed and loudspeakers gathered on the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The pre-recorded lights and messages resounding from the speakers seemed to intimidate many demonstrators.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their clear blue shortwinds, many demonstrators simply picked up their things and left.
No store was touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving the protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen meeting in the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon him.
Paul J. Browne, the Chief Spokesman of the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they tried to prevent the police from getting into action in the park, and that they had been harshly treated by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense tide of the demonstrators' personal effects, including luggage and bags of paper and plastic waste packed with clothes, the Department of Cleanliness team followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A central group of demonstrators took positions near the camp kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police went in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were intertwined by their arms.
And two people chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency service officers were called to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The clearance operation was complete about 75 minutes later, said the police.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were "change in public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the senior officer uniformed in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of detectives in the department, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while he was there, "he wasn't running operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents expected along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
They stood barricaded on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From these positions, the police were seen extending the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the north perimeter.
Some of the most noisy action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking off the air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protestor were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will sue the city for dismissals
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The demand is possibly the last weapon available to the union, of the municipal district 37, in its efforts to revoke the dismissals.
Sixty-seventy-two school assistants, the coordinators of parents and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on 7 October, in a movement that trade union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, the city's access to a health care fund from working groups to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied that accusation.
At a hearing at the City Council last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said that dismissals were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council countered by saying that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the school support staff would be dismissed.
Municipal officials 37 said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that he would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official submission of the application, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The demand will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the city as accused, and has eight workers dismissed as claimants, all black or Latin women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the City's Legal Department, said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in the city's poor-area schools to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, as they had been undersubsidised chronically.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. District budget 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way in which it calculates additional funding for each enrollment per poor student in schools.
The union also states that the principals of secondary schools may have been fooled by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" more often describes the act of transferring a school's paymaster to a work bag, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parents' coordinators were dismissed," says the draft of the complaint, "and not just in excess."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All it needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muamar el Gadafi to be captured and murdered and for the participation of the United States to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat by Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and US troops for their "valency".
"This resolution is to honor the braves of Libya, when they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a statement of bipartisan support for its democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has so far been easy.
This summer, the legislators of both parties fought with each other and with the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and it never came to vote in the Senate.
But the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the camera also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for US operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory - with Congress quite annoying enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not as angry as actually to harvest the grass under his feet.
The Congress's indecision was then overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs " congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and " commends the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure gain the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide legislators as the June bill did?
The last version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the principal Republican of the committee.
The spokesman for Lugar said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other subject that actually results in a vote of the whole assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded so far in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not because of lack of attempts.
Goodlatte's is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment of the budget balance only in the House, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but give their sponsors - especially novice Republicans who seek to refine their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of this measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can fulfil, while the representative José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York) wants to remove the two-mandate limit for the presidents.
Mr. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democratic by Illinois) proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment prohibiting homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as is an amendment prohibiting the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to permit the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that the members have been proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster rate than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Bounce but not defeated," Giffords talks in his first TV interview since shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him in a constituent act in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat by Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang accompanied by Broadway's melody "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented its difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned by surprise to the House to issue his triumphant vote in the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special "20/20" one-hour program, which was released on the eve of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special programme analyzed the recovery of Giffords since the shooting on 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with a shaved head and a long scar crossing her forehead.
She can only hold one or two fingers up, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, you see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach you how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A tip of the lips.
And then his first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords pronounced another word - "all", a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: She sees the congressman singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who has been on therapy for two hours every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords an article in the newspaper about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspicious gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being detained in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I told him, "'Gabby, you haven't been defeated," Kelly said.
"You've only been beaten.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover, and you're going to come back harder than ever."
Troops make them feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At the time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators, and marine children broke into their positions around him.
The crowd of labels stood up and applauded.
"The men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of spring funds.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then President of the Joint Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
"They showed them like a kind of orphan," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The strikingly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that the military and a U.S. public have taken over often distant, sometimes worshiping.
Enchanted troops with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise has a price, they say the members of the service.
The public acts more and more as if they hurt those uniformed.
"We are not victims at all," said Brig-Gen Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some show their support is to put ourselves in the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to appear disagreeing or disagreeing with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most of the discussions on grief take place in silence and in private among war veterans.
After his two sons returned to fight with the Marine Infantry, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be "an angry and violent veteran below the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him whether he would be able to stand under the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions," Cancian recalled telling himself to his children.
The military unrest arises, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
The achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were completely common in World War II," said retired lieutenant general David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
Army Faces Growing Pressure to End Rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of applicants are being organized for the next.
First soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at the Miramar Air Base in northern San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a 12- can beer package.
He asked if he could join her in his room for a drink.
"It's an alarm signal," says Lyman.
However, Texas native left aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd heard my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, throwing her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of current and former military personnel are eagerly awaiting a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the demand they have brought against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The claim alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Submitted in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the claim initially involved 17 claimants, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their comrades, and that the army failed in investigating, prosecuting, or providing adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going for the army's biggest plan, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure from top to bottom," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?"
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of which could be part of future demands.
Their strategy: Instead of accumulating all the applicants in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defence, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has tabled a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or old soldiers for injuries suffered in the armed forces.
By a judgment of the 1950 Supreme Court called the Doctrine Feres, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by the staff in active service.
"The alleged damage is part of the military service of the claimants," the documents say.
The Department of Defence refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two thirds of them have been killed in combat situations.
It's time for the army to upgrade too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are in progress, in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Legal Services Clinic for Veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a suit against the army that focuses on the diagnoses of " personality disorder" assigned to victims of rape in order to release them from service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a human rights group.
Its group filed a claim in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the manner in which it handles claims of benefits for persons who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine bills have been tabled separately in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, the attacks are markedly below, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which account for approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the processing rates: in 2010, 20 per cent of the reported cases in the army were at trial - half that in the civil justice system.
The applicants in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he said, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different from a multitude of police, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted to a rape kit, and her aggressor's blood - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons declared as personal witnesses on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to work -- I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psych ward, and when I went out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That wasn't his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was exempted from service under less-than-honoured terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his demand colleagues continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, Professor of Law at the George Washington Faculty of Law.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move on."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of Doctrine Ferries.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence as responsibility.
And he adds, "The odds are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the audience isn't on its way, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will queue his other hundreds of applicants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform occurs," he says.
"Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another type that aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from being alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time before his attack against his computer, talking to some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing social media groups.
After the tragedy this summer, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to go on Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't so hard to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report on European digital populism by the UK DEMOS study centre.
Facebook's personal information alloy is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific precision - the way sellers have been using for years.
The Bartlett team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then sent them ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes to violence and optimism about their own future.
Upon arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme right matches in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a totally new way of doing an investigation," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry at immigration.
However, in a sort of twist, "those who combine their activism in line with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."
DEMOS's work is just an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "I like", messages on the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating an increase in research, boosting the number of academic jobs with the name of the site in the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study the people you couldn't get close to with a folder on the street.
"In the past, when you were trying to poll people in the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go through the party, and they would never allow you access," Bartlett says.
"Facebook eliminates all that -- you're going to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study conducted by Dr. Megan Moreno, University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues, found that university students who talked about their drunken exploits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential advisers, could control the site and intervene to help a student who publishes too many state updates with their drunkards.
"You can't handle a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development Center at Seattle's Child Research Institute, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "punching" its own population to obtain data.
The Site Data Team has developed statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - digital freedom defenders long ago who claim that the site should make available to others its large amount of research data).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the sacrifice to be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey that they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining his profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study that carried out with the public Facebook walls of students.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that an investigation topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of the information on a user's profile and the messages on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a pen and pen are still the best research tools no one can use.
"There is no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social still happens offline."
"Fried and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a resistance fighter during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templars of Norway," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court, as it has received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I don't pronounce myself guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, bar access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope of looking at Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked in prison.
They all attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor to the Norwegian NRK station.
"It was uncomfortable, but to me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at journalists and survivors in the eye when he came in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a greater "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not a mentally ill, and said that there is no evidence that he would act with accomplices.
Some may be advised that the attacks on 22 July appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically ease the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," said a relative of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it seemed like it."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview, shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in a recently rediscovered interview to Jobs that has been unscathed as the advance of a series of special projections in the larger markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and workflows of the products.
It was undoubtedly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but it was also a meticulous organizer and a jokki of flow charts - a man who thought many executives suffered "a disease that consists in thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringey was developing the TV series The Triumph of the Nerds on the top of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time it had been scarcely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensely on his new NeXT computer company, waiting for popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of Cringey's interview was used in Nerds, he said that the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs died that a full copy of VHS was discovered in the manager's garage.
This file material, slightly reissued, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute missing interview that arrives at the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where it seems impatient due to Cringley's questions, pushing him to go faster to the subjects or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies do right and wrong, and offers their own vision of the future of computer science.
One thing is to read posthumous reviews of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the eager dreamer on the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not long after she explained everything in detail here, she went and did it.
A quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always asked: "Why do you do things?" and the answers that give you invariably are: "Oh, that's just the way it's done."
Nobody knows why he does what he does, in business, nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs brings to detail its efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Bewildered by the way in which the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made to the eye of good cover, and then adjusted with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs tells the "Blue Box" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack effectively the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been written extensively about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here when describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describe how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were involved around the world a half a dozen times and you screamed through the public phone and returned a minute later to the public phone from the next door," Jobs says with a laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
The two of us, we didn't know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak to the Pope while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two burst into jail just before the Pope himself was awakened to go answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and phone sales with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was hunting spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and formed my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I'd get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for her.
On improvising innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the march.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of base plates, he was asked by a customer if he could assemble the whole team.
Working only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later, while he was in Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they yelled at me that it would take five years to create a mouse that would cost 300 dollars, and I crawled out and left and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for 15 dollars and it was totally reliable.
About big companies losing strength:
Long before he led the renaissance of Apple, Jobs prophesied how many industry leaders would stumble in their vision, and lose control of their market share.
"You say you work on IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopiers and printers, so what?"
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this kind of people who end up leading companies and people in charge of products who are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position is rotten because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over from the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows."
Much is learned about its subtleties.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can't do to make the electrons, the glass makes them, the robots make them, the factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjusting them all at once...
In the end everything is reduced to taste - it goes down to trying to expose yourself to the best that a human team has done, and then try to adapt those things to what you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed of stealing big ideas.
What partly made Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were casually the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with the rivals of the Health Care Act while the court accepts the case
On the day the Supreme Court met in private to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were hosted at a dinner sponsored by the signature of lawyers who will present the case before the High Court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total reform of health care approved by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists throughout the country.
The judges agreed to admit that the demand is being processed and, in fact, a historical claim of 5 and a half hours is expected by March, and the outcome will probably further disturb the 2012 presidential career, which will be at full swing at the time of the court's decision being known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and claim that the law must be discarded will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the government of George W. Bush.
The firm of lawyers of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated for many years to defending conservative legal principles.
Another signature that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the giant pharmacist Pfizer Inc., who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the Health Care Act.
The special guests at dinner?
It is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, they might be said to fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: "A judge may attend events to raise funds from organizations related to the law and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, an honored guest, or be on the agenda of such an event. "
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with enormous financial interest, was enough to alarm ethical activists in the government.
"This striking gap in ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several judges who obey the court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were held in a gala fund-raiser with lawyers who have pending cases before the court."
Its appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the criticisms that they claim to mix the court's activity too easily with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is the magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General of the Obama Administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying that he was too involved in defending the law as for now being impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that he will.
Boeing receives a $18 billion record request
Emirates Airline requests 50 Boeing 777 double corridor aircraft with 20 more option.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner planes to Oman Air, an operation valued at over $1 billion.
Rarely is it news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. planes and the selling price for the 50 planes amounts to a record of 18 billion dollars.
It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine growing in future orders of planes.
In a study published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend his biggest order of history for commercial planes for its value in dollars - 50 Boing 777 double corridor jets.
The successful request came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, announced Boeing at the Dubai Aeronautical Hall 2011.
Then on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had requested six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, to assume fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is over $1 billion.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing," said Morningstar Neal Dihora analyst.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - it is not so harmful, because the country is earning money with the increase in the price of oil.
That is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates' request solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide-wing aircraft market and helps to keep on track its Airbus SAS competitor's attempt to invade his domain with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the air fair took place four months after Airbus said he was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
He retracted the debut to add more impulse after customers required an increase in the payload and range.
Boeing Co's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexico's President's sister, apparently defeated in Michoacán's vote
Luisa María Calderón states that the drug traffickers helped his PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the story for governor.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her candidacy to Governor of Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers helped to tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the career for governor of the Western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa María Calderón in a radio interview one day after the vote on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... took over the polls, set up barricades... and ordered the people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
However, it is the setting up of a return, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have barely outstripped Calderon, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservative National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, currently in charge of governorship, remained in third place, a great defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the capital mayor of the state of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the birthplace of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was murdered a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and many candidates left the local candidates out of fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant the elections of Michoacán appear, a victory will help push the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, for next year."
BASD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to prevent a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of the Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director general of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said that the two largest growth economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in a "impartial" way and said that Asia's financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together in this."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview with the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italian debt costs have been dangerously triggered and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that it could push the world economy into recession and have generated calls for major emerging economies to unite to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering the fall in exports and the exhaustion of foreign capital revenues.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when facing their own and profound economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the billions of people in India, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that will not go well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain the many well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, in jobs of poorly managed enterprises, and loss generators such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens with "important chain effects" across Asia.
The forecast of the Asian Development Bank of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now faced with "down-risks" due to Europe's threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make " contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon's series of warnings about possible defence cuts
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, warmed Congress on Monday, warning that the planned automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a chain financial reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already drawing the $450 billion of reductions over the next decade, but now it fears an additional 600 billion or more reduction in cuts that can be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, who is republished by Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, who is republished by South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "rescue", would result in 23 percent global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
"A cut so large, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects cannot be executed - you can't buy three quarters of a boat or a building - and seriously damage other efforts of modernization," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to withdraw from many of our civil servants in an involuntary manner and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to meet the target."
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage good will."
The cuts over time would reach combat troops, Panetta said.
"While the financing for times of war in the overseas contingency accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the efforts of the war would be negatively affected by the serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"Recruitment of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and the monitoring of the contract supporting the war."
"The payroll staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defence.
"The result of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's largest military power."
"We are firmly opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result that one can live with, and certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the interests of United States national security, and it should not be allowed to happen."
If the letter from Panetta and the recent warnings from the senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or intensify the calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts is to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about the possible cuts, although she came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budget experience in Congress and the White House and knowing she was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to fulfill the mission," Panetta said in his opening words at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers moral decline, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential adversaries."
"In fact, he invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlines new details of how reductions " generate significant operational risks: delays in response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously committed around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter combat aircraft, a new scheduled bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat boat and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping the development and additional F35 tests could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but their supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the latest headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging charges of sexual harassment with several women; each party accuses of lying to the other.
The administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolás Sarkozy was "piled" with an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsing countries.
Congressman for New York and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made the ridicule with his deniers quickly defeated by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of infractions in funding the campaign related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who lives it will ever forget the media circus laid off by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about cheating in school and university exams are very widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given the exam responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deceit do we find?
On any day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for personal as well as professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the past six decades in prestigious universities that carried out deep research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been rebutted.
Liars do look in the eyes.
They don't always stutter, whisper, rub or worry.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, the formation of questions and times.
I spent several years investigating scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help to navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, or negotiation management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to make others feel at ease, handling their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that the extroverts lie more than the introverts, that men say more "self-oriented liars", while women say more "orientated towards others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less frequently to their mates than those who are not married (but the lies they usually say tend to be "normous").
We also know that if you are perceived as an evildoer, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How to know if someone's lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called "creating a baseline."
Helps provide benchmarks to measure changes later.
Observe the position of the subject, laughter and vocal characteristic.
It's better to know if someone usually hits with his foot all the time not to make unfair accusations when he sees his feet beating in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for deceptive, verbal and non-verbal behavioural groups.
Consider these behavioural groups as warning signals, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the top of the body by trying to remember their story, they can point their feet at the door, lean toward an exit, change their position significantly, or exhibit a "post-interview shock" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position once all the difficult questions are over.
Questioners often falsely show that the interview has ended just to look for that post-interview relief.
He also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson stepped into the bottom and used the time last while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her at the national level.
People who cheat can also use a distancing language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... until I understand."
This makes the answer a perception instead of a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the pipeline diverted after the threat of the US delay in its approval
Days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering the unions, as it calmed the environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to redirect it.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned oil pipeline outside the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and is confident that the project will gain approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's manager, Alex Pourbax, says the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This follows the announcement last week by the State Department that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes avoiding the areas of Sandhills of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater, are being studied.
"This is a real way of making progress," said Representative Lee Terry, Republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may separate any decision until 2013, after the next year's elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the State Department, and expressed his full support to them.
The 1,700-kilometre oil pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to refineries in Texas.
To do so, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by the environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But the lawmakers of Nebraska opposed to the plan are overtaking the legislation to force a remoteness of the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's current environmental impact study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department's general inspector has ordered independent proof of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is if the lobby member hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign advisor in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is if a signature that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of allegedly causing a child to throw up in fear
A New York family claims that the diva of the disco music, Patti LaBelle, acted like a madman in the lobby of his Manhattan building, landing his little daughter to the point that she threw up in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's diaphragm frightened Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, so much so that she suffered "changes of personality, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," says her family in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when Tramoist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were getting ready for a family trip.
As Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with his luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came back and said to me, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes, and I went to get her," he said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J out loud...
He had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water out of the bottle on me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," the girl's mother said.
LaBelle shook over the mother -- who was still subject to Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her environment and withdrawn from a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but did not get an answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but family counsel Sam Davis said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money he gets to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct," Davis said.
"This type of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it comes to a kindergarten teacher who takes an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate adversity brake the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, lowered foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in Sinaloa's economic history, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, self-denominated for change, which generated high expectations for progress in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, instead there is a deterioration in the main economic development indicators.
The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions of losses to the agricultural sector, limited the potential of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of the overall economic activity of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost damage, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damage in 582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main sinister crops were vegetables, corn and garb.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of State unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since by January to March 55,053 signalees were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate changed to 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in number of persons dropped to more than 74,000 unemployed signalees, an increase over the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the U.S. Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have taken place since public policy.
"What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation passed at the Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who take dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people leaving the state looking for work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties of entering, and secondly because entering already have many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informalness
The analysis of the labor market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population occupied in the state works without being cited as a worker before any social security institution.
Together with unemployment and informality, another of the state's labour shocks is low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Insurance Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of signal workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
IED Contraction
Together with the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011, the largest decrease in the Foreign Direct Investment of the last 10 years is recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economics of January to June of the State FDI amounted to $630,697, representing a decrease of 87,74 per cent over the $5,143,312 recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17 billion 280 million pesos per year, mainly by enterprises in the tertiary sector.
Debt
In light of the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State applied in July to the state congress for the approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos, same as the investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the local congress was 2 billion pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, we have to align the effort of everyone and above all the good already synchronized march of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López reported that events such as early-year ice cream stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including ice creams, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows for an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we are closing far below the expectations we had," he mentioned.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the National Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he said that it is necessary to put the state in place for productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefine, because it is important to detonate all the potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work to be done
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better governs the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been trying to achieve good results in different areas, there are some progress in economic development, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its conduct of public policy.
"There are elements that allow you to say that the Government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He's sentenced for 8 kgs of marijuana.
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fines for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the drug addict sentenced is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of marijuana possession for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army, on 7 June 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite post 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narconoudist circulated in a pick up truck, white, where he wore a black bag in the vehicle box and in the copilot seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms of marijuana 23 grams.
For these reasons, the insured person was at the disposal of the District Second Judge and the sentenced person continues to be in the Centre for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Should contributions for works
Social works included in programmes such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or seriously delayed due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the work programmes have so far been advanced, they are at risk because of the failure of the Government of the State to comply with its contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 per cent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so that the possible delay in the conclusion of them becomes in force.
"It's almost 12 million that they have to contribute, and even though the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth, when they've had to give us a share since July," he said, "we've started the works and go very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions they had received, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million which did not at that time provide the state administration.
"It has already happened to us in the previous sex year because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued to walk, and this year we had to obtain the resources to cover what the State left behind," he said.
Despite the State authorities ' commitment to comply with the delivery of these resources, he noted that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to expedite efforts to ensure that the percentages corresponding to them were made as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth."
Valid cut "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional disputes brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree advancing the so-called "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, by failing to meet the eight votes needed to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was rejected for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and the decree remains in force.
The draft judgment, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favour of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The full House of Ministers also decided to dismiss the demand put forward by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering the discussion of the project, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the President-in-Office said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the preparation of the public administration.
"I also do not consider that if it were to be done, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector corresponds to the federal executive, who is constitutionally mandated, the rectory of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years, and it translates into better use of the radio spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
To postpone the change, he said, would delay the benefits of digitisation, which involves a decision of public interest, which has not only a technical dimension, "can cover economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "requires the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic rectory of the State, includes a group of powers which the Constitution leads to the power of the State executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital transition, and had done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, which in some way invades the area of competence of Congress, since compliance with the laws issued by the legislature is being provided in the administrative field, he said.
They analyze the possibility of a vote-by-vote count in Michoacán
According to the data released by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, not yet counted the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data released by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 per cent, not yet counted the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), Maria de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just on 9 November, the electoral body adopted a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its State Election Code or its Electoral Justice Act, provided that the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period so that they could enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time limits provided for in the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local Legislative Power and called as "invalid and illegal" the state representative's vote to constitutional reforms, since he has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote", Maria de los Angeles Llanderal explained that through the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the EMI it will be possible to make partial and total accounts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be made on the assumption that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no balloting and calculation in the box record or does not work in the office of the President of the Chamber; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total account of the vote received in all the boxes of the election may be made where there is evidence that the difference between the alleged candidate who won the election concerned and the candidate who obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition that applied for the second of the candidates identified.
The total vote may also be counted if, at the end of the ordinary term, the difference between the alleged winner and the second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is the express request of the political party representative whose candidate remained second, in which case the electoral packages that have been the subject of partial counting will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation there is the choice of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total records.

Some did not believe it because they said that he was even dizzy in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio recalls him as a very good person, "only in Saltillo was the whole family wanted to greet him, as the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Zapopán for his family's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: piloting an aircraft.

Locate three abandoned corpses on the farm of Cadreyta NL
Hours before the finding, the military authority presented to the media eleven persons who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot-killed in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, in an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The finding took place in the mile 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed through the place noticed that in the fifth, whose bar is beige color with coffee, there was the open gate from pair to pair.
Looking inward, about three metres away, they located the bodies of three persons, so they immediately gave notice to the authorities concerned.
One of the individuals wore yellow beach with dark shin underpants, without shoes; next to him was another with white stripes.
A few feet away was another individual's body with red beach and blue cheek pants.
All three of them were down their heads.
According to the data obtained on the site, the three persons would have been killed elsewhere, since no helmets were found on the site.
In the barda de la quinta are seen legends that are directed from one organized crime group to another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same and the gate.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of the economic disaster
The so-called Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of the economic disaster and has put the whole eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will assume office.
Monti said he will present to the president the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The frame is now well outlined," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain the overwhelming confidence in Italy.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the yield of the Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were obliged to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly driven by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are meant to have a good outcome," the press told Angelino Alfano, secretary of the right-hand center party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks came under pressure to warn that a failure in Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations.
He'll end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister will succeed.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of the eurozone.
Monti has said that his government should last until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the generalized predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections are made.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his office, but the big parties insist that it should be formed only by technicians, an indication of their repairs to a process that is bound by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties are making it difficult to include political figures.
The dew of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Ticos
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten outnumber the 50 international games.
On Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 people summoned arrived at the 50 meetings.
A capital contrast to that of Costa Rica, if compared to the 22 convened by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at San José National Stadium.
While world and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly ranches, account for a broad record of class A inter-selection games, Tricolor only owns the defender Michael Umaña as the only one with the 50 international parties.
This figure was reached on the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers playing in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England maintain an intense activity every year in league championships and home Cups, and high-level shocks in European Cups such as Champions League.
The experience with the Spanish Fury is added to the above in complicated eliminations of the Eurocopa and the World Cup.
Ticco footballers, on the contrary, possess a limited international rock in an area, such as Concaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish Selection is of the archer Iker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the registration of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today in front of the Tricolor and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, a Barcelona brain wheel, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenaries of the Iberian team, the quoted Zubizarreta 126 and the Schalke Ariete, Raúl González, 102.
Almost the centenarian figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tic side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the artillery Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five passed the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
More than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't getting close at 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar owns only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson still don't start.
The historic golfer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 dianes, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records as many as nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Fifth included the country on its two-decade tour of history
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday, at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band assures that for them it will also turn the dream of playing in the country into reality.
This was said by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week.
The grouping is located in the South American wing of its two-decade work tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the Angelina band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, is it a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what their fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I've been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to stay a few days there.
So we're thrilled to take our music there.
I ask you this because there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensively the previous days.
What do they tell their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the last 21 years have been happening for the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that it will set us up for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we found out, through people who love surf.
Seeing the tour, they've been delivering huge shows with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never touched there before, then we have no restriction on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this for?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting to us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting to people.
With this tour, they're celebrating 20 years of journey.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think any of us would imagine we'd be in a big rock band and have done it for over 20 years since it seemed like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and we are so excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we love to make music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world to which we always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean to you to be a fundamental part of the grunt's emergence?
It has always been an honor to be part of that band of great bands.
We are very close to the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and it is something unusual.
From time to time, a band in a city emerges, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands leave at the same time in a city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we're lucky to be friends of all of them still and honor us to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It is also very strange for a band like yours to stay together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Camron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
First of all, I think we are all fortunate to be still alive and, secondly, we all care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that allow everyone to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
The relationship of you with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we've grown up, it's been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you're not too busy on tour because it's easy to fall into that game of great crowds and people who love your music.
While you remember that people are there for music, it reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without falling in for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we're still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or I see a picture I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was a surprising human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked most, so we're eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and have to be very entertaining.
Why do Yellow Ledbetter's lyrics always change live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
There are so many of them.
Among the first things that happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam keep the grunt relevant even though it was no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that emerged at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now doing better music than ever before.
At first, his music had a darker content and has now become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs even though they may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched me, I cried when I heard them and they were deeply dark songs.
I think that when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a relative or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, they certainly represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is admitted again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed by the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his head doctor reported.
Fujimori, 72, who carries out a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including cancer in the language for which he has been operated four times and which remains under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told the TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because he is known to be innocent.
It was operated four times from cancer to the tongue, it has a weight loss of 18 kg to which other pathologies have been combined such as severe erosion gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney calculations, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in detention since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the Police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people by an army annihilation squad who operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Musica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official group, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican pair, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the group of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "proper for the exchange of information in all political matters between the two nations," according to the South American presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when French agent Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a declaration that provoked Uruguay's rejection and the call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group composed of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country, since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has been trying to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) "gray list", made up of countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (CTA) which has increased the exchange of goods between both nations.
The bigotudo fontanner passes through the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tireless, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but he has never done so far in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which reaches all over the world this month, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without needing glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press manager in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support", since so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo spokesperson said that despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Alvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to bind the less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to take a "second round" to the levels of play, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This Super Mario incursion in the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a portable console, which was not produced since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo tricks the followers of the saga and repeats the formula for the success of previous deliveries, consisting of that the moustache fountain will have to travel rigged platforms of danger with the aim of releasing Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom swallows the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he was involved in the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy to wash US$70 million.
This concludes the process for Guatemala to respond to the northern country's request that Portillo be tried there.
At the press conference, Colom stated that his decision was due to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court of sentence had already ordered extradition.
He asserted that during his mandate he "did not put his hands" on judicial resolutions and gave all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Morocco will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The fact of Colom involves an executive process after all judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to prosecute the ex-mandate from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once it has resolved its legal status in Guatemala and their human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted by Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid falling into the marginality of untrained children
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support institution Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of the century.
This adds to the 100 long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an event held at the former Fabra i Coats factory where more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of devaluation or in a situation of falling into marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated on a large number of heads of entities and institutions who have been collaborating with the association over the past 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the event the former counselor of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current eco-socialist councillor Richard Gomà.
The present councillor for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director general of La Caixa's social work, Jaume Lanaspa, also came to the large hall of Fabra and Coats.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present one too is, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example of knowing how to fight bad circumstances and giving hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Delocated an okupada farm where macro parties were made
The invaders had taken 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the estate at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the neighbors of the 51st of Balmes Street have come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday's noon voluntarily the building that they were illegally occupying, where they organized macro-fests that were desperate for the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was over, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
"There will be access control from now on," the administrator said.
The okupas, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving all kinds of waste, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the stage of the crowds, which lasted for up to two days and desperate for the tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the disco pointed out that the invaders of the farm made him unfair competition, as they sold the cups to three euros, while at the disco they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment venue had had to respond to neighbors complaints by noise, while, according to the point, the discomforts were not caused by the disco customers, but by the people of the okupada house and, above all, by the participants to the parties that were organized there, who had increased their frequency and intensity in the last few weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The nightclub manager explained that the trouble was so great that he even agreed with the owner of the property and nine months ago that he "forgave" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that during the last few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the PP municipal group at the city hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "the immediate removal of the property to eliminate the problems of coexistence and civicism that produce the neighbours, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one plant of the occupied building, but over the past few months the Okupas had been entering all the plants of the building and on almost all the floors, and that in some even there were thefts.
In this regard, he added, "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be blunt against the incivism that has been generated on the farm."
Also yesterday, the Mossos housed a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police headed up to 35th Street of Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four persons had access to the building.
The four were arrested at the time.
The mountain park?
Architects agree on the occasion of the call beyond disputes about fees
The municipal competition on 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the middle of the 80s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some pasquines for the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of Barcelona metro.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park again stood, in the imaginary of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the north-south axis but above (mountain) -down (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park results in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalis on the role of Yogi bear.
In these were until, in September, the city called a mega-competition composed of 16 contests for so many other access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of the park, no doubt.
Or that or someone's trying to put doors in the field.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both by its purely organizational aspect and by what it implies as a reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost already a recurring subject to be given a hand when two members of this former caste of electors are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact quite rightly gives rise to one of the few coincidences between the opinions of three Barcelona architects, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modéol and Marta Bayona: The contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary" to discuss "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It can start from the base that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title of "Colserola gates" contains a "lexic trap": it is not necessary to think of them "like the access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where action is to be taken".
Modéol, such as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal of "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertain that it is today to project the public space" after the experience experienced in the 80s and that it had in the area of the Forum "his song of the swan".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on which one can build.
"Limitating something is to fix the next step," that is, its overshoot.
"There is a need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can bring about real disasters."
More concerned with the question, Modéol believes that, simplifying, the Vallesana side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", for a purely topographic issue.
Modéol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat that "should not fall into a broken bag", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers to its board to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduit that allows the architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all right," he points out) that they have had to create: "The architects should be just a tool".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest there is a general view of Collserola: "16 cross-border contests have been called in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This causes, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may collide in program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In his opinion, yes, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and will be released
After 72 days of rooting, the legal owner of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that followed him for alleged blackmails
After remaining 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal owner of the Casino Red granted his pardon to the District Second Criminal Court, which follows a blackmail trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, released a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee so that the regional city council would allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
Following the public complaint, the State Attorney's Office opened a criminal proceedings against the Panist Mayor's brother, and on 2 September he was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor's Officer 3 in Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old District of the State Capital.
There he remained for 49 days after being given a second order of conviction after the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had dismissed the offences of organized crime and cohabitation.
On 19 October he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison for allegedly blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos; however, he remained only a few hours in the middle-security prison as there were threats of death against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October he was seized by the secretary of the District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months after the investigation, sufficient evidence was found to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the 1.5 million pesos charge to the representatives of the betting house in exchange for the operation.
This Monday, the legal owner of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, came to the judge José Luis Pecina to apologize for the mayor's brother; so in the coming hours he could recover his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's agent assigned to the judge, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and which of the gambling partners was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the 197/2011 file, the legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and no claim may be filed for the subsequent proceedings; in addition, no compensation or punishment will be required.
Following the hearing of the legal takeover of the betting house, about 15:50 ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be filed.
It shall also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionysio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air crash where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, lost his life, and seven more people
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others, lost their lives indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were the right to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the quotes had contact with trees 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it had the requirements to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that research in the impact area does not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The helicopter's design was for 19 passengers, with adequate requirements to transport the passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary assured that it is a priority with the results before possible; however, research can last several months, even one year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Major State helicopter operated at cruise speed and that this happened in a soft terrain ascending.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the TBS holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual Flight:
In accordance with aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out under the visual flight rules, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM placed appropriate conditions for takeoff, as the aircraft advances towards the boundary area between the DF and the State of Mexico, low-altitude cloud layers were present.
Selected paths:
It is likely that by the conditions of cloud the crew has sought a less elevated area and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last radar aircraft record match, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and side path.
The pattern of scattering of aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the sinister there is still no evidence in the ship's remains of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was allegedly disarticulated along that route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After careful search in a larger area than the agreed site, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, strengthening the presumption that the impact was presented in structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Social Security conducts research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it conducts a research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Obesity of Children and Adolescents' protocol, which will enable them to have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialities Hospital of the National Medical Center 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionologists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) from the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research invites the population to participate whether or not they are eligible, to visit IMSS's participating sports units in the Mexico Valley, where the tests are carried out to minors, every Saturday starting at 8:00.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Quauhtémoc Sports Unit (Posient Mexico State) and that since 8 October, the activity takes place in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (East Mexico State).
Once the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Sports Independence Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day was celebrated on 14 November, the goal was to bring together 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and family history of disease, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that Saturdays are applied to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (Genes are identified that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this investigation is due to the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys noted that in just six years, there was an increase, in the case of children, of 77 per cent in obesity, and of girls of 47 per cent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed', said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country's population differs from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that overall, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and which is stored in fat form.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which allows to detect whether they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-coloured folds (canthosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the probability of metabolic and even prediabetes changes.
The information is handled confidentially, the doctors deliver it in writing to the parents, who are explained to each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle they must make in order to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to high caloric intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid bakes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sent to the floor were taken care of, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand baths each season of rain in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the construction and maintenance of an asphalt floor is the right one, the bags could be reduced in quantity or, even, completely eliminated.
In his conference A technological opinion of the baches, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory in charge develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and therefore the formation of bass.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, high molecular weight ones, called asphaltenes, and other low molecular weights, called maltenes, which together give the floor its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees centigrade has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
The above means that in the streets asphalt resistance is not uniform, but is being modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible flooring, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitute the folder, pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
By transiting the vehicles and generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well on the floor.
If it were modified asphalt, it would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphaltic folder, it abounded, placed a last layer called a bearing folder, which is made of a fine stone material, i.e. a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, you must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the floor that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the bearing folder also requires the appropriate thickness and the material to be taken care of.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the soil is wet, the water is spread inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a rebalancing of all layers of the floor and therefore the formation of baches.
In the process of forming a vessel, he said, the first to wear is the rolling film and only after it affects the asphalt folder, but the damage does not happen instantly, but it is a process that should be addressed to the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of bazaars and, therefore, the thickness of each layer of the floor should always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is fulfilled, in order to avoid the formation of bazaars frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to be done to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow to repair the bags easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna did not reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 of princesses.
Again, the Caucasian Valley is left with the wishes of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to conform to being on the winner's podium, polishing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Fräulein Atlántico was raised with the crown and the sceptre, the department already summed 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one of the legion of Vallecaucan women who have been near the crown but who were proclaimed princesses including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many ask themselves is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Rostro Jolie de Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the jury's decision to appoint her First Princess lies in that she did not agree with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Leamos Literary Street.
To the interrogator, the Caucasian valley replied:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely think that the book that marked me from childhood is "The Beginning," is a fairly profound book.
I currently read "Crimen and Punishment," it is a book of universal literature that we all must read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood."
A response that little liked first for the term "culturalize" and second for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books quoted have marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony he expressed a calm and happy feeling with the result "the universe is wise whatever has to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Beginner" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that Valle has been burned by favourism.
A Bogota journalist insinuated that, as she was the favorite, the ovacionate and the candidate who held all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy, vote of the public for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the zeal of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage".
And that was noted in his first swimsuit presentation on the Hilton beach and his two parades at the coronation evening.
Although it was safe in both, it was noted that it lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic had demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist from the program "How at Home", of the RCN Canal, felt that the fact that Melina was appointed princess "sees that the candidate who wins the most prizes wins during the competition does not remain queen."
In addition, Valle showed himself to the last very dodge with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For one thing, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of their parents.
"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensibility, which before entering the Competition are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of her back defects and fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queens preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, "but her fibrosis problem in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very notorious, lowered points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the error of the Caucasian valley was the surgical interventions that were practiced.
"Surgeries are fine, but Valle wasn't able to do them.
Her body was never her strong and here she was charged."
For this prize, which for the first time delivered the National Competition of Beauty, after the parade in bathing suit came up a cruel Vaticanium that was fulfilled last night, as it was said that this was the container Raymundo gave Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, it is true that Melina has begun a year of reign since today, not as sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international certificates by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass on to history as one of the queens who, despite her rolling passage through Cartagena, was dodged her crown.
So was the work of the chaplain who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A clofoscopyist from Cali passed on to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these staff members is key.
On November 4th, a clofoscopeist from Cali's ITC passed on to history as the man who confirmed the identity of the head of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", through the elbow of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the ITC section, that week was the turn of "availability" to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the judicial investigation area for 21 years.
When he began his career, González worked in the municipalities of the Chocó, where he often had to stay for more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, specialized in hofoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him to wear minimum clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for you.
On Friday night he left for the Caucasus on a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he should identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry Guillermo León Sáenz's decactullary card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the corpse was located, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian lens, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliasar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the chief of the Farcs.
In search of the footprint
For a disciple of the Sijín de Cali the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without any margin of error, which can become key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lophoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals have fake IDs or no papers.
We take the fingerprint and search them in the database.
The investigator told him that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, for in that place the thief had supported his hand to pull out a strong box full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to extract a fingerprint, but in that case we could get the footprint from all hands and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints may also rule out or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
They recently found a dead man with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a mark on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that it was the killer, it does place it in the scene of the crime.
A CTI typologist explained that in the objects "prints are removed with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the ITC expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that touches becomes a mark.
However, if it can be used, if the respective rib is made.
The "indignados" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part complied with the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to enter again, under a court order, at Manhattan Square from which they were left early in the morning and by trying to occupy another Great Manzana park.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allowed the "indignados" to return to camp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to re-camp in the square, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through seats and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "Occupa Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "indignados" to the eviction of his camp, personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "indignant" proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, and property of the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray was unable to confirm the particular figure, while he assured Ephe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders had already moved in support of the members of the movement and had tried to mediate with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private-owned premises - remains closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for this same Tuesday, in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning should be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators who had been displaced up there brought and distributed copies of that court order at this time and even handed them over to the agents who were guarding the square, which led to "some small clashes," said Bray, who reported that some officers had beaten the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities from locating the members of Occupa Wall Street or applying "laws that were published after the occupation began or prohibit demonstrators from returning to the park with shops or other properties they used before."
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out to the press that, because of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to the protesters, to whom he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install themselves with tents and sleeping bags.
The registrar personally defended the eviction carried out in the early morning of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the demonstrators were "violation of the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some business had received threats" and the neighbors feared "because of their quality of life".
"This morning's eviction was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg in the background is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "lacking respect for freedom of expression".
The "Occupa Wall Street" officials also indicated that they plan to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests last, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special TV Christmas
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian leading players, the "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" TV show will appear on December 1st
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescuer in "Baywatch", known as "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian TV Christmas special.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other Canadian leaders, will appear in the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide internet distribution of a pornographic home video in which he appears together with his late husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comic book of Indian origin that recently acted as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special birthday party has Canadian singer Bublé, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "sorra" during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that has taken place in a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that Japan has suffered since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo recorded material losses in $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to pass the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resurgence of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared to the decline of 0.9 per cent in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first downturn after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the true revulsion of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crises to strengthen - or rebuild - the infrastructure, to use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, trips and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refugeal values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the turbulent US forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a lasa in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious reversal for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of the major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, found their weak results between July and September to the yen's quote.
While markets continue their siege to the EU's peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not lower its guard.
"We need to pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday, Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And, indeed, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) specified that most member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates inflation points in the world economy highlighted that the major powers are slowing down.
Since it dropped four tenths to the 100.4 points, opposite the 100.8 of August.
The euro area was even below the average, which is at level 100, by falling eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens once again feeds on doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written compromises
With the peripheral risk premiums fired and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to be entangled in the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his nomination may be short to implement them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit on 26 October," Papadimos said yesterday, opening a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive.
A package with 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras does not cast doubt on his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else."
The conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that it will not give its visa to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still chosen by the impact of the Papandreu referendum order, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the major Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth instalment" of 8 billion, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek wood still has thread for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "preponderant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor in the last two decades in relation to this cooperation instrument, whose "essence" pointed out that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals established by the 2015 horizon, and "very especially in the case of the one whose goal is to halve the volume of people living with incomes less than one dollar a day, with which the "poor threshold" is fixed.
Spain "keep working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and take on this task with "responsibility," said Doña Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originated at the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "guarante the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
They are "many of the achievements achieved" and "many of the challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit presents itself not only as a forum for discussion, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that it is hoped that 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services will end 2015 and that one hundred million of these households will emerge from the poverty line in which they are submerged.
The momentum in the conception of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path begun years ago in a pioneer way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighting Doña Sofia as a "act of justice and due recognition".
And it is that he described the father of this tool as a "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have seen the continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link to this project was worth yesterday the qualification of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "baquero of the poor".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofia concluded her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, he explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic goodwill, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredit represents "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" governments in developed countries must work on solidarity criteria and not let it be a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For its part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to people "excluding those who all close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democrat Union (CDU), on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democrat party.
Initially, Europe's future had not been included on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, in particular to satisfy militants who believe that the government's policy is currently too narrow with the Greeks and could be too strict with the Italians in the future.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted practically unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes were recorded against and ten abstentions.
The standing ovation of several minutes that were won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhil Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summarized in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe involves peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe".
This could be reflected in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to enable the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro area, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give Europe a face".
In any case, that is one of the motions adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank Directive on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
Looking forward to calming the moods within her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But neither has she tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulties willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Recalling that two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The Incidence of Fraud in Disease Reductions
Following the grants, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against disease casualties.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for family allowances and to deliver a speech on the subject, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, in order to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the willingness to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the presidential right-wing campaign, most want to focus on disease casualties.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of shortage on private sector workers before they can take the fall.
In short, unless there is a specific business agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days' wages, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose a day of non-remuneration on staff members in the event of low work (to date, they have no shortage, compared to the three days which apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority again put the issue of fraud on the table, this time focused on the abuse of low-employment.
"There will be a considerable increase in controls and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts," warned Xavier Bertrand speaking at RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement appear disproportionately disproportionate to the reality of low-employment fraud.
In fact, since 2002, there has been constant follow-up to this issue and a number of political offensives have been launched, which have usually resulted.
The French only get sick in the rest of Europe.
Let us look at the national figures carefully first.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), more than €237 million in low-employment benefits were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Economy Research and Documentation, the subsidies for casualties accounted for 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008 and amounted to EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46 per cent corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54 per cent is related to illness casualties, which amounts to €6.2 billion.
Consequently, 2.5 per cent of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that no doubt hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of sickness insurance, indicates that in 2010 37 per cent of the disease casualties were less than 8 days, 22 per cent between 8 and 14 days, 15 per cent between 15 days and one month, 15 per cent between one and three months and 11 per cent were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to catch disease casualties.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (both for health and other reasons) in France ranged from 10 to 11 per cent, compared to 20 per cent and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or 16 per cent to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Fraud in disease casualties is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a rather limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation, since 2002, has led to systematic controls of disease casualties for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term casualties were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties over 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11 per cent of the cases were "adjustably adapted or unjustified; a figure that, starting at a total of 1.2 million, amounted to 132 000.
Thus, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took a sick leave.
Undoubtedly, a small figure compared, for example, to black work.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between 9,000 and 15,000 million euros a year, that is, more than the total cost of low subsidies and, no doubt, considerably more than fraud in this latter area.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten out its economy.
This was stated on Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos before Parliament; he also added that the 100 days that have been granted to his Government of union would not be enough to achieve that goal.
"To make efforts to restore the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public address during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, since "is at stake" the country's stay in the euro area, he added.
As a result, Papadémos has planned that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to about 9 per cent" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed Monday his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but he has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with his party's MPs "New Democracy".
He pointed out that he agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, as well as combating waste, but against any policy that impedes economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the EUR 8 billion loan needed without a written guarantee of all parties' support for the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A committee of experts states that euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized
Canadians live by denying death, as reported by the Royal Society of Canada
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements for that purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included the participation of six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient raises that option and has been judged competent to take the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada occupies the tenth place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death."
With medication or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this sense is recorded by Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not match the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, which have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not resulted in an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or suicide assisted by persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, claimed yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Let us remember that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia, since they believe that it would allow people whose death is near to relieve their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of older or disabled people are less valuable.
As for those who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that a process should not be initiated against them.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of health care for a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
Furthermore, among its recommendations, it suggests that the Criminal Code states that the withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient rejects assistance at the end of his life without fear of responding to a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in the health institutions of Canada, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations regarding the findings of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to the terminally ill.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and over 18 years of age can ask for help in committing suicide," says Deschamps, who consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report appear to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the findings of the report, which she called "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly critical of the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President El Asad to give up power
Damascus denounces a "competence"
Syria is becoming more isolated
The partisans of Bachar El Asad protested yesterday in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on Bachar El Asad's Syria was intensified, which, with Russia's support, resists and denounces that there is a "combat" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened the sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, have expressed their support for the abandonment of power by President Asad.
King Abdalá II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bachar El Asad to "outside power" in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, a neighboring country in Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish diplomacy chief Ahmet Davutoglu has regretted that the mediation efforts he has been making since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them, will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country in which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has concluded that the consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime has been "strengthened".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsh tone of repression in Syria," said Mark Toner, the spokesperson for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces in the Deraa region in southern Syria have already lost their lives, as announced by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (SHR).
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, said the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem believes that the country is "advanced towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, it has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend its functions to Damascus, which in its view constitutes a "hazardous step".
Syria "will not fail," he added, ensuring that "the plot against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civil protection mechanism” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, military media and observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, has also expressed support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which, in his opinion, is confined to the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to develop the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of opposition and the release of the detainees.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Serguei Lavrov, tried yesterday to "correct" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan of the crisis, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time to markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked markets for some time to form their team and launch a programme that will include "sacrifices" to recover the lost credibility during the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and today met with the unions and the employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the Council appointed.
For its part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he hopes that Mario Monti will request a vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti's presentation of a limited list, undoubtedly of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bonds yesterday, asking them for time.
In the "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for forming a Government and preparing its programme, he stressed, adding that he is "sure that the markets will have patience and understand it".
Its designation by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but then there was concern, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister appointed should create a team consisting mainly of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new Government will have to operate until 2013, the date of the next legislation, it considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will obtain the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he is in charge, he will work in the light of the urgency and with the aim that Italy will "regain its protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson for European Commissioner Olli Rehn noted that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not vary."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further rigorous measures.
The Italian "head of the bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see her mate, also insisted on the need to drive the economy, "because a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements".
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to editorialists.
The great incognito will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to put some €200 billion in state obligations before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, said on Monday an American NGO specializing in atomic risk.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
Last week the IAEA expressed its "serious concern" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades since the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk (Ural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, it would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamantes" in Kiev.
His company's economic problems would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Subsequently, it is believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA notes that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as one Member State has informed the Agency, worked for most of his career in such technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50 per cent
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while, during the same period, other types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to those figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. it has increased by 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against the Jews, and a 14 per cent overall increase in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that they have increased this type of crime and crime again," noted the human rights organization Human Rights First, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is especially significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long been pointing out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," added a leader of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. Government can and should strive to put an end to such abuses," he said, "considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. Federal Law was inherited from the time of the civil rights struggle.
That legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging Twitter site modified on Monday the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes their service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another so-called "name" allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Twittos", i.e. those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This lets you know if you follow messages, if you subscribe to new accounts, if you qualify for a favorite message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, according to AFP the spokesperson for Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstintive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, follow-up to recommend follow another user) making the happiness of the initiates, thus opening up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the general public Facebook and Google+ networks.
In the network, users have debated the interest of this innovation with different opinions on tweets.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Activity is going to help me follow some elements of my Twitter stream better," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "golden rule" budget in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Democratic Coalition in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "golden rule" budget to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann himself, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the ceiling of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were to be reduced to a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay €3 billion more in interest every year," said the Democratic Secretary of Foreign Affairs Vice-President Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responded to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries of 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law of equivalent value.
The arrangement adopted by the Austrian Government approaches the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit should decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the structural government deficit of the Federal State should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional States, as well as municipalities, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by around 2020/2021 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong one
The threat posed by a new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the marking of change if the yen continued to increase.
"We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we verify that excessive volatility occurs" in the yen exchange rate, explained Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historic peaks of the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been slowly rebounding since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "refugeal value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar again to be paid on Tuesday to less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the 105 yen symbolic bar, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, as it enhances the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of the revenues obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" following the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the region of Tohoku (norest), pointed out Noda, who fears that the root yen's caressing the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan's "economic bases".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that BoJ had already taken "the right measures", suggesting that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased by five billion yen (EUR 47 billion) its purchases of Letters of the Treasury, bringing to 55 billion yen (519 billion euro) the threshold of funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
euro area:
the types grow, the bags fade
The risk of debt crisis contagion continues to affect European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the types of weaker countries continue to increase.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European stock exchanges sink a little further in the negative area on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., ACC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and London 0.1%.
"In view of the new tensions in relation to the yields of loans from the most affected euro area States, stock markets around the world continue to be part of their recent profits."
"The investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional corridor at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing the concerns of market participants regarding Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed look in Europe and the exchanges will continue to take place on a small margin of variation, so investors will have no proof that the situation has stabilized," considers Mitsushige Akino, Fund Manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The recurrence of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, a fall of 0.4%.
According to the runners, it has lost courage after the match of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion which, in particular, envisages the option for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types outnumber 6%
The credit types of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85 per cent, while the Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the countries of the south, although also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of suffocating with the weight of their debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be his Government's "principal work".
Spain is at the point of view of the markets, while the legislative elections will take place there on Sunday.
The difference in types ("spread") between 10-year obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historic peak.
Waiting for growth figures in the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a figure more favourable than 0.3% expected, driven by domestic consumption.
Insee, however, has revised the second quarter figure downwards, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) rather than stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is really the concern of economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded 0.5 per cent growth over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m. after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is appropriate for an election meeting to be a time for reflection on these issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic developments will double electricity demand by 2050, unless a large part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the increasing shortage of fossil resources must be alleviated in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
That is not the case either of Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or of Switzerland, which aims only to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, for example, continue with their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, returning to the construction of a interrupted power plant following the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such speech.
The election of Berlin will lead to an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noted.
Consideration should be given to the case of Denmark.
Europe's wind champion, with 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the record of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than those of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would result in a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would leave realism to the wonderful declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
It is a price which the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not manifest opposition to that kind of energy by principle, as the surveys show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 executive jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Extensively export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and which can create non-removable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would entail the sacrifice of much of these SMEs and the loss of EUR 6 billion annually in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would charge an EPR designed to operate sixty years, when the collapse of its manufacturer is planned?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, as there is no diabolical source.
The development by Areva of low-carbon and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing plants and the construction of Flamenville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not cause any consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and to unforgivable human failings.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two unprecedented natural disasters, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all the electric actors who want to build a power plant study, the interruption of their construction in Flamenville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized starting from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the statistics policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of the "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped to the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the Libération newspaper of 23 May) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely looked at economically.
The question is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem for a country with about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was Michel Rocard saying that France "cannot take care of all the world's misery" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish fountains.
On both sides, immigrants are regarded as a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande merely includes banality, indicating that the codecrollo will solve the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally profitable, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular the underqualified, by pressuring them to reduce their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are actually rather complementary than substitutes for national workers and are primarily employed in sectors with a lack of employment.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country where there is a lack of anesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes their arrival to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of nationals.
Taking into account the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows represents a rise in real long-term wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants contribute contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of American Nobel prizes naturalized and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization, for example, estimates that an immigrant in Germany who is 30 years of age will make a net contribution (less-expendited income) of EUR 150,000 to average public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term of office, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go look for the points of growth he lacked "with his teeth".
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think about a European democracy.
Democracy is a precious but also fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than 2,000 years ago, throughout the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the crowns in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to definitely triumph over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and as direct as possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little One", that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinodia of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruence.
We must reflect on this ambivalence in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now moved away and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and disorderly.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a halt to the vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take effect, but a common, full, calm and continuous exercise of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that leans on the orders of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from their impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers from humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all of Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for popular sovereignty to regain the momentum of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investment.
The end of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is currently calling for European economic governance.
So be it.
But thinking of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let's make Europeans.
Cards with "without contact" chip are generalized
The world lounge of chip cards starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, SIM cards phones, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations by the Eurosmart office.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for common transport or purchases simply by approaching a card to a reader.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with contactless chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the world’s chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been backward in relation to the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, their beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are being used without contact.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards this year without contact.
In order to make the top march, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have committed themselves to spread systematically in the future, among their customers, bank cards with no contact system," says Gerard Nebouy, director general of Visa Europe France.
Banks Prove Mobile Phone Payment
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for making transactions.
"They're retarding."
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Credit Farm Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and June in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a cover that allows the payment without contact.
The CPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society has also said yesterday that it is preparing for the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which had long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers already "has the certainty".
"The way in which both organizations operate and intelligence service reports demonstrate that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing more details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the gateways.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by persons related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the following day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers particularly captured the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly wait to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys financial and intellectual support outside and that it is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" have become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices and in the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take time to consider the group as a community of illuminators unworthy of interest.
QuickSuccessful
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in hausa, "Western education is a sin") encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the northern Muslim region of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is living a quick success.
It is politicized and demands strict respect for sharia, while its militants engage in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's militants were particularly active and the attacks on the police stations multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as it usually happens, widespread.
The army attacked the city and recorded 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern feudal lands.
Last Christmas, he claims an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another one in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular against the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of these.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations became its first international objective.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, is disturbing to all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was willing to share all the information.
The world according to Republican candidates to the Presidency
In relation to China, Iran and Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A America weakened by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican candidates for presidents, voters might think so.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more stoning statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
The often unfounded slogans spread over China, Iran, helping Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race for the nomination by the "Great Old Party", has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for the manipulation of their currency", a key theme in an America exacerbated by the migration of entire fragments from their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate with a sophisticated view of foreign policy, is nearly drowned by an attitude that "publishes" emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who remains stuck in the depths of the probes, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to interrupt its nuclear programme.
"If I get elected, I'll stop Iran," he bragged.
"If Obama gets reelected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Employer Herman Cain, the second best-classed candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such topics.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that he is willing to deploy the U.S. Army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President say that Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War.
Remember that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of Iraq's "boys" and their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it as weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The population sees Obama's national security balance in a rather positive way, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he was suspicious of military intervention that led to a sinking.
And, arguing that America needs to be reconstructed economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
The North Stream, the new Russian gas entrance door in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea bottom, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a big pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra music and a delicate buffet, at the inauguration of the North Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, have turned together the steering wheel of the valve that controls Russian gas entry into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, each year 27.5 million cubic metres of Russian gas additional to Western Europe will arrive through a first had 1,224 km communicating the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube is expected to be completed at the end of 2012 which will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, that is sufficient to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time of this huge work presents airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had firmly opposed the project.
In fact, the North Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding land passage by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
All of a sudden, these two countries lose some power: for them, it will be harder to influence Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream as a "new German-Soviet covenant", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But price is a weakening of the Europe of energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has known, in just five years, to succeed in its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries, large gas consumers and increasingly limited reserves.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that joins us organically," said François Fillon during the opening of the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the great contracts in the gas sector are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the managers of Gazprom, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it from the anchorages of the ships.
It is supported at the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mines dating from World War II.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, by precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson for North Stream society.
It was also necessary to extremeize the measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted throughout its length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform in the waters of Sweden was planned, but the project leaders gave up on it, seeing that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to establish itself permanently in the sea off their shores.
"In case of damage, we will interrupt the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released to the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that an escape will occur, since they have planned joints that, according to the forecasts, they will have a flight every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is guaranteed by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, which conducts external inspections, as well as by a device circulating inside the pipeline.
With the shape of a pure, it is inserted into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full journey days at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without the need for any kind of repair.
The flow of gas is guaranteed simply by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the stakes.
It was joined by the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and exploiting the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
After that, Gazprom rented the company, for a period of 25 years renewable, all gas transport capacities.
"Gazprom will pay you for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually being transported," Jens Müller says.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been reduced by 30 per cent by the contribution of the shareholders and by 70 per cent by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be EUR 7.400 million for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom assumes the risk of spending alone.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pines.
Some valves, with 4.5 meters high, form the exit door of the gas.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas upon arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand card.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine Papers with the current appearance were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch to the market a book of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant of the company, took care of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the soft skin skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of book was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the present taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who since then became responsible for the brand in Mode Mode Mode.
And he made it.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first few years has been far away, in which only 3,000 Books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and worshiped.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers at its beginning, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city centre, and has been able to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the height of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also launched a notebook with leopard tapas, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer wallpapers... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that causes envy: in autumn 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the SG Capital Europe investment fund, currently Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
About 19 per cent of disabled people are looking for a job.
The XV Week for the Employment of the Disabled starts today.
Despite a determined public policy, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Disheartening?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made for fifteen years is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"But there is still so much to be done."
It should be noted that disabled persons continue to face many obstacles to access to employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 (average 17%).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80 per cent have not finished the Bachelor's degree and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53 per cent for the disabled, compared with 38 per cent of the average.
In other words, there are many issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the main problem," says Christian Grapin, general director of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
Moreover, there are those who are not mentioned; the mentality of people advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur Association for the Cité noted that the directors surveyed have "a level of knowledge on low disabilities", with "excessive representation of persons in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual disabilities".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the objective of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, which date back to 2008, they reach a 2.6% ratio.
"We now reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishment "submitted to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, has decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, has generated great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects true awareness, particularly among large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies with between 20 and 49 workers have disabled employees in their workforce, compared with 82 per cent of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A joy"
About to face the Blues on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly party generates.
We will not dare to say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard really made peace at the auditorium of the Stade de France.
Five months after his forward resentment against Turkey, the Belgian elector has no more than praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for its progress and for it to be Belgian."
"I want to move on," Lille's front guard answers.
As for the contrast between their presentations on their team and in the selection, "it is a set", it has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year round, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to settle down."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "bright".
Don't forget the pleasure.
He has been encouraging the Blues since he was seven years old, as well as during the victory campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been your fan," he says.
This will undoubtedly reinforce especially the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"We have just faced each other recently.
"To play against them is always a joy."
Leekens simply referred to pride.
I'm proud of playing a gala game.
"Proud" also to check, as "neighbourly", that France "returns to being a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a great job," he said with enthusiasm.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share aircraft with the Blues towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up," he said.
"We're building something; players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You can see it in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paul Bento's Portugal faces a great optimism for the party back against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the home party, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
It has no doubt; the Selection, which has been leading since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Euro Cup.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the party of going (0-0), on Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, yes, but was unable to mark the precious goal that had given him peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't made a mark out of the house."
But at home, at the bright Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the party "is very equal", said an optimistic but lucid Benedict.
"We hope the party is very equal, but we are fully convinced that we can take the lead," said the Portuguese coach of 42 years.
"We continue to have a 50% chance to participate in the Eurocopa 2012", however, has relativized Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The tie on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to mark and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, but they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored out of the house," says Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to exercise, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on Bosnians to "leave them no time to think".
A good idea, so long as, this time, it's realistic.
