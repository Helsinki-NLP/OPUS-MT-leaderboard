Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they might give the impression that they are "marione"
Several members of the National Assembly of Wales are dismayed because they have been suggested to change their title, or to be called MWP (members of the Parliament of Wales).
This issue was caused by plans to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene fear that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that he is "sending with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "faecal matter".
A member of the Wales Party of the National Assembly of the Wales Country said that, overall, the group “is not pleased” and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party stated that the group has a "open" attitude to the change of name, but also observed that "MWP" resembles "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales as the letter "u" in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation for the introduction of the name change, said: “The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on even those members.”
The Law of 2017 on the Government of Wales offered the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of these wish to use the ‘Galis Parliament’.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred "members of the Parliament of Wales" or "WMP", but the option "MWP" received the most votes in the public consultation.
It seems that members of the National Assembly of Wales have suggested alternative options, but the attempt to reach a consensus could give the head of Elin Jones, the chairman of the steering committee, who is expected to send the draft law on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include further changes to the way in which the meeting works, including the rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will have the last word on their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote for the referendum on changing the country's name
On this Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their views on changing their country's name in the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organised to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, the neighboring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The government of Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a plebiscite's plebiscite's plebiscite's vehement opponent on the change of name, said he would not take this vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is only a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
The church bells of St. Martin stopped beating as a result of the problems facing the churches in Harlem
"From a historical point of view, the veterans of the place we were talking to told me that before you found a bar and a church at every corner of the street," Adams said.
"Today there are no more bars and churches."
He also said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he said.
"Bars no longer play the part of the day room for the entire neighborhood, where people gather regularly."
And as far as the churches are concerned, it is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than the leaders expect and that, " sooner or later, the outcome will be the same."
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums filled with people who will not support the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
"Most people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "this will therefore accelerate the closure of the churches, as it is unlikely that many people moving into these condominiums will become members of those churches."
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist Congregation, made up of white persons, moved out of that area after 1930.
An African - American congregation, which carried out its religious activities nearby, took over the building.
The St. Martin Church was taken over by an African-American congregation, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a main street for purchases in Harlem, which opposed the engagement or promotion of African-American people.
A fire that took place in 1939 affected the building very much, but Father Johnson's huges made plans to rebuild it and included the carilone in them.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin’s Church, called the charilm of the poor.
The expert who put the carilone into operation in July described it differently: "a cultural treasure" and "a historical instrument of unreplaceable."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also stated that it was the first carilone in the world by an African-American musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a bigger carilone, at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What was heard from St. Martin in recent months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, and others by episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the governing entity of the parish, made up of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to the sacrament, even if it was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the huges complained about the lack of transparency from which the diocese was shown.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old kid who was trying to catch lobsters in California
According to authorities, Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child while swimming, trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m., near the beach Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said for the San Diego KSWB-TV post that he swims for about half an hour, with his friends, on the morning of Saturday, when he heard a little boy shout for help and then moved along with a group that helped him get out of the water.
Hammel also said that he initially thought the boy was pleased to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that he was shouting "I was bitten!
He bit me!"
The whole clavicle was torn apart, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I cried out to all those who were in the water and told them to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack are unknown.
The Salvamar, Captain Larry Giles, told a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a shark species that represents a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the trunk.
Authorities have restricted access from the Ponto beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons .
Giles also mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in that area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury Retailer plans to strengthen its position on the UK beauty products and fashion market
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, making available districts with beauty products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a consolidation of position on the UK beauty products market, worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow, although sales of domestic and fashion products are not to be measured, the larger beauties with beauties will be tested in 11 stores in the country and will be integrated into several shops in the following year, if it proves to be a success.
Investment in the beauty industry comes in the context that supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Representatives of Sainsbury Retalier said that the number of beauty products they offer will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
Also, the supermarket relaunches its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most products are intended for vegan people, an increasingly popular demand among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two stores of the Sainsbury chain, for testing purposes, the first being the open one last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller quantities of food every day from the nearest food store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury Retalier, said that the outlets will increasingly look like universal stores, as supermarket chains are trying to cope with the fight with large discounted stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has included both products from the Argos outlet in hundreds of stores as well as Habitats since it purchased both chains two years ago, which means it has recorded increases in food sales and increased profits.
Previous attempt by the supermarket to refresh its pharmaceutical and beauty compartments failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but the negotiations ended after a divergence on how Boots' revenues were shared in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business, which included 281 stores, to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury Retalier, said: “We have transformed the appearance of our rays with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be at your disposal to give you advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations turn us into an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby retired from a £11 million contract
The TV protagonist "Dragons' Den", Peter Jones, is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby retired from a £11 million contract with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to get involved in their project concerning the Truly brand, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple company was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
Presentation of the 37-year-old "This Morning" show announced on Instagram that it would retire.
Holly Willoughby generated the anger of Peter Jones, the protagonist of the "Dragons‘ Den", withdrawing at the last moment from their business offering lifestyle services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became angry when one of the most coveted television people admitted Tuesday, during a tense meeting at the seat of his Marlow empire of business, Buckinghamshire, that its new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, no longer allow them to dedicate their brand, Truly, which includes accessories and household items.
The company was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby's fortune, with an estimated 11 million pounds.
After Willoughby, 37-year-old, announced on Instagram that he would give up the Truly contract, Jones left Britain to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
Says one source: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It would be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to retire shocked everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was a little bit before the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the presenter of the "This Morning" issue, which is one of the best-selling stars in Britain, could cause the company millions of losses, as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as possible further delay in the launch.
It can also be the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are ten-year-old friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby put the Truly brand base together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, aged 52, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's production company's shares.
Willoughby will become the M&S Trademark Ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host to the I'm A Celebrity TV show.
A nearby source of Jones said last night, “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
I was very hard, and then “we fell in love ”
He joked about the critics he would get from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider “no to a president” and that he had such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make such a big step back?
Trump said imitating a voice from the news representative .
"I didn't take a step back."
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as an enormous step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization are over.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders around the world on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not observe a “adequate response” from the United States on the previous disarmament steps of North Korea.
On the other hand, it noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on this.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
"Everything goes well with North Korea," he said.
“We were about to go to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He also said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: cessation of missile tests, support for the release of the hostages and return of the American military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act like a president, but if I would behave like that, instead of the 10,000 people outside, who are trying to enter this incapacitating arena, it would be about 200 people," Trump said, showing to the crowd who are in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing the death of hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their aid was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok Island population has been displaced, there has been no national disaster, a necessary condition for the launching of international aid actions.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it has been very clear that I am not asking for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation," Sounko said.
Although the “Save Children” Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign staff are allowed to access the site.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesia authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to aid efforts.
Given the earthquakes sustained by Indonesia constantly, it is unlikely that the country will continue to be inadequately prepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh , they are not very often met on other coasts .
It seems that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued in this regard, could have contributed to the loss of lives.
Even in the best of circumstances, travel between islands in Indonesia is proving to be a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this even more.
A hospital ship that has been stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new calamity has occurred.
President Joko Widodo has proposed that the improvement of Indonesia's precarious infrastructure be the central point of his electoral campaign and has passionately allocated money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will participate next year in a new electoral campaign.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from the sectarians of Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes, as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using maces, arches and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the salvador goal and equals the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League in front of Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute, Saturday, at the Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.
Sturridge got a step from Xherdan Shaqiri, while it was about 30 meters from the opponent's gate, and his team was headed by Chelsea with 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a kick in the direction of the gate.
The ball reached over the nail, heading towards the corner of the right above the gate.
Finally, the ball passed by Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped to it and fell into the gate.
"I just had to try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to advance as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think much about it, I just took over the ball further."
Chelsea drove 1-0 to the break after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the blue team sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, then returned in the middle of the field and ran to the half-field of the Liverpool team.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the field.
Then he sent Hazard's ball, which came in.
Hazard went over the defense and sent the ball to the net, able to hit it with his left leg and get past the player Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against the Napoli team in the leagues of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00, on Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against the Videoton team in UEFA Europe League Thursday, at 15:00, in London.
Number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the national disaster agency in the morning of Sunday.
Several people were caught under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the magnituded 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and triggered waves of up to 6 meters, said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, at a press conference.
Palu City, which has a population of over 380,000, was covered by the remains caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected of killing a woman with a knife.
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in the morning, with stab wounds, at Grayson Mews on John Street, and was arrested a man suspected of murder.
The police have asked the people in the area who have heard or seen anything about this subject to come to the reporting station.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in the early stages, but I appeal to all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead who heard or saw something suspicious contact us.
I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful material using the camera on board to contact us if they have information essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belongs to a woman in Birkenhead and was found on a property.
This afternoon, some people came to the crime scene who think they knew the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are in progress, and the police said they were trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but he was told by the police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what happened.
People living in the building were told it would take a few hours until they were allowed in.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
On the spot, there was a woman in tears.
Repeatedly "it's so terrible!".
At 14:00, two police vans were in the perimeter and one more was outside.
A few police officers were sitting in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Any person with information is asked to send a direct message to the @MerPolCC police, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at telephone number 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell from Parliament becomes the most recent memorial monument affected by the altercations on "rewriting history"
The removal of it would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, carried out by its fanatical puritans.
But Cromwell society described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues as a figure of Oliver Cromwell from outside Westminster Palace to become a target.
The iconoclastism of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would sacrifice a wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas from the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said for The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether it is an exact representation, this is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But surely the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure, which is part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated."
A pig caused the death of a farmer from China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media agencies.
The man, identified only after the name "Yuan", was found dead after a bloodthirsty artery was seceded and covered, near a pig farm in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to the Sunday publishing house of Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject swine vaccines to a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that he had come with his cousin from nearby Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of an adjacent hut was open.
He said there was a large-scale male pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic doctors confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin's hairs were full of blood and sprawl," said the cousin, whose last name is "Wu", for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the death of the man did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent him from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and authorities negotiate compensation for its death.
Although rare, cases of pigs that attacked people have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injury to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a pig of 300 kg, a man from Wales was blocked in his tractor until his wife came to scare and drive the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions."
"It's just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them proper respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa, who has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rain in the southwestern United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa loses its intensity as it moves to cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause floods in northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa records wind conditions with a speed of 85 km/h, being a hurricane of category 1, Sunday, from 5 a.m. in the morning and was located approximately 600 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive on Sunday in the north.
Meanwhile, a depressive area began forming over the Pacific Ocean and moved eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approached the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push intense tropical humidity from the north to the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring precipitation up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity that will interact with the depressive zone will generate abundant rain in the south-west in the following days.
Local, precipitation between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
Intensive tropical humidity will cause precipitation quotas up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in some parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation between 5 and 10 cm is expected in the south-west, especially in most of Arizona.
Rapid flooding may occur due to rapidly deteriorating conditions as a result of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture in the desert on foot in view of the threat posed by tropical rain.
The heavy rain could cause the caniones to be turned into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds into gusts and dust.
The area of depression approaching will bring torrential rain to areas on the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of nearly 2 cm is possible, which could lead to minor flows of residues and slippery roads.
These will be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
The scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on the second part of Sunday and on the first part of the month, before the rains spread more than Monday and Tuesday.
Intense rainfall will spread in so-called "four corners" Tuesday and will persist until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense changes in temperature in the United States, as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences were encountered in the central area of the US.
There is a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of summer will try to form and expand again.
It is expected that a large part of the central and eastern part of the United States will face a warm beginning of October, with temperatures up to 27 degrees in extended areas, from the southern plains to certain portions of the northeast.
Tuesday, the city of New York City could reach 27 degrees, with about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high temperatures above average for the east of the United States until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people followed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people followed the press statement supported by the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, TV stations interrupting the normal Friday program for a last-minute news: an agreement concluded between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford told the judge committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had harassed her while she was drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said it's 100% certain that this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have followed the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other transmission networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching from his office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a football game in play-off or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose guest opinion strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the daily hearing.
ABC was in second place with a number of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was monitored by 3.1 million people, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained at a high level after hearing.
Flake was at the center of the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while protestors shouted at it and he was trying to get up in an elevator at a meeting of the Judicial Committee.
He was looking down for a few minutes while people were arguing, and everything was live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling us the truth?
He was told, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Televisions later broadcast the vote on the Judicial Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate's vote.
But Flake said he'd do this only if the FBI agreed to analyze the charges against the nominee next week, which the minority democrats asked for.
Flake was largely convinced of conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators after that.
Flake's choice was an important one, obviously the Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "political games" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with the future of Great Britain and undermine national interests in an interview for the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of Great Britain, attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to his photograph on the front page of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on his plan for Brexit, the so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the European Union collect their mutual tariffs was "completely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims' Shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of killing LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the case of death shot by Wayde Sims, the basketball player at LSU, 20 years old.
Dyteon Simpson, 20-year-old, was arrested and imprisoned, being charged with murder by grade 2, according to Baton Rouge police department.
The authorities published the video of the Sims-Simpson confrontation, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, affiliated CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say he recognized that he shot Wayde dead.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
Baton Rouge Legal Medicine Bureau published a preliminary report Friday, saying that death was caused by a head shot through the neck.
The department deserves the Louisiana police force, the state police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and citizens in that area for the aid offered in the investigation, which led to the arrest in question.
The athletic director LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for "diligence and the search for justice".
Sims was 20.
The 1.98m-high attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for LSU.
Last season, it averaged 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoveries.
Friday morning, coach of the basketball team LSU, Will Wade, said the team is “devasted” and “stricken” by Wayde’s death.
"This worries me all the time," Wade said.
A volcano threw a column of ash over Mexico City
The ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano arrived in the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Disasters warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to keep their distance from the volcano after the crater activity began and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors more horribly and vibrations.
The images on the social networks presented thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians observed an increase in the activity of the volcano that is 72 km southeast of the capital, after an earthquake of magnitude 7,1 shook the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Fighting between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters fought with the gendarmes on the first anniversary of the Catalan secession vote, gathering thousands of demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separates kept away from the gendarmes bombed them with eggs and powdery paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The fighting intensified later, the police using their walking sticks to control the situation.
For a few hours, the pro-independence groups have been chanting "We don't forget, we don't forgive" while the unionist protestors called "Long live Spain!".
14 people received medical care for minor injuries during protests, according to local press.
Tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent a year after the referendum of 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters have chosen, in a overwhelming majority, to become independent, although participation in the vote has been low, and those against the secession have mostly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, with violent clashes taking place.
Pro-independence groups campaigned over the night Friday evening to prevent a demonstration in support of national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer has hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year I lived some of the most beautiful moments of my life.
I watched my parents crying for joy that I can vote, but now we have nothing to do," he said.
Despite gaining a vital victory, but close, in the regional elections of December last year, the Catalan pro-independent parties tried to maintain the momentum this year, many of the most well-known leaders are either in exile or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and declaring subsequent independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone the protest in support of the police, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he will be running for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best way to denounce the regression in the democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Several men were arrested after entering a house with their car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39 years, were arrested after a car entered a Londonderry house several times.
The incident took place on Thursday, about 19:30, in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said they were caused damage to the gates and even the building.
It seems that at some point a gun was used against the car.
Menga's kick helped the Livingston team win with 1-0 in front of the Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston assured victory
Livingston left the Rangers team unrepeated, Steven Gerrard reaching the second defeat in 18 matches, as manager of the Iberian club.
Dolly Menga's kick turned out to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played the same level as Hibernian in the second season.
Gerrard's team remains without a victory in the Premier League this season and faces the Hearts leaders, behind them with eight points next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in division up to six matches, Holt's main coach still feeling the taste of defeat because he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses his chance against cruel visitors
Holt's team was supposed to advance long before they signed up, and their orientation caused all sorts of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break in and tried to hit the gate space, then Alan Lithgow succeeded in kicking wide after he slipped in to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make visitors trouble at the free kicks.
And that was the way the crucial goal came.
Rangers accepted a free shot, and Livingston managed an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to care for Menga, who jumped and scored from the center of that.
At that stage, Rangers had mastered possession, but he faced the impenetrable defense of the host, and porter Liam Kelly was no longer at all disturbed in the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second round, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman didn't succeed against Allan McGregor from Rangers, and Lithgow hit a big shot from another Livingston team player.
The diagonal steps continued to come in which the Livingston team, but unsuccessful, and the two requests for penalties - after Halkett brusked Glenn Middleton and after a belt - were not accepted.
"Game Phenomenal" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an ascending path.
Their style of play and team have not changed at all since the top return, but the merits must be given to Holt for the way he has trained his team since he took it.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the entire party.
But the Rangers weren't very inspired.
Although they have had good performance since they were driven by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The empty steps were unsuccessful, they managed once to catch the door of the free opponents, and this should be an alarm signal for Rangers, which is in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Köln
It was all pink on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin to have breakfast.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany to remedy relations between NATO allies.
They are unhappy about such issues as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
In this context, Erdogan went to Köln to open a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world outside Turkey.
The police have called for security reasons to prevent the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but they have gathered enough supporters nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, most Kurds, made their voice heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him with open arms in the country.
Contradictory protests reflect the division of a visitor considered a hero of some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat of others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies after a collision with a car
A biker died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of town around 10:15.
The car driver stopped, and the paramedics showed up at the accident site, but the man died at the scene.
The accident takes place only a few months after another biker died following an accident that took place on Childers Street, where the driver ran away from the scene, which is about a mile from the place where the Saturday accident occurred.
Metropolitan police said officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in that area, the route of the buses is diverted and motorcyclists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured following a fight
Six prison officers were injured following a fight at a high-security prison for men, said a prison representative.
On Sunday, there was a fight at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at about 9:30, which is under way.
Specialized officers were brought in to deal with the fighting, involving eight detainees, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “The specialized prison staff has been requested to deal with an incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have very clear rules on those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period of time after bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 detainees, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last year, in October, the officers dealing with the disturbances were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, the staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded because of Hurricane Rosa (dry areas can enjoy benefits as a result of this)
A tropical depression rarely occurs in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the south-west desert, with a rapid flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Mondays and Tuesdays in the western part of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and the second day of the month will cause precipitation.
The Phoenix National Weather Service announced in a Twitter message that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of storm or tropical depression over a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an action hurricane about 60 km away from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Center for Uragane predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including in the centre of the Rock and the Great Basin, quantities between 3 and 5 cm will be recorded, with total possible quantities up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in certain areas, torrential rain will be beneficial as the southwest faces drought problems.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona faces at least one severe drought, the second largest category of drought," information found on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides in the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who still had hurricane power in the morning of Sunday, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north, 19 km per hour.
Storm will meet cooler waters in the Pacific and, therefore, it will decrease.
Thus, it is expected to produce landslides in Mexico, with tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening of the month.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, with a high flood risk.
"Torential rains are expected between 8 and 10 cm" from Baja California to north-west Sonora, and can also reach 25 cm", says weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north to Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the morning of Tuesday, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and arriving in southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger posed by Rosa or her remains is extreme torrential rain from Baja California, north-west Sonora and the desert from the south-west of the United States," said a representative of the National Center for Uragane.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden floods, which will endanger people's lives, and will bring waste streams into deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested following a suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old person was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, Saturday, at about 4:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he's in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
Officers asked for the help of citizens who could have material on their mobile phone, respectively, to report to the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced the Democratic Party's "favor and anger"
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also stated that Kavanaugh faced the Democratic Party's "favor and anger" during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress, denying vehemently Christine Blasey Ford's claims related to sexual harassment ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting on her claim.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw Kavanaugh’s genius, quality and courage on that day.
"A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best minds in this generation's legal field," he told the many supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of republican presence in intermediate elections.
“ We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but, somehow, running," he said.
"For this reason, I express everywhere my positive views on the candidates I consider outstanding."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination will take place no later than Friday, said a GOP assistant for CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, growing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken by the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves with a height of six meters hit the beach at dusk, people being taken by the water and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees magnitude.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, thus becoming victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the BNPB disaster relief agency, at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Tsunami brought cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on the land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled at a wide speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He added that some people were forced to climb trees to escape the tsunami and survive.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photographs published by the disaster agency have several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges overturned and collapsed, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
Saturday, the lines continued to shake the city on the coast.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said that the energy emitted by the strong earthquake on Friday was approximately 200 times greater than the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geographical structure of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow Gulf, has probably intensified the scale of the tsunami, added this representative.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of the collapsed buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing people.
Nugroho said that victims and damages could be greater along the coast of 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were “completely disturbed, without any information” in Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
He added: “This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized for not informing that a tsunami would hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In the social media posts, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching people on the adjacent street.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the truth of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major disruption of electricity, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but people evacuated still need food and other basics.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia is 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
As Word Vision staff from Donggala reached safety in the city of Palu, where employees are housed in improvised shelters in the office yard, they passed by devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added, "They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses."
The situation is very serious.
Even if aid groups began to launch disaster relief actions, some people complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesia's regulations, financial resources, material delivery and personnel may only reach the place of production of a disaster if it is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster," we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has been announced yet."
After the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Friday, friends and families of the missing hoped that loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, the rescue staff released a woman who had been in ruins for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Other people in Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"In view of the experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after the news about the collapse of Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding sports community, he sent desperate messages to WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in the right of his messages there was only one gray tick, and not two blue steaks.
"I think that means that the messages have not been transmitted," he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 during the power of an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who feeds an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the car emptied an ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to transport more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man “went off behind employee Brink” and stole a bag of money to carry.
According to the communiqué, witnesses observed several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not mention the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is asked to contact the Newport police at phone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his stage name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changes his stage name to "Ye".
He made Saturday ad on Twitter: "the person officially known as Kanye West".
West, aged 41, is called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of the eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he expects to launch his new album, Yandhi.
It comes on the show in place of the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled "for reasons of an emotional nature", mentioned the producer of the show.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation for the current name of the scene, West stated earlier that this word also has religious significance for him.
"I think "ye" is the most frequently found word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier this year, in the discussion of the title of the Big Boy radio host album.
"So it's you, I'm us, it's about us.
It all started from "Kanye", which means unique, and it came to "Ye", which is a reflection on our good, bad, unclear things and the whole.
The album is more a reflection on what we as people are."
He is one of several rappers who chose to change his stage name.
Sean Combs had numerous stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
And a former West collaborator, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with crumbling, sometimes without, as well as with big letters.
Mexican President Promises Not to Use Military Forces Against Civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military forces against civilians, along with the proximity of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that "he would never use the army to punish the Mexican people."
The troops fired a peaceful demonstration on the market on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left-hand movements of students were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double the financing for AI
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after several U.S. government members made announcements about AI, even though in the US there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it proposes to be in first place with regard to AI innovation by 2030.
"The double budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US and that we are looking for the next AI discovery," Lee said.
Doubling funds could double the chances of the next major AI achievement being done in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "IA Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent companies, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the American player Othello, being the best in the field at the time, and later he was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch of China.
Lee appreciated the previous competitions of the American governments in the field of technology, such as Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects, and asked when it would be next to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funds, said Lee.
"Not China puts beaks in the wheels of academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US to step up its AI efforts.
"I think we should automatically give ourselves to doctors in AI," he said.
The State Council of China issued a New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations provide money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defence of the United States established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence for the involvement of partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Committee in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called "AI Next".
Also at this time, NSF invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, there have been no changes in the legislation of the United States aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote for the referendum if they want to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they wanted the country's name to be changed into the "North Macedonian Republic", a change that would resolve an old dispute with Greece, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which comprises a province called Macedonia, contends that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but the opposing nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign was questionable about the presence of the vote, and that the minimum limit of 50% could not be reached, necessary for the validation of the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot will be: “Do you agree with EU and NATO membership, accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the descent of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, told Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote in order to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum is required in parliament.
The Electoral Commission of the State stated that there were no irregular reports until 13:00.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of voting persons were put to the vote.
"I have come to the vote for my children and our place in Europe," said a 62-year-old voter from Skopje, the capital of the country, Gjose Tanevski.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum on the change of the name of Macedonia, which will allow them to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the parliament of Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavvartarkov prepared a small stage and pulled chairs in front of the tents raised by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with their forehead up, not on the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said that accession to NATO will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that the majority will be in favour of a change of name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of accession to NATO and the EU," Zaev said after she voted.
He said that a result in favour of a change of name would be "confirming our future".
According to a poll published last month by the Policy Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of voting citizens will participate in the referendum, under the number of participants required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour of change.
For the referendum to be valid, the vote shall be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-vest government policy since taking over the government in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to cross the entire Brighton team defense and mark a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to cross the Brighton team's defensive and obtain the Manchester City team's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that Aguero was incredibly easy to mark in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker got a step in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among the three defensive players from Brighton before reaching the free side of the field.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four opposing team players.
He managed to get past one defender, and then he overcame several Adverse Players on the edge of the Brighton team.
After that, he stepped left, the balloon reaching Sterling.
The English attacker sent the balloon back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right leg, succeeding in avoiding the goalkeeper at Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a kick to the right side of the gate.
"Aguero faces a few leg problems," Pep Guardiola reporters, the Manchester City team manager told them.
"I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he wrote a blank at that time."
But Sterling is the one who got their initial advantage for the Azurians in the Premier League game.
The goul came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took a deep step on the Brighton team's territory at that stage.
Then he gave a shit about Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane dribbled the balloon a few times until he sent Sterling a pass, which sent her in the direction of the gate.
The Azuri attacker hit the balloon to the net right before heading out of the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group phase on Tuesday at 12:55 a.m. on Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the game against Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the play-off competition, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday in the match against Colorado Rockies team, but only if there are still play-off implications for Rockies, which hold an advantage with a game facing Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies got at least one unpredictable place, with a 5-2 victory against the national team on Friday night, but still trying to keep their first title of division.
"Even if we don't play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver, next to the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the game on Sunday, but, according to sources, is inclined to let Scherzer take the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening blow of the match with number 34, had a heating session Thursday and will throw in normal condition this Sunday.
The Washington midloop has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2,53 and 300 beats in 220 and 2/3 matches this season.
Trump expresses his support in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation regarding the Supreme Court’s decision on Brett Kavanaugh while he was discussing the importance of republican presence in intermediate elections.
"All our efforts are at stake in November.
It's five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, not candidiz, but actually candidiz, that's why I try hard to support good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, radical group of Democrats, you see what happens right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any means necessary, you can see their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, that's what they want, to have power and control, and we won't give it to them."
He also said that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistence and obstruction".
"And you can see that in the last four days," he also said, describing the Democrats as "wrong and bad, naughty and lying."
He referred to the senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and who is part of the Senate Judicial Committee, who was strongly fled by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you divulge the document?
What?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people from a different point of view.
People who express their views are no longer tolerated
I was not surprised at the fact that the Momentum activists from my local party supported the motion of censure as far as I'm concerned.
After all, I am only one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who was told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received similar treatment because she was vehement in anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the motion of censure was a critic at my address for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar problems, ironically, concerning which neither Jeremy had common views with previous leaders.
The Communication for the Friday meeting in Nottingham East of the Labour Party noted that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, GC meetings on Friday evening were so.
Unfortunately, many meetings today are not being held in this way, and the promise of a “better, softer” political environment has long been forgotten, if ever respected.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the leadership of the party.
Things started to be like this when Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some of my colleagues with whom I had a common vision of politics began to expect me to change my thinking and agree with some things I had previously disagreed with, including national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, it follows a wave of abuses on the dissocialization networks that demand my elimination from the party, denouncing center politics, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than my colleagues, because comments about my person tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with each motion of censure or change of the selection rules, the party becomes less and less flexible on this issue.
Many people have advised me in the last two years to put my head down, not to be so vocal, and everything will be "well done."
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the negligence shown by Thatcher government led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who most needed them, as a local adviser or minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including in the last elections.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and issues that I disagree with with with the current leadership are unclear.
People who supported Friday's motion, I can only tell them that, in the context of the country's heading towards Brexit, which will affect our households, our businesses and our local services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of elimination from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions I consider in your superior interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team reaches top rankings
Despite the fact that two late trials had somehow influenced the final outcome, there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win the extremely interactive game today in Tennant's Premiership.
It's now in the top of the ranking, being the only team with no defeat of the ten.
Finally, it all came to terms with their best defense, as well as with the fact that they took advantage of the opportunities, which helped the host team and thanked Coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been subjected to several tests during our matches so far and we continue to be invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “The merit is given to the Ayr team, they took advantage of opportunities more than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, transformed by Frazier Climo, granted an advantage to the Ayr team, but a yellow cardman received by Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, playing Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to change their score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an unprocessed attempt.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, at the middle of the game, managed to sign up, and then managed to transform an individual trial, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at break.
But Melrose started the second very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The match was suspended for a few minutes because of the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was taken out of the field with the targa, and since the re-starting of the game, Ayr disengaged through the attempt of the player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Captain of the team Ayr, Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the backup player pay with an unprocessed attempt of Bruce Colvine at the end of a severe pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he plated Climo without a ball, MacPherson managed to mark, giving him the advantage of the Ayr team.
Climo transformed the trial, as he did again close to the match's relaunching, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" move and sent the Gregor Henry's extreme deep for the fifth attempt of the host team.
"Still Game" sitcom's view seems to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, star of the "Still Game" sitcom, seems ready to move to the hospitality industry after he found out he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the beloved BBC show, writing his script and playing alongside his long-time partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, the number nine, would be the last, and it looks like Kieman plans his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, this is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this news, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to become involved in the "restaurant developing industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol a naval headquarters full of cranes in La Paz.
Public buildings are flying blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is our law.
We have to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, the memory of a coast lost in Chile's face in a bloody conflict of resources from the 19th century is still alive – as is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at the highest level in recent decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many patients will follow the ICJ decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will give a ruling in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of firm discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who faces a controversial struggle for next year’s re-election – also has much to gain from the month’s decision .
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think it's unlikely that the court would decide in favour of Bolivia, and that there would be too little change if it happened.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant Chile's territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes only six months after the final pleas have been heard indicates that this case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only that Bolivia did not succeed in the cause, but it is possible that the last four years might have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric weakened any Chilean residual goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk afterwards.
The two countries have never exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually rapid.
On Monday it will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end the 139-year disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most beloved presidents of Latin America – used the maritime problem as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Foreign Minister of North Korea, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to keep its promises made during a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
Its comments come in the context that the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, appears to be about to resume diplomatic action on nuclear threat more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said that it is an “unreal vision” as the sanctions continue and the objection of the United States to the declaration on the end of the Korean war ever cause the territory in the north to give way.
Washington is reluctant to agree with the statement without the Phenian first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not believe that Phenian has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompei intends to visit Phenian next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion presentation from Paris presents the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you're looking for hats to expand your collection or completely protect you from the sun, you don't have to look for it anymore.
Fashion creators Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants in Paris's Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
The practical hats conquered the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion creators sent creations that steal their eyes on the podium.
The piece of resistance of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant beige hat, with a wide bour, like a pen, in which the heads of the models sank.
Other super-sized accessories included peppers adorned with beads, a witch's hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and did not fashion haute couture.
One of the creations seemed to be a dive equipment, having a tube of oxygen and glasses, while another seemed to be a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a dress style, with oversized clothing items, you're lucky.
Stylists are predicting a return of huge bonnets in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hats come back after the "La Bomba" hat, the straw hat with a wide bour, seen all over the world, from Rihanna and to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the hat is not practical that has appeared on all social networks has caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, or beach straw people, with a size as large as the model in the swimwear that wears it.
The orange bag of the raffia, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the resistance piece of the spring-summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" of Jacquemus at the Fashion Week in Paris
The star-stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see the oversized hats and beach gangs in the luxury stores next summer, because the fashion creator has had such an impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills, essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional test results, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other Community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students from Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (CIS), strive to provide services at the highest level of their students and parents.
Independent schools propose to prepare their students for high and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, words reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest rates of promotion in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign languages obtained a Higher grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as subjects, are held like STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent curricula and in other fields.
A survey carried out by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for the reasons employers gave for the struggle to fill vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
More and more, therefore, language skills are becoming imperative in preparing young people for their future career.
With more job opportunities requiring foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such ability throughout life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and the French language was the only language spoken by a two-digit, 15%.
This is why investment in foreign language learning is important for children today.
With more languages, especially in developing economies, children will be able to find significant jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be more languages of choice in independent schools, with educational frameworks that are specialized in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills necessary to succeed, however the future would be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so that it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
We have to do it (We have to do it).

LeBron will debut at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is near the end for fans who want to see him LeBron James as he starts for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play in opening the Sunday preselection against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But how many minutes will he play remains to settle.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James will probably play limited minutes.
Following the training from the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game Lakers program in the presison.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need games in the presemblage to prepare," he said.
Time of Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening a series of campaign meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump meetings scheduled in the following week, which include stops in places where the electorate is in favour, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for the candidate chosen by him for the free seat of the Supreme Court is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to strengthen support for the upcoming elections from the middle of the term, as Republicans risk losing control over Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's election meeting in West Virginia take place tonight and where can I follow him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00, Eastern Coast time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can track Trump's West Virginia election online via the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss this week's hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, a hearing that has become tense due to inappropriate sexual behaviour accusations, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week, for the FBI to investigate the charges.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans, who face tough elections in November, to win a bit of land.
Thus, those in President Trump's campaign said that the role of these five meetings next week is "energizing volunteers and supporters, while republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the very crowded campaign season," said Reuters, a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not want to be named.
Programmed to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's rally could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented in the media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won the election at a difference of over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump's trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who's being run in the polls.
"The fact that the president came to try to propel him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a polytologist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team gives proof of determination and continues to fight to maintain the chance for simple samples starting on Sunday
After three clearly-dominated sessions, it is possible that the foursome test Saturday afternoon was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The always oscillating chain of motivation is a concept invented for the world of sports, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
So where is their motivation now?
“They were driving us with six points, now the difference is only four points, so we base ourselves on this fall for a bit of motivation,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point advance, when there are still twelve points at stake.
The Americans, says Spieth, feel that the game starts to change in their favor and that there are enough reasons for encouragement, of which the most important is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and won each three out of four points.
Spieth sent balls to the green area with lethal precision, setting an example for his colleagues.
Those guttural holiday screams became more and more loud as the advance round, especially when it entered a crucial point by which it brought the score back to equality in the fourth match, after he and Thomas had been led by two points after the first two holes.
The kick he won at 15 was celebrated with a similar scream, a scream that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to focus and worry about your own game," Spieth says.
So much left to these players.
18 holes to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe won four out of four games and it seems they can't fail.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who did not need any additional hits on Saturday afternoon, but this statement is valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, even for the nine points on Friday morning.
This performance and how their energy seems to flow towards and from the enthusiastic audience reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would ultimately lead to a potential victory of the Europeans when the sun will hit Le Golf National.
Preferably, both simultaneously, to different holes.
Talks about the glory of Europeans remain premature for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the fourballs test, when he paired with Alex Noren.
An extra blow and two doubles to the first nine holes have plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into such a deep pit that they were not even close to getting out of it.
Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating and deserve close follow-up due to interactions between pairs, given and undated advice and how a strategy can be modified on-the-spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this forthsome session has also shown that the US team has the motivation to continue fighting, which some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after it has finished the fourballs and forsome Saturdays with a 10-6 advantage in front of the United States.
The inspired pair composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two victories in front of an hesitant Tiger Woods, which has increased their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to win back the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made many mistakes at the mid-morning fourballs test and won the 3 to 1 series.
The US opposed a more serious resistance to the fursome test, where it won two matches, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points of the 12 simple Sunday games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, and together with Molinari, a pair named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points of the four opening matches throughout the history of the Ryder Cup.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls test, they superbly supported themselves to defeat discouraged Woods and the American novices Bryson Dechambeau with even clearer score, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two Saturday matches, had occasional genius flashes, but so far he has lost 19 of the 29 matches at fourballs and foursomes, of which seven were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's fourball session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome test and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world.
Europe did not, however, have a road without obstacles on this pleasant and refreshing day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, triple major tournament winner, and Justin Thomas became the standard for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win a 2-1 match against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs test, then came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIllroy with 4 to 3 in the foursomes test, after they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup managed a team to recover a four-point deficit in simple samples, though, because they are the current trophy owners, Furyk's players only need an equal result.
However, after being in second place two days in a row, a Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is no "opportunity" to disassemble unilaterally as long as there is no confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said on Saturday the United Nations that the extension of sanctions would deepen its confidence in the United States and that it was impossible for its country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the global council that "significant measures were implemented in North Korea to prove their good faith" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test location and non-proliferation commitment to nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see any appropriate answer from the US,” he said.
"If we can't trust the US, we won't trust our national security capabilities and, under such circumstances, we can't unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's family objections to Washington's opposition to a "scheduled" approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps gradually, his statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearisation, as the Phenian did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between a US President-in-Office and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed to making progress towards a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided guarantees on North Korea's security.
North Korea sought an official end of the Korean War from 1950-1953, but the United States said that the Phenian must first give up his nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington did not pass the demands for the relaxation of the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The US insists on the option ‘first denuclearisation’ and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive way, but even objects against ‘the declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can kneel us is an illusion that only people who do not know us have.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, to which the US leader referred to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, South Korea's president for the past five months, adding: "If the problem of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Even under these conditions, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from that of last year's speech, when he declared for the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the U.S. territory with rockets from North Korea after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "man-rake" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened North Korea last year with "total destruction", praised Kim for the courage to initiate the disarmament process, but said that work is just beginning and that sanctions will remain valid until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there is no planned period for this and added: "It doesn't matter if it takes two or three years or five months."
China and Russia say that the Phenian should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday to the UN Security Council: “The application of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without interruption until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council unanimously increased the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block the funds for the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of Phenian.
Pompeo met with Ri in the colours of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Phenian again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompei visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not work out very well.
When he left Phenian in July, he said that progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea denounced the fact that he made "Gangster threats".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “adequate measures”.
He said Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he was looking for were the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and that he wants a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to fight growing "macho" culture that makes them subject to "all night" learning sessions, energized with a lot of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that, often, students of the most prestigious universities in the world do not even master the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this type in the USA.
It was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of sleeplessness on the ability to learn.
“At the end, a girl came in and said to me, ‘Why is this being said to me just now, in the last year?’
She told me that she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she said to The Telegraph.
The course, first introduced this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance as well as the general good condition.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course may involve a number of interactive tasks.
Within a section is presented the image of a home room, and students can click on coffee cans, curtains, sports pants and cards to tell them what the effects of caffeine and light are and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive pictograms, encourages participants to think about their daily program.
"We know we can't change students' behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," added Professor Czeisler.
Culture that makes students proud that they have learned all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure imposed by students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep, of good quality, should be a "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, said this, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think that the body is hungry, which makes the students feel that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after he attended one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar study programme before enrolling in this institution where competition is successful.
Professor Czeisler advised students to schedule an alarm to know when it is time to sleep, as well as for waking time, and to know what are the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disturb the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal hits Gerrard's team
Rangers suffers from another case of depression in the move because Dolly Menga's beating condemned Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The team on Imbox wanted to win the first 4-1 victory in racing from February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to give Gerrard the second defeat of 18 games as a coach, which puts Rangers eight points behind Hearts, the leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga signed up seven minutes before the break and the uninspired Rangers didn't seem to be equal at any time.
Rangers thus fell on the sixth position in the ranking, while Livingston climbed the third place, behind Hibernian, to a difference of one goal.
And Rangers could also face other problems, because the Calum Spence coughing referee had to be treated for a head injury after an object was, it seems, thrown from the fan's lawn of the visiting team.
Gerrard changed eight players from the lot who won easily against Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 Livingstone players who managed to get an equal with Hearts last week and has every reason to be proud of the way his well-trained lot suffocated during the match.
Even though Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more effectively.
He should have scored only two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first step propelled Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's defense gate, but the middle missed a very good opportunity.
A deep shot of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
Rangers took control, but they left the impression that they hope more than they trust in their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed that he should have received a penalty when he collided with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the request of the Colombian.
Rangers managed only two hits on the gate in the first rendezvous, but former gatekeeper on Imbox, Liam Kelly, was not disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head or by Ovie Ejaria's weak hit.
Although the 34 minute goal of Livingstone did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, or only for the effort put forward.
Again, Rangers failed to prevent a deep Jacobs focus.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent out the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his temper and cared for Menga, who finished with a simple blow.
Gerrard acted on a break when he changed Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this move almost gave off immediately, when the extreme focused on Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the way to block him.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors in exactly the same kind of game he liked, with Lithgow and Halkett who intercepted focus after center.
Holt's team could have extended its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' hit, then Lithgow sent his head over the corner gate.
Glenn Middleton, reserved for Rangers, asked for a penalty at the end of the game, when Jacobs was hit, but Thomson again disagreed.

And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and count CONTINUE...), is the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as Geiger counter.
An essential device for science since then, the Geiger counter has also become essential for pop culture, as happened in the film "Clopots of San Coronado" (1950), in which they played Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the role of cowboys with an unlikely inclination to science:
Man: "What's going on?"
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these helmets, you can hear the effects of radioactivity atoms in minerals."
Evans: “Yes, I hear a lot of punches!
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before he was 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells and destroy them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, their alteration in a laboratory
They can "detect" a common protein of many cancers and then are reinjected
A test vaccine provides promising results to patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "detect" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, to extract immune cells from patients and to "learn" them to target cancer cells, has also worked to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a support diatribe of Trump, while wearing a MAGA cap, after the appearance at SNL.
Didn't come out too well
Kanye West was run off to the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a show in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he was planning to run for the 2020 elections.
After playing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, the artist broke out in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Many times when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a scene where Matt Damon played, in which Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on the charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's diatrib film was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to take West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had backlogs because of his gender.
"They tried to intimidate me backstage.
They said to me, "You don't get out wearing this cap."
I've been assaulted!
They also told me I got very low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see how far down I got?,” he said, “I'm going to get Superman's coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to evolve?
Try it with love."
His comments attracted the public hearings at least twice, and the members of the SNL team appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported; one of the members of this team said to the publication, “A complete silence was expected in the studio.”
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for the soloist Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West raised a lot of eyebrows when he played song I Love it dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits among us: Thank you that you have defeated Gloata.”
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West simply "was himself and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward someone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") about which I believe he embraces and expresses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that it is now the "queen officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; West tramples on Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of the music, Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then into the "artist formerly known as Prince".
Prosecution of attempted murder for a stab wound in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhacklove, the police said.
The defence lawyer is expected on Monday before the Belfast Court.
The charges will be analysed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Throne, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for Jon Snow's role in the series of violent medieval fantasy The Thrones Gate, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the hero macho, saying that presenting these roles on the screen makes the boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit told him that "something wrong happened" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be managed in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in Urzeala Tronuri, Rose Leslie, who is still 31 years old, admitted that it is "very determined" to talk about this issue.
"Personally, I'm very determined to talk about it now: where did I wrong with masculinity?" he wondered.
"What have we taught men about how to be adults, given the problem we are now facing?"
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for the growth of toxic masculinity by very male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What do young guys teach on TV and on the street, what makes them think there has to be a certain type of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because it's clear that something wrong happened to young people."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not play in any way a series based on the Urzeala of the Thrones after the series ended in the summer of the next year, saying that “he finished with the battlefields and horses”.
Since November, Kit will play in a new production of the True West Theatre by Sam Shepard, which presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a stripper.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him due to the series of Thrones Urzeal is that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife when I did this show, so she assured me of the future of my family and my life from now on," Kit said.
Rose played in the role of Ygritte, girlfriend of Jon Snow, the character played by Kit in the fantasy series winning several Emmy prizes.
The couple married in June 2018, on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in the number of new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, say Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From one year to another, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission are derived from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has disclosed the data to Republican Party senators, talks about "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of his team posted personal information on three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democratic claimed that the charges are made by analysts and websites of the "extreme right".
"Minciuni, lies and other miserable lies," Waters said in a Twitter post.
The information disclosed included Senators' addresses and personal telephone numbers. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on the allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed judge at the Supreme Court.
The information leak took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and presented information to a Waters team member, Hill reported.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“Member of the team whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including by the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he does not have the temperament needed to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, he doesn't have to be angry.
He doesn't have to be a challenger.
They must not question the motive of the accused.
It must be calm and quiet."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters with that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticized by the Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in mid-term elections, also commented on Twitter.
“Important, if it’s true,” he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office warned “the appropriate legal authorities and entities about these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will respond to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members."
Review Johnny English hits again: free parody of spy movies, with Rowan Atkinson in the main role
It has become a tradition to search for meanings associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new movie in the series of parodys of action films that has as main character Johnny English, the series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English returns.
Will this daring satire of how strange we are to become the nation's new export opportunity?
However, by Johnny English, the incompetent spy with eyes staring and rubber face, was renewed for the second time the license to ruin everything. The name of the character means, first of all, that it is a general comic creation for the film audience in the English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the broken secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife top of that guy who contributed with a single note to the music theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony in London.
The character is based on the explorer and mysterious man without the country Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard commercials for TV, which left chaos behind him.
This last adventure of JE has also one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor's pallets slightly hit his helmet.
The gift Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but the humor is quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" films, such as the series 007 or Impossible Mission, confidently provide comic moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to address more children than adults and, for me, Johnny English's wild adventures are not as inventive and smart as Atkinson's silent movie gangs when playing Bean's role.
As usual, the premise always is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated the supersecret web network of British spies and revealed the identities of British agents undercover, to the despair of the service agent, a regrettable small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister pompous and under siege, who is already suffering a serious crisis due to the fall in political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything she can with his character like Thera May, but the script gives him no chance to shine.
Its intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so they need to activate a reserve agent.
This is Johnny English's Zevzek himself, now working as a teacher in a high-class school, which also teaches lessons on how to be undercover. Here are some nice gags, because English runs a spy academy in the School of Rock style.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency session, then is reunited with his former partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, in which the talent of Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So, these Batman and Robin created the messes in His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing the beautiful mortal woman Ophelia Bulletova, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a charismatic billionaire of the technological industry that claims he can solve Britain's IT problems: the Jason Volta disaster, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start in a odyssey of burlestic adventures: disguised in waiters, setting fire to a fashion French restaurant, creates chaos when sneaking aboard Volta's luxury boat, then English triggers pure-shaped anarchy when trying to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to get acquainted with Volta's home.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but, however cute and colorful, it seems to be a television production for children.
A fairly mediocre movie.
As in the case of other Johnny English films, I can't stop asking myself: Can't the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role to measure his talent?
Farmers deny that they plan to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would work only four days a week, but would have been paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants the bosses of the companies to take advantage of the possible savings due to the artificial intelligence (IA) revolution by giving the employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not have changed.
The sources say the idea would be “matched” with the party’s economic agenda, which wants to tilt the balance in favour of the workers.
The shift to the four-day working week is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way that workers can take advantage of changing the economy.
A source of Labour Party leadership said for The Sunday Times: “The policy review announcement is expected by the end of the year.
It did not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a good aspiration to approach the economy's rebalancing party in favour of the worker, as well as the overall strategy of the industry party."
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of Green Party's promises in the 2017 campaign for general elections.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party.”
The Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of the Labour Conference last week to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power from "faceless" and "profit" from utility companies.
The plans of the Lord's Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet also refer to the fact that current shareholders of the water supply kings may not recover their full shares, because the Labour Government may receive "deducts" due to detected crimes.
It also confirmed plans to appoint workers to the board of directors of companies and to create ownership funds by which to transfer 10% of the equity of private sector firms to employees, which will receive annual dividends of up to about 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in the "60 Minutes" show if Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI would make him change his mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges brought by Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his candidacy as a judge in the Supreme Court at least one week and raised the question whether Republican senators might be persuaded not to support him because of the FBI's findings.
In an interview on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make him change his mind.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
“I said this from the beginning of the audience; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was determined, promptly, unequivocally."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be carved into stone.
"I'm determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so there'd be some explosive charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly rejects the accusations," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“ None of the persons named by it confirmed the account.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt that anything will change."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen's Festival, an annual music event in which an impressive group of stars will participate, with an equally impressive mission: the elimination of world poverty.
In the seventh edition, the Global Citizen's Festival will attract tens of thousands of people on the Central Park, not only to pursue artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket at the event (except if they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to pay for a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that help increase awareness of the global poverty elimination target.
But what success has the Global Citizen's Festival had when it's only 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called "clicktimism", a concept that refers to people who feel they have done something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been recorded from its supporters, which have promoted different objectives.
The organization says that these actions have driven world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was talking about 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, in which at least $10 billion had already been spent or heavily spent.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and intermediaries who have committed themselves to “help children grow up to their full potential”, which promised to offer Rwande $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition become only a footnote in the history book," Tracey Ullman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions have been taken in Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it will finance the The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website: "What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great moves for civil or anti-apartheid rights that took place before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will be performing this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use naval forces for a “block” that would hinder Russian energy exports, says the Secretary of Internal Affairs
Washington may, "if necessary", appeal to the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, revealed US Secretary of Internal Affairs Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where it acts at the legitimate government's invitation, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason I am in the Middle East is that I want to intermediate the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe as well as in southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
"The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy does not come out on the market," he said.
Zinke addresses the participants at an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the USA.
It continued by comparing the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying about Russia that he "knows only one trick" because of the economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "undecided" North Stream 2 gas pipeline project which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline, at 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said that US fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we look at things the same way: energy can't be a pressure instrument and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian energy minister, after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third state intervening in our energy issues," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "thinks seriously" to run the 2020 presidential elections, says the Massachusetts senator
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said Saturday he had to "think seriously" if he could run for presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
During the meeting at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering an application.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our broken governance, and for that it takes a strong woman," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I'll think seriously about running for presidential elections."
Warren had something to say about President Donald Trump during the city hall meeting, saying that he "led the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a post posted on Twitter Friday, Warren said "normally we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that even the majority of Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such an application.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidacy and 48% are against it.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said it would be officially decided by January, he reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the posttraumatic stress syndrome Track Palin suffers at a Donald Trump rally.
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case
"The things that my own son is going through, through which he has gone through after his return... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress syndrome and the follow-up of wounds that our soldiers return to," said the public gathered at a rally to support Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "returned a bit different, tougher, wondering if there was further respect for what they and their soldiers in the armed and air forces, as well as all the other members of the Army, did for the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of an act of domestic violence and the possession of a drunken firearm, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of the police department in Wasilla.
18 States and the Columbia District contests a new policy on asylum applications
Eighteen states and Columbia District support a legal challenge to the new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims trying to escape violence caused by gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and District have completed a friendly request curiae Friday in Washington to support a challenge to asylum seekers policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions process that the American Civil Liberties Union launched in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He said that her partner "and his violent, gang members," abused her, but the US officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was held in Texas.
The state attorney who represents Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produced a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing a widespread problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has annulled a 2014 decision of the Council for Appeals of Immigrants that has allowed immigrants without acts trying to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy " ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"The Federal Law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation violates this principle," writes the amicus curiae.
In addition, lawyers argue in demand that the policy that refuses immigrants' entry affects the US economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and 'provide the necessary labour force'.
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General, ordered judges for immigration cases in June to stop granting asylum to victims who are trying to escape abuses and gang violence.
"The asylum is granted to those leaving the country driven by persecution or fear of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political opinion," Sessions said on 11 June when he announced politics.
The role of asylum was never to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the number of deaths doubled, in a race against timer to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more and more serious.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who aligns her baby suffering from fever at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient."
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded goods, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, were overcome by the situation.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures in the spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are treated outdoors due to strong and continuous repetitions.
He has eyes full of tears when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“ We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "abuse" of "propaganda claims"
A week after an official newspaper in China published a four-page advertisement in a US newspaper praising the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, US Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using American media to distribute propaganda material.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the supplement paid by China in Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 elections for Congress, an accusation that China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to get involved in the US elections marked what US officials said for Reuters that it is a new phase in a Washington climbing campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish trade-promoting advertisements, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an increasing trade war, which involves surges in import tariffs.
The rates imposed by China as revenge, at the beginning of the commercial war, were created to affect exporters from States such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, said experts from China and the US.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former Governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published on Sunday in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "continues this abuse by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press".
"When propaganda spreads through the publication of a commercial in Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition of freedom of expression and free press in America," Branstad writes.
"In return, at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing you will find few voices of the dissidents and you will see no real reflection of the divergent views that Chinese citizens have on the worrying economic trajectory of China, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that “one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish” his article, although it did not say what newspaper it was about.
Republicans alienate female voters before mid-term elections due to Kavanaugh scandal, alert analysts
Because many of the top Republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, by several charges of sexual abuse, analysts warned that there would be a counter-reaction, especially on the part of women, during the upcoming elections from the middle of the term.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely powerful, and most Republicans who discussed it publicly intend to continue the vote.
"The reaction will not be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he has doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation will calm the angry electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesman of the progressive group, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protestors chanted "Come November!" as they demonstrated in the Senate halls when the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very great," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site.
"People say they were already very big and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, between 18 and 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed the charges of sexual abuse brought to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that it might follow a counter-reaction if republicans continue the confirmation process.
"This turned into a mess for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not only about the vote in the committee or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh being confirmed, but also about how the Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities, an electoral support group of the Democrats, for the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be relatively divided about the part that they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony: a little more seem to believe the latter.
A new survey carried out by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents strongly believe or believe that it is likely that Ford's testimony was true, while 35% said that they strongly believed it or that it is likely that Kavanaugh's testimony would be true.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's accusations, as well as at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh abused her, in a state of drunkenness, at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee at the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs to her face while attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor World Wide Web plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "global dominance".
"Now we have to do it," he talked about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data archive" or PODs.
It may contain lists of contacts, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in one browser, all of a sudden.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this "personal consolidation through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt will contribute with adequate resources, processes and skills, so that Solid will be available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely upside down at once.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even after Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The clergy who won the Victoria Cross in the First World War are celebrating
The only Anglican church clergyman who won a Victoria Cross medal as a fighter in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918 in the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attack.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he was awarded the highest military honor of Britain.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren during the Rushden parade, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "symbolic" that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "with a very heavy fog and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with "a fantastic bravery", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked alone a nest of artillery and succeeded in eliminating three weapons of detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were “a thing I know I will never be able to equal, but that makes me feel indebted.”
This, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him."
The MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206, but they got cartoons with Peppa Pig instead
Imagine that you've been up all night watching Bellator 206, an event with lots of stars, just so you couldn't follow the main event.
The San Jose event programme contained 13 struggles, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, British spectators were amazed when the transmission was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not satisfied at all, because they stayed awake all night to watch the fight.
One fan described on Twitter the move to the cartoon for children as “a kind of stupid joke.”
"Government regulations say this content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to change to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of the Bellator for Marketing and Communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future, they will program their events in such a way that they can also be followed by spectators from Britain.
"When I think about replays, I think we might probably figure it out," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won't be able to do that until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, I thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We'll sum up to five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We've tried to give the fans more and we've exceeded the limit.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling that everyone is inferior because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until he got to school that "not everyone is like me."
Invited to the first Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne, on Radio 4, he said he talks about gay people's rights to give them hope.
The sportsman also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presentation of the tradition show, will be missing for a few months because of a disease.
Invited in the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when I was a child, I felt "less" to others because "it was not socially acceptable for me to like boys and girls."
He said: “So far, these feelings of inferiority and feeling different were the real things that gave me the strength and strength to gain success.”
He wanted to prove he's "someone," he said, so don't let everyone down when they finally find out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent supporters of LGBT campaigns and has taken advantage of the appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live free, without a trace, and because he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-year-old World Champion said he was “surprised” by the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married last year the winner of the Oscar Prize, which is 20 years older than him, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he participated in the first Olympics when he was only 14 years old, and his father died of cancer after three years – he said, it’s hard to find someone of the same age who had been through the same good and bad moments.
The two became, in June, the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who, says Daley, changed his "whole perspective".
"If I had been asked last year, I would have been interested only in winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if he had received tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be first.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you couldn’t be first, Dad’,” he said.
“I was holding him by the hand when he stopped breathing and only after he had no breath and died did I finally accept that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that I had dreamed of a whole life, to jump in front of the spectators in my country at the Olympics, there was no feeling more beautiful," he said.
This inspired him also in the chosen music, Proud by Heather Small, songs that encouraged him before the Olympics and still thrills him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, was passed on the reserve bank Saturday, in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday, when he's playing in the forty-seven matches in the Ryder Cup, but he's going to have to get back to a good shape so it's not an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was passed on to Captain Jim Furyk's reserve bank for fourballs and forsome Saturdays.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as was often the case for the United States team, the winning major tournament cvintup divided its day between being the cheerleader for the team and exercising its shots, hoping that it would correct what was wrong.
The 48-year-old player never had the rightest drives, not even in the best time of his career, so it's not the best choice for the narrow terrain of Le Golf National, where long areas of Rough often punish wrong shots.
And if the field is not a big enough challenge, in the ninth Sunday match Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion, who joined the novices Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches of the week.
Mickelson's match could prove to be absolutely crucial for Americans, led by four points at the entrance to the 12 simple matches, which must start force at this stage.
Furyk declared himself confident in his player's ability, but he couldn't have said anything else anyway.
"He fully understood the role he had today, beat me on the shoulder, hugged me, and told me that he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has made a great contribution to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he'd play in two games.
I've imagined more, but that's what happened, and that's how we thought we had to proceed.
He wants to play like everyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has not risen to the level of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games won, 20 lost and seven half, although Furyk said his presence has brought some intangible advantages to the team.
"It's funny, it's sarcastic, it's smart, it likes to joke with the players, it's a great guy in the team locker," he explained.
"I think young players are having fun joking with him, it was fun to see them do that during the week.
Its role is more important, it's not just about playing."
The captain of the team of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the considerable advance could disappear soon.
Thomas Bjorn, the Captain of Europe, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the simple trials in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a uncomfortable journey.
The Dane began in the 1997 Valderrama match, when the team led by Captain Sive Ballesteros led the Americans with five points, but only if he managed to defeat them with a minimum difference, from 1411⁄2 to 1311⁄2.
"I remember having a considerable advance at Valderrama; I had a big advance at Brookline, where I lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely won," Bjorn said after following the 2018 team, who won 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now leads 10-6 to Le Golf National.
"So, history shows me, me and my team, that it's not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at maximum speed.
Let's get out on the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is only ready after the points are passed on the table.
We have a goal and that is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
We always said, we have to focus on the 12 players on our team, but we know what we expect on the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted at the way his players managed on a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I’m not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow's a different situation.
Tomorrow, individual performance is important, and this is different.
It's great to be on the field with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested to the fullest, as a golfer.
This is the message you have to send to the players, that they must be in the best shape tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as well as they can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the opponent's captain, hopes his players will play better at the simple test than they did with partners except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such returns on the last day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then on the losing one when Europe succeeded the "Medina Miracle".
"I remember every word," he answered when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had succeeded in encouraging his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick victories, like at Brookline, as at Medina.
When inertia develops in a direction, put a lot of pressure on those middle games.
We created the right lot and ordered the players as we would like, you know, we try to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of leading the fight: he will face Rory McIllroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
"I chose this group of players, in this order, because I think it covers all the subjects," Bjorn said about the lot for simple proof.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
Germany's newest fleet of naval forces should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace the warships of the Cold War, but this will only happen once a year, due to defective systems and rising costs, local press reported.
The entry into service of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", the standard ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but problems arising after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Military Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old frigates in the Bremen class.
It is expected that they will be fitted with a strong gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vas missiles, as well as stealth technologies, which provide a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new frigates to be able to leave for two years without returning to their original port.
However, continuous delays mean that these last-generation warships, which are said to increase Germany's maritime strength, will already be aged before entering into service, notes Die Zeit.
F125 striker was discussed in the press last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the naval site Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
There is not much information available on the reasons for the refusal, but the German media has cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that would have made the warship useless on a battle mission.
The software defects were especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews on the oldest frigates in the Bremen class.
In addition, it was shown that the vessel was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the military capacity to add future equipment.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton vessel "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as hard as the vessels used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the default mechanisms, and the price of the entire project, including that of crew training, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the latest frigates are of particular importance in view of the latest warnings that say Germany's maritime power is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense commission in the German parliament, acknowledged that the Military Navy "has begun to run out of vessels that can be sent to missions".
The official said that the problem has grown steadily over time because old vessels have been removed from operation without being replaced by new ones.
It deplored the fact that none of the rubble in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class had entered into operation in the Military Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New researches that are carried out on a Scottish Highlands property want to reveal how they use the surrounding bats to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these fledgling mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will analyze common dwarf bats and pygmy bats, as well as ear bats and water bats in the Inverew Gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be located in key locations around the property to track bat activity during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using manual detectors.
Specialised audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of bat sounds and how species emit certain sounds.
They will be produced and a map of habitat and a report, to create a detailed, scaled picture of their environmental behavior.
Rob Dewar, a consultant on nature conservation for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grass, and which is the best way to maintain forest pastures for bats and other associated species.
The bat populations in Scotland and throughout Britain have dropped considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects their nests, but also by loss of habitat.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, as are musk traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also attacks on domestic cats.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated greening technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is very serious about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who conduct regular studies, control nests and sometimes perform rescue missions.
The organization created even the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland, on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where there are eight out of ten bat species in Scotland.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here, in Three, the area is wonderful for bats," he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to multiply."
It stresses the importance of looking for bats before doing property maintenance work, as simply unintentional destruction of a mother nest could kill up to 400 females and chicks, which can destroy all the local population.
Lilies are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officially Scottish in the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how populations evolve for many of our species.”
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape while lawyers prepare to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said that the charges against him are "fake news" and that some people "wanted to advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and the Juventus team was accused of raping a woman from America, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
A few hours after the accusations were published, in a video posted on Instagram Live for his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, aged 33, said they are "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today are fake news," said the winner of the Gold Ball in front of the video camera.
"I want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on account of these charges, which they called "an inadmissible report of suspicions that hold private life", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the player will seek compensation for “moral damage equivalent to an appropriate amount for the gravity of the act, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in an apartment at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal, according to documents filed at the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he was “a good boy” in proportion to “99%”, and that he was betrayed by that “a percentage”.
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
Majorga claims that he addressed the police and that the photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but then accepted an understanding outside the courtroom because she was “terrified by the possibility of revenge” and was worried that “will be publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old woman now seeks to cancel that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack he was accused, Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain would "regard forever" loss of car producers
Britain “would regret forever” if it lost its position as world leader in car production after Brexit, said the Secretary for Business Greg Clark.
He added that it is "anxious" that Toyota UK told BBC that, if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, where the brands Auris and Avensis of Toyota are manufactured, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"It seems to me that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Mr. Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director in Burnaston.
Other UK car producers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they are afraid of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that, after Brexit, it will close the factory in Oxford where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call risks associated with the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota production line works on the basis of the time-fix principle: for machines manufactured on command, the pieces arrive at 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems may arise at the border, which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a deficit of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more inventory for a day at its Derbyshire factory, says the company, so the production would be stopped.
Clark said that the Chequers plan of the Theresa May for future EU relations is "precisely calibrated to avoid these delays at the border".
"There must be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said for BBC Radio 4's Today show.
"The evidence from not only Toyota, but also from other producers shows that we need to continue to use what was a very successful supply chain set."
Toyota could not specify how long production will have to be stopped, but warned that increased prices could reduce the competitive capacity of the factory in the long run and ultimately lead to job loss.
Peter Tsovallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the United Union at the factory, said the members are increasingly concerned: "Experience has taught me that after I'm gone, these jobs are not coming back."
A government spokesman said: "We have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "adjourned another week", because the battle for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, continues, White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Trump's aid to Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumors of Trump's possibility of firing the Deputy Attorney General, thus endangering Mueller's independence, have been circulating in Washington's circles for months.
Early in the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last month he went to the White House, and the reports say he was about to resign.
On the other hand, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday at the United Nations headquarters at that time in New York.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the Senate's legal committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
Friday, Trump called for a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which rescheduled the vote in the whole of the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared at Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: “It has not been established once, this week, or it may be a week, taking into account all the other things now taking place in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would challenge this claim: Sanders has never had a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy with TV reporters, who liked to perform, although he added: “I don’t deny that they like to perform.”
Then he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The President participates in more questions and answers than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "I have analyzed the figures."
"There will be briefings," Sanders said, "but it seems much better for the press to have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, not to me.
We're trying to do this most of the time and you could see that we've done this many times in the past few weeks, and discussions with the President of the United States will replace press briefings when it's available."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with the dignitaries who visit him.
The press conferences granted exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this happened, with an improvised appearance, on bizarre locations, in front of the reporters assembled.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health is addressed in a letter to EU employees at the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland on concerns related to Brexit
The State Secretary wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Parliament of Scotland, sent the letter under conditions of less than six months until the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to bear the costs for applications to receive permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, waiting for decisions to be taken in this autumn.
But the United Kingdom government has begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement to leave the EU.
I know it's a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleges in the European Union, but also outside the EU, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also bring benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after having suffered a head blow
The founder of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after he suffered a head shot on Saturday, in the game his team lost in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores team, with the score of 31-27, Mike Organ from Tennessee said.
Chief Coach of the Tennessee State team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the hit took place shortly before the break.
"It reached the cough line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Abercrombie's mask of oxygen was put by physical preparations and medical personnel on the cough line, before sitting on a plate and transporting it from the field for a detailed assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris at WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie came out of the operation he was subjected to at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is still no details of the type/width of the accident” and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in the year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make five plates in total before leaving the game, reaching a number of 18 plates throughout the season.

The change will be considered an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young people with the right to vote, promising more expensive houses and targeting people with higher incomes.
The higher tax on stamps will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not taxpayers of taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money obtained in this way will be used to support government efforts to help homeless people.
The surplus, which adds to the current tax on stamps, including the high levels two years ago for the second property and properties purchased for rent, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to bring up to £120 million a year.
About 13% of new properties built in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Several prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend a great deal of time outside the country.
The new policy is only a few weeks since Boris Johnson asked to reduce the tax on stamps to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices as a result of the acquisition of land without using them and asked Theressea May to give up the fees for affordable houses in order to solve the UK 'home problem'.
Corbyn has announced a number of proposals for attractive real estate reforms, including rent controls and the cessation of unmotivated evacuations.
He also wants to provide the Councils with greater powers in building new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my premier’s mandate to fulfilling the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And that means to remedy the problems that exist on the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with headquarters abroad, are able to buy homes as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become a much too distant one, and living in unworthy conditions is too real."
Jack Ross: “My final goal is to be the manager of Scotland’s national team”
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said that "his final goal" is to become, at some point, the manager of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scots enjoys the challenge of "reviving" the North-East Club, currently in the First League 3rd, with a three-point difference from the first place.
He moved to the Light Stadium team this summer after he managed, last season, to return the St. Mirren football team to the first Scottish Premiership division.
"I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We got to the B team of the national and about that," Ross told the BBC Scotland for Sportsound.
"But I spent a lot of my childhood watching Scotland's games at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only take part in this opportunity if I succeed as the club manager."
Ross' predecessors, as managers of the Sunderland Club, include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of the Alloa Athletic club said he has no emotions to be the successor of such consecrated names and to such an important club after he refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing that concerns me and that could affect my success is the question "Can I help this team return to the Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow it to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to make her get there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the club's return to the Premier League."
Ross has only been in charge for three years, after a period when he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the Hearts training staff.
Then he helped the Alloa club recover after it retrograded into Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from the retrograde, helping the team win the championship title next season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a decisive moment," he said about taking over the Alloa club.
"I really thought my role as manager was more appropriate than the role of the player.
Maybe it sounds weird, because we had a good time, we won well and we had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them every week.
I deal with similar situations as a manager, with regard to stress and pressure, but I feel that it is the right role for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now, that I can do this, I feel that it's the thing that fits me best in my entire adult life."
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, 30 September, between 12:00 and 13:00 at the Sportsound show at Radio Scotland.
The ideal time to drink a pint of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a poll
The heat wave this summer led to an increase in income in UK pubs, but putting more pressure on restaurants chains.
According to figures, pubs and bars recorded an increase of 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the representative of the CGA company that provides business consultancy services and carried out the survey, said: “The constant heat and participation of England in the World Cup over a longer period than expected contributed to a printing press in July, similar to that of the previous month, when the pubs registered up to 2.8 percent more customers, while restaurants had a worse period.
The number of customers less than 1.8% in the restaurants industry in June dropped even more in July.
Pubs and bars serving only drinks have recorded a much higher profit than restaurants.
And the pubs serving food have recorded heat losses, but not as large as those of restaurants.
Looks like people just went out to town to drink drinks.
Drink sales at all bars and pubs grew by 6.6% this month, and food recorded a 3% drop."
Paul Newman, RSM's representative who provides services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have observed since the end of April.
The weather conditions and the impact of sports and social events of scale remain among the most important factors contributing to the sales of the market for advertising OOH.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to record losses, although the fall in sales by 4.8% years will be added to current cost pressures.
Long summer canicular could not come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide if the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the reduced number of newly launched locations.
The company that monitors the sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over £9 billion, which is the official standard in the industrial sector.
One of five children has a secret account on a social networking network they hide from parents
According to a survey, one in five children, some even up to 11 years old, has a secret account on a social network that parents and teachers hide from.
A survey of 20,000 gymnasium students revealed an increase in the "false Insta" accounts
News has increased fears about sexual content posts
20% of students said they have a "principal" account that parents have
One in five children, some even up to 11 years of age, creates an account on a socialisation network that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 gymnasium students revealed a rapid increase in "false Insta" accounts, referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
The news has increased fears about sexual content posts.
20% of students said they have a "principal" and "clean" account that parents have, but they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, noticed the posting of a teenager who asked for "violation".
According to research carried out by the United Kingdom Digital Awareness Company and the Association of Directors (HMC – Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) in independent schools, 40% of young people between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, and half of them have recognized that they have secret accounts.
The director of the HMC Association, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s alarming that so many adolescents are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers do not have access.”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletic Commission
Eilidh Doyle was chosen for the executive power-free directorship of the Scottish Atlets Commission at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated field and track athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sports activity to take advantage of the vast experience it has acquired internationally in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the community of athletes in Scotland, Britain, as well as throughout the world, and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with its inclusion in the commission," Beattie said.
Doyle also said: “I am delighted that I will be able to represent the athletes and I hope to have a real contribution and help how sports activities are taking place in Scotland.”
The American Nationality Athlete, which won 200 and 400 meters of evidence at the 1996 Atlanta Games, along with the four gold medals won at the Olympics, is now a frequent commentator at the BBC, who remained invalid after having suffered a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will decide if I'll recover or to what extent.
It was a titanic job, but I fully recovered, I learned to go again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A breast pump advertising that compares women to cows divides public opinion in the online environment
A breast-producing company has led to the division of public opinion in the online environment with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows’ milking.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be "the first silent and portable breast pump in the world", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic advertising, inspired by a music video, to present the freedom that the new pump offers to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of cow hay on a song that includes lyrics such as: “Yes, I thank myself, but I have no tail” and “if you haven’t noticed, they are not high, but my breasts.”
The refreshment continues: "I pump, I pump, I breast-feed the baby, I pump, I pump, I extract the milk from the girls."
However, the advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was the target of mixed reactions from those who viewed it, many of them stating that it brought out the “horaries” in the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, except that their children are stolen only a few days from birth," wrote one person.

Another person commented: “It’s understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added, "A very inappropriate advertisement."
Other people defended the complaint, saying it was considered a hilarious one.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if we were still breast-feeding.
The pump really made me feel like a vat.
The complaint is a little inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is brilliant," one person wrote.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny advertisement that targets mothers who use the pump (often at work or in the toilet) and who feel like cows.
It is not an advertising that commends or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they danced with discreet pumps introduced into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into a breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the possibility to hold their children in arms and even to get out of town while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, a design consultant and developer at Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
Comparing breast-feeding mothers and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what is meant by the use of a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will give.
It's not the first time the Elvie pump gets on the front page.
During the presentation of fashion creator Marta Jakubowski at the London Fashion Week, the podium showed up the mother of two children while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were secretly transferred to a refugee camp on the Texas border
The number of retained migrant children increased, although the number of people who crossed the border each month remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and tough policies introduced by the Trump administration caused the burden of placing children in sponsors.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves immigrants without documents and fear that they will endanger their stay in the country if they ask to take children.
Risks increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must register their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official of the customs and immigration authority, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who asked for the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
Subsequently, the Agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
"About 80% of the sponsors or members of the sponsor's family live illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we will continue to look for those individuals," Albence said.
In order to speed up the process of child processing, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which children must present themselves in court at one month of detention, and not at 60 days as provided for by the previous standard, according to the employees of shelters.
Many will plead for the case through a video call, not personally in front of an immigration judge, to apply for legal resident status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the more they can become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or attempts to escape, according to employees of shelters and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Advocates stated that these concerns are accentuated to a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs indicating that a child has problems are not observed due to the size of the unit.
They added that the transfer of children to the refugee camp without giving them enough emotional preparation time or to say goodbye to friends could cause trauma, which many of them are already suffering.
Syria calls for the US, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the Acting Prime Minister, said that foreign military forces are on an illegal Syrian territory, under the pretext of countering terrorism and that "the situation will be managed appropriately".
"These must be withdrawn immediately and without any condition," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, and millions of people were rooted out of their own homes.
He further stated that Damascus will continue "this sacred struggle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories".
In Syria there are approximately 2,000 military troops in the United States, which are particularly involved in training and advising the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
Also, there are more than 1,000 French military troops in the country crushed by war.
With regard to the refugee issue, Moualem said that there were favourable conditions for their return and accused "a few Western countries" of "abstaining irrational fears", which led the refugees to keep their distance.
He added: "I have called for the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return."
"Political influences are brought into a problem that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
United Nations Diplomacy affirms that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to banish the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped to avoid a large-scale assault with the support of the Syrian forces, supported by the Russians, on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and would “be eradicated”.
United Nations emissary Staff of Misture hopes to meet soon at a first meeting of a new committee of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the field for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, stating that the Committee's activities should be limited to "reviewing the current articles of the Constitution" and issued a warning on interference.
Why will you win Trump's second term?
If we were to follow this logic, Trump would be real in 2020, unless the removal procedure or scandals would close his term of office as President earlier, which a large part of the liberal audience is hoping to happen.
In this case it would be, without a doubt, “the most dramatic end of a term of office of president of all time!”
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, first-time audiences have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in early times, the Fox News TV station is being tracked on average by 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was followed by 1.7 million, and the MSNBC TV show "The Rachel Maddow Show" recorded an audience record, with 3.5 million people who followed it in the evenings when important news was broadcast.
“This is a subject that attracts the public, because we cannot understand it,” said Neal Baer, the producer of the ABC’s “Reserve President” drama series, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive field experience and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why did she ask.
"He said, "Because it makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else is broadcast on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can be whole and about the state of the global economy.
Changing the post is a luxury that only the privileged audience can afford.
However, you are not only an informed citizen when you reach the sixth hour of viewing the debate by a committee of experts in the way that Bob Woodward uses deep background sources for his book, "Fear", about Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket ("an opulent clothing item", according to The Washington Post) and the implications of the shocking descriptions of Stormy Daniels' actress's "anatomical parts" of Trump.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario in the same way.
"A lot of what it does gives you the feeling that you're looking at a reality show and feeding you with subjects every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment media group and the creator of the "As well as the lover" show, about the ever-changing distribution of daily situations caused by Trump (the launch of a battle with the professional American Football League, the praise brought to Kim Jong-Un).
You're not allowed to miss an episode, because you'll feel like you're behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week in his house on the northern shore of Kauai Island, there were 27 degrees outside and it was sun, and he was sitting inside looking at MSNBC and recording from CNN.
He could not get rid of the television, especially while Brett Kavanaugh was going to face the Senate's legal committee and decide on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember we're performing some shows that come out of common in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but apparently they were right."

External financial resources overwhelming for the tightest intermediate elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of electoral districts, which resulted in two mandate holders in an electoral race for the same function, it is not surprising that the 17th electoral district in Pennsylvania enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburg district has raced the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another executive mandate holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, now the 12th electoral district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly insurmountable with the 17th.
Electoral maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were not constitutional, being manipulated the boundaries of the districts in favour of the republicans.
The course in the 17th new electoral district sparked a competition in funding campaigns between the major funding bodies of the parties, the Congress Committee for the Campaign of Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a name known in Pennsylvania after a strong victory in special elections, of maximum audience, held in March for the 18th electoral district of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade the function was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district with a 20-point difference.
According to political commentators, the Democrats enjoy a slight advantage.
The United States took into account the criminalization of the state of El Salvador because of its agreement with China, but then dropped
Diplomas noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with the President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated Trump's leadership team.
The officials of the State Department decided to call American leaders from the diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman in a statement earlier this month, said.
But sanctions were taken only against the state of El Salvador, which received US aid worth about $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, which included reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and the high rate of unemployment and its crimes.
Since internal meetings have made progress, North American and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the return of migrants to the United States.
But until mid-September, the officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively completing any examination of the sanctions for El Salvador.
It is now planned for Vice President Mike Pence to address the conference, scheduled in mid-October, wanting to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new hard messages or sentences from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if kept anonymous.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst, who is a close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of keeping anonymous.
Study of history
The next thing that could happen is the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there is now solid evidence made public.
It also appears that Mueller is also directing its investigation into investigating the existence of a plot between Trump's campaign and Russia with regard to the attack on American elections.
If Congress changes, Trump will face the appropriate responsibility within the body, even when he is preparing to present himself to the voters and possibly a jury formed by his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that Trump's "fall" is inevitable, which is also valid for its counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that all of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make and that will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to strike a state against Hitler only if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
I failed and thus lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing a few such critical moments right now.
What if Trump resigns Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this paper that last year he suggested the President's secret registration and speculated about his incompatibility with his role as President.
Rosenstein said the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the new inquiry requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigations concerning Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed at the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in middle elections for a Congress that will take Trump's responsibility?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail after the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman of Czech origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with skyscrapers.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Player Graham Dorrans from the Rangers team is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
Thursday, Rangers will be host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory in the Austrian match, after the equally impressive Spanish against the Villarreal team since the beginning of the month, will place it on a strong position to qualify from the G Group of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow medium Graham Dorrans to play this season up to 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result to his advantage to achieve better performance.
"It was a good point for us, considering that Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old player said.
"I started the game thinking that we'll get a good result and win a point.
We could probably have signed up at the end, but, totally, I think it was a fair result.
I think they were better at the first, and we noticed better at the second.
Thursday, it will be an important night for Europe again.
With little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last game played. However, having support, we will certainly feel more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, taking into account my accidents and changes from the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; the training also goes well.
Let us hope that we will persevere, that we will leave behind the last season and that we will have good results."
Women have insomnia because of pension savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants knew clearly how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the study carried out by the Nationalwide company said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their husband/wife.
Only 10% of them said they were talking to their children about this issue.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't start this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your husband/wife and children: You can't prepare your family to provide you with the care you need if you don't make your time wishes known.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in setting costs.
Involve the financial advisor: and the financial advisor can be of real help in paying these expenses.
Your long-term care funding choices may include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses or you can ensure your own well-being – to the extent that you have the money.
Develop legal documents: meet legal issues.
Get an authority on medical decisions, to appoint a trusted person to monitor your health care and to ensure that professionals in the field comply with your wishes if you cannot communicate them.
Also consider carrying out an authority over your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid, if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that a parent of yours with an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about its medicines and allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“And it’s not all about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are in charge of it?” Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of his dog?
Draw up a plan for all these things."
A man was shot several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed-air rifle while going home after a night spent in the city.
The victim, 40-year-old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 02:30, as “accidentally shots”.
The victim failed to see his attacker.
The wounds suffered did not endanger his life, and the police called on witnesses to give statements.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities, and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase.
Due to the interruption of the communications networks, the disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area in the north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow golf course, on the western coast of the island Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated 40 years of existence when it was hit by the tsunami and earthquake.
Donggala is a regency that lies on a coast with an area of more than 300 km in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Region, an administrative region below a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture activities represent the central point of the province's economy in the centre of Sulawesi, in particular the Donggala coast region.
Mining activities for the extraction of nickel are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused the death of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of the Donggala regime, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Circle, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: on 26 December, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province Aceh, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them from Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a 6.8-degree magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale struck the south most populated Indonesian islands, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.

Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for accusations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested following charges of violence.
Palin, 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a complaint of domestic violence and in opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by police in Alaska State.
According to the police report, when a woman's knowledge of her sex tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, she took her phone call.
Palin is in police custody, at Mat-Su unit, awaiting trial, and is held on the basis of a $500 bail-free paycheck, according to KTUU.
It was presented in court on Saturday, where it was declared "100% innocent" when it was requested to plead, according to the network.
Palin faces three class A criminal charges, which means he could be imprisoned for a period of up to one year and amended by $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin's charges have been brought.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce the alleged aggression.
The case is under trial at the Alaskan Veterinary Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, involving himself in a complaint of a domestic violence crime and having a gun in his possession while he was in a state of drunkenness in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by the veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffered after being part of the military forces in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deceased people
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred outside the central province of Sulawesi, which is north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social media circulates video clips that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
The federal prosecutor wants capital punishment for the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City
The New York federal prosecutor wants capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City after which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It seems that Saipov, a 30-year-old, used a home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike track on the West Side Highway of Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on its course in October.
In order to justify the capital punishment, prosecutors must prove that Saipov intentionally killed the eight victims and intentionally provoked serious bodily injury, according to the opinion of intent on requesting the capital punishment, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both counts may receive a capital sentence, according to the court's document.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury accused Saipov of 22 charges that include eight charges of murder in support of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required a "substantial planning and premeditation", said the prosecutors, describing how Saipov carried out the act as "hateful, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaev Saipov has caused injuries, sufferings and losses to the following families and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the opinion of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a capital punishment case in New York's Southern District.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was accused of killing two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit the spying act for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg's wives were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents of the court, Saipov, Uzbek citizen, showed no regret in the days and months after the attack.
He confessed to the investigators that he was pleased with what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he felt inspired to execute the attack after he looked at the videos of the ISIS group on his phone, according to the registrar.
Also, according to the cops, he asked to open the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded innocently for the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the officials representing Saipov, said that they are “evidently disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, instead of accepting a plea of guilt with life imprisonment, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the associated trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team previously asked the prosecutor not to apply the capital punishment.
A Member of Parliament forming part of the Conservative Party submits that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the civilian army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians must “feel pressure” from Eurosceptics, following the statement of a member of the Theresa May Parliament who suggested that it should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, said to a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "come out" so far if Farage was Secretary in Brexit campaign.
However, May's challenge to the extremely divided camps was accentuated by the members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest against leaving the European Union organised in the city.
The Prime Minister tries from strengths to ensure that his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, is carried out properly, facing the attacks on those who support the European Union, those who want to remain in it and on the European Union.
The Allies stressed that it will continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and "haos".
Bone said in the event of the pro-Brexit movement "Leave Means Leave" in Solihull that she wants "renunciation of the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given the responsibility associated with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were driven by him, I was no longer in the European Union," he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the representative of the Wellingborough constituency, added: “I will support Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers plan.”
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “I have not fought in the world war to be helpful.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied the suggestions on the change of public opinion to the 2016 vote: “It’s not true that the British have changed their mind and want to remain in the Union.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party supporting Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to the voices of people.
"The public disagrees with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party will not agree with it and our activists who come out and support us, first of all, in elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message to Theresa May, she added: "The prime ministers who keep their function are those who keep their promises."
At the meeting, Nigel Farage stated that politicians should be put in a position to “feel pressure” if they are about to give up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"Try to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that "we won't let them do this."
In a message sent to the enthusiastic thanks, he added: "I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
"We mobilize the civilian army of the country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who support staying in the European Union marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners that the Conservative Party wrote against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the Conservative Party members and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for digitising customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a farce.
Brexit doesn't bring benefits," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would seriously consider running after the November elections.
According to the Boston Globe newspaper, the Massachusetts Democratic Senator spoke on Saturday about her future during a city hall meeting in the western state of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for election in November against Geoff Diehl, a member of the House of Representatives of the Republican Party, who was co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that could defeat Trump in 2020.
The afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting of citizens with voting rights using the mayor's format since Trump took over the office of president.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded that the time has come for "women to get to Washington to solve the problems of our seriously affected government, and this includes a woman's forehead."
A suspect was arrested in case of death that caused the death of Sims player from the LSU team
Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in case of death that caused the death of the basketball player Wayde Sims from LSU.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video material at the time of Friday's shooting, asking for help in identifying the man from the images.
Sims, 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the spot, that he was in possession of a weapon, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a junior player with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the original lot in the last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 recoverys per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that Mercedes team orders will play a key role in the race.
Standing on the first position in the ranking, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the box and leave Hamilton on the tail of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the boxing one shift later and came back behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to advance after a few schemes that forced Ferrari driver to leave the interior free, after making a double move to defend himself on the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race in the back of the carriage and was in the seventh place near the end of the first tour, even the day he was 21 years old.
Then he was at the forefront for a big part of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to get past Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
Finally, he stopped at boxing at tour number 44, but couldn't step up the last eight tours, Raikkonen staying on fourth.
"It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman, letting me get through.
And the team did an excellent job to win the victory in front of Ferrari and to achieve this double," Hamilton said.
A Terrible Body Language
President Donald Trump ironed Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday, in a meeting on the subject of her insistences such as that she did not facilitate the "discharge" of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, who accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly to Ford's testimony in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee, instead commenting that what's happening in the Senate showed that people are "real, immoral and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked and immoral and liars," he said.
"When you see that they published and leaked information and then say they didn't.
They're not responsible.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Dianne Feinstein if she made it easier to "scratch" the document?
Do you remember her answer?
Aaa... no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
We did this? No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent to the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "scurried" in September, but Feinstein denied that the "rescue" occurred from her office.
"I haven't hidden the charges that concern Ford and I'm not the one that facilitated the "scratch" of her story," Feinstein told the commission, according to Hill.
"He asked me to keep confidentiality and that's exactly what I did."
However, her denial does not appear to have failed the president, who commented during the Saturday meeting: "To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the most terrible body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use accusations to achieve their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power in any way possible.
Observe the wickedness, immorality, don't care who they hurt and who they have to destroy to gain power and control," the president said, according to the Mediate website.

Patrick Dwyer wrote two goals for Giants against the Dundee team
The Dundee Stars team paid for the loss of Friday from the Elite League, winning in front of the Belfast Giants team in the return game Saturday, with the 5-3 score in Dundee.
The Giants team had an advance of two goals, the shots being executed by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equaled the score before Dwyer brought Giants back to the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard equaled the score for Dundee before two goals marked by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the League of Elites this season for Adam Keefe's players, who had recovered land defeating the Dundee team on 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, Giants winning the last three matches.

An air traffic controller died after ensuring the take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero, dying after ensuring safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died and many are gone after a powerful earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several strong replicas in the area and many people are blocked under the remains of the city Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Grand refused to leave his post in the control tower at the Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which was shaking heavily.
It remained in place to ensure that flight 6321 of the company Batik Air, which is on the runway at that time, will take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed that he was about to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesperson of the air navigation service provider in Indonesia said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I prepared a helicopter to transport it from Balikpapan to Kalmantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are sorry for this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands of people, the national disaster management agency stating that access is limited in the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the number will increase, because many victims are still under ruins and we have not had access to many of them," said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters high devastated the city of Palu, on Sunday a common funeral will take place.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said to Sky News: “An ambulance brings victims every minute.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All minimals are robbed."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it might get worse."
Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the national army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?" announced CNN.
Indonesia was shaken at the beginning of this year's earthquake in Lombok, which had more than 550 dead soldiers.
Air Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now declares that a person is missing, after previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger has disappeared since the afternoon of Saturday.
He also mentioned that he is trying to find a man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional passenger details, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to recover the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Friday, authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed at the hospital Saturday and everyone was stable.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and exact order of events.
The airline and the United States Naval Forces said the plane missed the runway and arrived in a lagoon near it.
Some witnesses think the plane passed the end of the track.
American Nationality Passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane has reached a very small distance from the ground.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers were able to cross the water, which had reached the brink, and get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Naval forces said that the sailors who worked nearby for the renovation of a landing boat jumped in help, used an inflatable boat to transport people to the shore before the plane sank 30 meters below water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in accidents of some airlines registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini plane.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution closed its plea regarding the resumption of the trial for a man accused of being burned alive by a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst in the United States Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used his mobile phone records to put the actions of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, as well as his victim's, Jessica Chambers, 19-year-old, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, in contradiction with his earlier claims, according to Clarion Ledger.
The moment the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called into the witness box and confessed that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he " lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phones records indicate that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that soon after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defence will begin its final complaint on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide at the end of that day.

Another color person?!
A New York babysitter sues a couple for firing her after she received a "racist" text message.
A New Yorkian nurse sues a couple for dismissal for discriminatory reasons after she accidentally received a text message from her mother, in which she complained that she was still “a colored person”.
The couple denied that they were racists, claiming that she had sued him for "extrusion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dissatisfaction when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was colored when she presented herself on the first day of work in 2016.
"NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU A COLOR PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the gaff, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the nanny, who is African-American, did not perform her duties properly and expected to receive a Filipino nationality nanny, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day's work and sent home with Uber.
Now, she sues the couple to pay them off and asks for $350 a day for six months, the period in which they had to live with them and carry out their work, despite the fact that this is done without a contract concluded.
"I want to show them that they are not doing such things," she said Friday for the Post newspaper, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied the claims that they were racist, saying it was a normal thing to fire Maurice, because they feared they could no longer trust her after they hurt her.
"My wife sent him a wrong message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco, her husband, for the Post newspaper.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of a person you have wronged, even if it was a mistake?
The newborn child?
Let's be serious."
Considering the process an action of "extrusion", Plasco said his wife would be born in two months and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really want to take revenge on a person in such circumstances?
Don't do that," the bank investor added.
While the process is in progress, the public opinion accused the couple on the social networks, judging them for the behavior and logic they showed.
Paddington's story editors were afraid that readers would not be able to identify themselves with a talking bear, according to a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said the following about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's really funny now, after I saw that Paddington had a huge success."
He also said that his father, who was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the anniversary at the time of the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was a "merty sweet" after he died last year.
Regarding Paddington, which she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father had a discreet pride about the success he later enjoyed.
"He was quite a calm man and he didn't like to praise himself," she said.
"But, because Paddington was so real to him, it was like he had a child who had a success: you're proud of him, although it's not yours.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give Paddington the credit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
On the landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"It doesn't ring often to tell me it's very serious and he doesn't think he'll survive," Ednan-Laperuse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad telling me she's gonna die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medicines administered by doctors so that her heart would continue to pump blood began to decrease and get out of her body.
He died a short time ago and the organs began to stop working.
I had to sit there and wait, aware of everything that's going on.
I couldn't scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Ednan-Laperuse, being in mourning after his daughter's death, embarked on a plane, alongside other passengers, who did not know what was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
“I kept my head down and tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had a overwhelming feeling of sympathy with Nad.
I realized she needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two grieving women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones because they committed suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of them being motivational and including phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he started to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45-year-old, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising cook with a molybdenum smile.
"Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said his smile changed your disposition."
However, he gave up work before he died because he had reached a very unhappy moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his life.
Davis said, "I'm always thinking it'll have a domino effect on you."
He has created the messages “to pass on to people what they can call someone or anyone else. ”
Get out, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' friend of several years, lost Mark, the life partner he was 15 years old, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he’s not feeling well or depressed,” she said.
"A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he changed his attitude.
He was in a pitiful state on Christmas Day, when the children performed their gifts and didn't even look them in the eye."
She said that her death was a terrible trauma to them, but she had to overcome it: “It caused a lot of pain in the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake as a result of the initiation of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigations
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking for – an investigation for a limited time and a limited size – we could have a little unity,” Jeff Flake said Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the commission was about to “disintegrate” at the bottom of a partisan blockade.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reticence is entirely due to the temporal factor.
It is only five weeks before the November 6 elections - if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to place the one they want the winner at the elections for the highest court in the country will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush has repeatedly appealed to the senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes the report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to make a difference in the case of equality and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean fugitives falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean fugitives in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean parliamentary.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from South Korea's Ministry of Unification, said last year they fled the country about 1,127 people, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were the harsher border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates charged by those who illegally transport people across the border.
The Phenian made no public comment.
The vast majority of Northern fugitives are finally given South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarised area (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers fugitives rather illegal migrants than refugees and often returns forced.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically in the war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenian for a few discussions that had the subject of negotiations on denuclearization.
This took place after the historic meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-one from Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate for a Korean nuclear-weapon-free peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused that U.S. sanctions have caused the lack of progress since then.
"If we cannot trust the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and, in such situations, in no case will we be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "theist," saying he is unable to serve the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court as "theist" and said that his temperament is inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelossi made the comments on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared "steric," Polisi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's legal commission, which took place Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the charges of sexually harassing Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screamed and lost his voice because of the emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "a grotesque and coordinated murder of character", organized by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony had proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think it's disqualifying with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelossi deviated from the subject when asked whether he would try to suspend Kavanaugh if he would be confirmed and whether the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I just want to say this: if you don't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it's not right, not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which you are now," Polisi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Columbia District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Accessible Care Act or the Roe versus Wade case, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be overturned.
“It’s not the time for a hysterical, supportive person to go to court and expect us to say, “Oh, how wonderful!,” Pelosi said.
And women must be able to handle it.
It's a justified diatribe, it's months and years of accumulated rage and can't speak without bursting into tears.
"We cry when we get angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continued: “I received a significant help from a woman in an executive function, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique according to which, when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: “You might think I’m sad, because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then continue.
I thought it was a great thing."
Tears are allowed for the exteriorisation of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a man-dominated office, where I started to cry because of an inexpressible rage, is that I was hit by the head of an older woman, a cold director who I always felt a little afraid of, and took me to the stairs house.
"He must never see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad they caused this feeling to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Colorado State Congress, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought he had no reason why he should not run for the presidency.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," she says laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to the situation as "White as Snow and the seven dwarfs".
Because the campaign was at the end, she was behind the fundraiser and swore she wouldn't go in the race if she couldn't collect $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who had given them $1,000 men, they only gave her $250.
"Do they think I get discounts?" she asked.
During his speech he announced that he would not officially launch a company, he was so affected by emotions – as a result of gratitude for the people who supported it, frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also anger caused by gender discrimination – that he lost his voice because of the emotions.
"You said I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls about the reaction of the press to her.
"You would have said that one of my sponsors is Kleinex."
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my funeral stone.
"Did she cry?"
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial to Beijing?
The Saves that announced the beginning of the trade war between the United States and China were shocking and, although there seems to be a long way to end it, the disputes between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued the first warning early this year, by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new taxes, which affected products worth 200 billion dollars (£150 billion), effectively applying half of all Chinese goods arriving in the United States.
Beijing has avenged each time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5 and 10 percent for US products worth 60 billion dollars.
China has warned that it will respond to every blow from the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree with its demands, but public surrender to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, China's President.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the United States on trade war could support China positively in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would, in fact, be more dangerous than expected so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a group of experts.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, said Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria affirms that it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the conditions on the spot are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists so that things are back to normal.
Existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were required to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at day-to-day life and their lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country in 2011, when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be pleased to receive aid in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from countries sponsored by the insurgency would not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder 2018 Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the edge of Paris, France.
The United States has now registered the sixth consecutive win in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned first after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn obtained 14.5 points, necessary to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who made incredible efforts in most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial hit in the water to hair 3 of the hole 16, giving way to Francesco Molinari's match.
The Italian golf player Molinari had an incredible performance in all the games, becoming one of the four players with a result of 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament has existed since 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost to holes 5 and 4 in front of the player at the top in the ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen in Denmark.
The first player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost in holes 2 and 1 in front of Ian Poulter in England, which is probably his last match in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful player in Europe, with an average of 25.5 points in his entire career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a hard year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm extremely happy that I could win the cup again.
It's a team job and I'm glad we could help," Garcia said excitedly after the European victory.
He handed over the flag to his fellow citizen, John Ram, who beat Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, to holes 2 and 1, to the individual game on Sunday.
"I'm very proud that I beat Tiger Woods. I used to watch his games when I was a kid," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record at the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being outnumbered only by Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team has put a real effort on the golf course, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great during the entire tournament.
American team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of them, they have even worked.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've had a fight.
Lower your hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to give them proper respect.
They played better than we did."
