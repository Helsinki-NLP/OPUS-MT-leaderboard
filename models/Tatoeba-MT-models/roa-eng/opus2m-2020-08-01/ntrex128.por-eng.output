Members of the Wales Assembly are afraid to "pass by Marretas"
There is a dismay on the part of some Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) regarding the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Deputies of the Welsh Parliament).
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Galk Parliament".
Some members of this House, coming from all political colors, fear that this will cause them to fall into ridicule.
A Labour AM stated that the group is concerned that "the designation rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For non- Welsh readers: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excrement".
An AM from Plaid said that the group as a whole "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative Member of Wales said that the group was "open-minded" about the change in the name, but said that the designation MWP was verbally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a similar pronunciation to that of the letter u in Yorkshire.
The House Committee, currently drafting legislation to introduce the name amendments, said: "The final decision on how Members of the House are designated will obviously be taken by themselves".
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave its assembly the powers to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which received widespread support for the proposal to appoint the Assembly as the 'Galese Parliament'.
On the issue of the title of the AM, the Commission favoured "Deputies of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to bring consensus together may constitute a headache for President Elin Jones, who should present a draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way in which the House carries out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AM and the configuration of the committee system.
When they discuss the legislation, the AM will have the final word on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians will refer to change of country name
The voters will vote on Sunday on the change of the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a conflict of decades with neighboring Greece, which integrates a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of its neighbor to the north constitutes a complaint about its territory and has repeatedly raised objections to its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is no more than the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
Sinos de St. Martin shut up at a time when the churches of Harlem fight for survival
"In a historical perspective, the elderly I spoke to told me that there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is neither one nor another."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, was understood.
"People socialize differently" today, I said.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms in the neighborhood where people go regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money earned with the sale of heritage does not last as long as the leaders expect" and that sooner or later everything will return exactly to the point of departure".
The churches, he added, can be replaced by buildings of apartments with condominiums inhabited by the type of people who will not support the shrines of the neighborhood that remain.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and, therefore, such will hasten the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation came out in the 1930s.
The building was later set up by a black congregation that carried out its worship nearby.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the 125th Street shopkeepers, an important commercial street in Harlem that resisted the hiring and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged. However, when they made plans for their reconstruction, Father Johnson’s parishioners ordered the wagon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the wagon "the bells of the poor".
The specialist who played the wagon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and an "invincible historical instrument".
This specialist, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also mentioned that he was the world's first chariot to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the largest chariot in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that this "would seek to pass on the costs to it", despite the fact that it was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark causes 13-year-old teen injuries in a lobster hunting dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster hunt in California on the first day of the lobster season, the authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour how much he heard the boy scream for help, and then rowed in his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but then realized that the boy was yelling "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The whole area of the clavicle was torn apart, described Hammel what he observed when he came to the boy.
"Call everyone out of the water, "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was airborne to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles stated in a press release that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the trunk.
The authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for research and security reasons.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetics sections like big warehouses, supported by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to earn a share in the UK cosmetics market, valued at 2.8 billion pounds, which has continued to grow as sales of fashion clothing and household items shrink, these largest cosmetic sections will be tested in 11 stores scattered across the country and will be implemented in more stores in the coming year if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the search by supermarkets for ways to use formerly used exposure space for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would duplicate its catalogue of beauty products with the offer of up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those of Boots stores.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products obey the vegan precepts, something increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, last week. It is expected that the second, in Selly Oak, Birmingham, will open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and changing food shopping habits to small daily quantities in nearby shops have led to the supermarkets now having to make more effort to persuade customers to visit their shops.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses at a time when the supermarket chain tries to fight off the Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos sales points in hundreds of stores, having also installed a series of Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, and states that this reinforced sales of merchandise products and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The company's previous attempt to renew its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from health products stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy arises after Sainsbury's three years ago sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 points of sale to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores an extended range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and essence of our cosmetic sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the customer.
Our range of brands was designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point for the sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of making purchases".
Peter Jones "gry" after Holly Willoughby left the 11 million-pound business
Peter Jones, star of the Dragons Den, became "angried" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby abandoned an 11 million-pound business with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of items for home and Truly accessories.
The business of both had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced in Instagram that she would abandon the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the star of the Dragons Den Peter Jones led by abandoning the lucrative brand in the last minute to focus on his new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "hot" when the TV's gold girl admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at his business empire's headquarters in Marlow, at Buckinghamshire, that his new business ( whose value can be £1.5 million) meant that he would not have time to dedicate himself to his home article brand and Truly accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones would catch a plane for one of his vacation homes abroad.
One source said, "Truly was by far the greatest of Holly's priorities.
It would mean the resolution of your future in the long term and would be financial support for the next two decades.
Your decision to leave has all been absolutely startled.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of items ready to sell at Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter from This Morning, who is among the most lucrative stars in Britain, could cost the company millions, given the massive investment in products, ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and articles for the home, and the potential for additional delays in the launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, are close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp ten years ago.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined the project as president in March.
Couples take a vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador to M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter of the I'm A Celebrity ITV program.
A source near Jones said last night that "We don't want to comment on your business".
Hard conversation "and then we fell in love"
The US President jolly mentioned the criticisms that he would be the target of the media for making a comment that some would consider "indignified by a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in?
Trump said, in his fake voice, "telejournal poppy."
"I didn't give in to anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, highlighting that it would be a major step in the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for denuclearization are on the verge.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, the most important North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the US to the first steps towards disarmament in North Korea.
Instead, he said, the US continues with sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic point of view in his speech at the meeting.
"It's going very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
Trump stated that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results: the end of the rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the remains of the U.S. military.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when he spoke in his relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on an island, killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had been evicted, there was no national catastrophe, a prerequisite for the channelling of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have in many cases made it clear that they are not asking for international aid; therefore, it becomes a bit difficult," Mrs Sumuk said.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to address Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although they have been built in Aceh, Tsunami shelters are not commonly seen on other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm serum in Palu, despite the existence of a warning, had contributed to the loss of lives.
In the most favorable times, traveling among the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship parked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who made the improvement of the infrastructure decreta a central part of his election campaign, spent enormous amounts on roads and railways.
However, the shortage of funding has hit Mr Joko's executive, at a time when he is facing his re-election next year.
The president is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catans, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes a long finish for the goal of tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal at the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's beacon, with his team missing for 1-0.
He hit his left before making an end towards the second beam.
In an attempt, the ball flew high over the large area when heading to the upper right corner of the network.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga in flight and fell inside the network.
"I was just trying to reach this position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq advance as much as possible, so I was just earning as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming in, I touched and I didn't think too much about it. I just finished."
Chelsea won by 1-0 at the interval after scoring a goal at 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this play, the advanced blues gave a step of heel back to Mateo Kovacic before unmarking near the middle-field and making a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick pass to midfield.
Then he made a beautiful end that crossed the opposite defense, leading Hazard to the great area.
This went beyond the defenses and went against the network of the second beam with an end to the left foot that passed through the Alisson Becker Networks of Liverpool.
Liverpool faces Naples in the Champions League group phase at 3 p.m. on Wednesday afternoon at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. on Thursday afternoon in London.
Number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia goes up to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, declared in early Sunday the agency of response to the country's disasters.
There are reports describing a large number of people imprisoned in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves reaching 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of the buildings that collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for suspicion of murder after the stabling of a woman to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The victim, 44 years old, was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man being arrested for suspected murder.
The police have urged the population in the area who may have witnessed something to provide information.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to all those in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who witnessed something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to those who may have obtained images with flat-screen cameras, particularly taxi drivers, who contact us, because they may have crucial information for research."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was located within a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe that they knew the victim went to the scene of the incident to investigate the place where she had been found this morning.
Investigations are under way, and the police report that they are currently informing the relatives close to the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to access his apartment, but was informed by the police that entrances or exits of the building are prohibited.
When he was informed about what had happened, he ran out of words.
Residents are now being informed that they will only be able to return to their homes within hours.
A police officer was heard to tell a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene bathed in tears.
He repeatedly says, "It's so awful."
At two o’clock in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the cordon and another was parked in the area immediately outside.
A number of police officers were posted inside the cordon to monitor the apartment building.
We ask those who have information that you contact by DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers by number 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament has become the most recent monument swallowed up by the dispute of "historical revisionism"
His removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for his destruction, which recalls the perpetration by the Taliban of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madman" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that, in the current debate on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell's figure from Westminster Palace would become a target for killing.
The iconoclasty of British civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the acts of his ancestor Thomas the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testimony of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of homage.
Goldsmith told Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender against external pressures, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate description or not is the subject of a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents one side of this division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and commemoration."
Killer pig attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut and covered artery of blood, near a pocilga in the market in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, read at the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig grower prepares to inject swine vaccines into a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he has traveled with the cousin from nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door to an open neighbor's well.
At that pocilga, he said, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, with 227 kilos, had attacked the pig farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered with blood and crushed, said the cousin, referred to by his nickname "Wu", according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent him from attacking other people while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Reports state that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on his fifth in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years before, a pig with 300 kilos immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to startle the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the smell of blood can work as "stimulus".
"They're just kidding.
They like to chirp, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them due respect," he said.
Pink hurricane debris should bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening when moving on the coldest waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains all north of Mexico and southwest of the United States in the next few days.
At 5:00 a.m., Eastern Sunday Time, the Rosa caused a 137 km/h raked hurricane, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
However, a depression begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean that travels to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Baja California peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin pushing a strong tropical humidity northward in the southwestern part of the United States.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, tropical humidity interacting with depression in the vicinity will produce heavy rains generalized in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain can cause sudden hazardous floods, debris squeezings and possibly landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation that can reach 5 to 7 mm in spot areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation in areas of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly worsening conditions due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is highly unacceptable to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
Strong precipitation can make the passers-by turn into brave rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust clouds.
The approximate depression will bring with it strong precipitation over parts of the southern coast of California.
Total precipitation of more than 12 mm is possible, which may cause small debris and slippery roads.
This may be the first precipitation of the wet season in the region.
Some tropical waters will begin to occur in Arizona in late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more dispersed at the end of Monday and on Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread in the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
The month of October can record strong temperature changes throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools. However, tropical areas will remain quite mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature in short distances.
There is an excellent example of the drastic temperature differences throughout the central area of the United States on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, persistent summer heat will tend to increase and widen again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern part of the USA will record a hot start in October, with temperatures spread between 27 and 30 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates a high probability of above average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States until the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh's audience
More than 20 million people attended yesterday in six television stations to the kidnapper witness of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political impasse continued, with the stations interrupting regular programming due to a last-minute turnover: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that he was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had slapped her while she was drunk and tried to throw her away at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed witness, said he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people, reported by Nielsen on Friday, are likely to have attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of viewers in the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The numbers of the other stations that transmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen generally has difficulties in measuring audiences of those who see programs in offices.
To give some perspective, it is a level of audiences similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscar ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to the Kavanaugh appointment, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the audience that lasted all day, referred to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
Then comes CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, referred to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the cabinet of the moderate republican has issued a statement stating that his vote would be in favour of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught by the chambers of CNN and CBS on Friday morning to be verbally attacked by demonstrators when he tried to enter an elevator to address a hearing of the Judicial Commission.
The senator remained motionless to look down on the floor while he was directly criticized for the CNN cameras.
"I'm here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you have power while so many women have no power."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event directly hours later, when the Judicial Commission was voting to make the appointment of Kavanaugh to proceed to a vote in plenary session of the Senate.
However, Flake said that he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate charges against the nominee next week, which the democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after conversations with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and then with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of "doing politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plans to leave the European Union of "doing politics" with the future of Britain and of harming national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with what he gave on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the 'Checkers Plan' of the Minister for Brexit, stating that a proposal which provides for Britain and the EU to cover the charges on the other side is "totally absurd".
Homicide of Wayde Sims: Police Detain Suspect Dyteon Simpson of LSU Player's Death
Police arrested a suspect of Sims' deadly shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and charged with murder in the second degree, as reported by Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, having the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered them at the scene and declared that they had found Simpson's DNA in them, reports WAFB, a CBS subsidiary.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had fatally hit Wayde with a gun.
A bond of USD 350 000 was established, the lawyer said.
The medical-legal office of the parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head extending to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the action group of the State Police of Louisiana, the criminal laboratory of the state police, the Southern University police and residents of the area who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
The athletic director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the authorities in the area for his "diligence and effort to obtain justice".
Sims was 20.
This advanced, 1.98 m tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Its average was 5.6 points and 2.6 points per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU Will Wade said the team was "damaged" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
"That's what worries us in permanence," Wade said.
Volcano ejects ashes in Mexico City
Popocatepetl volcano ashes reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of the crater activity, which recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center has detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images on social networks showed fine layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in volcano activity, located 72 kilometres from the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook the central zone of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Confrontations between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independent protesters and the intervention police, while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan referendum on the secession.
A group of masked separatists, held by the intervention police, struck her with eggs and threw powder ink, creating dark dust clouds on streets that are normally filled with tourists.
Later confrontations also took place, in which the police resorted to sticks to counter the conflicts.
For a few hours, independent groups singing "We do not forget, we do not forgive" faced unionist protesters, who shouted "Long Life for Spain".
Fourteen people were treated with mild injuries suffered in the protests, can be read in the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region inclined to independence, one year after the October 1 referendum which was considered illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The electors overwhelmingly chose independence, although the turnout to the polls had been low, with a majority boycott of those who are against.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to block the current vote at polls spread across the region, resulting in violent clashes.
The independent groups had camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
Although it has been performed, this manifestation was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year, we live our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for voting, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a vital but tangible victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have had difficulty in maintaining the momentum this year, with their most well-known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in the referendum organization and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police protest with his cell phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders arrested for trial since last year, announced that he would be running for the European Parliament in the elections next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we see on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after hitting a car against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly collided in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage occurred in the gates and in the building itself.
At a certain point, someone may also have shot a beast against the car.
Menga Attack gives 1-0 victory to Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
The Livingston, promoted to the first division, spooked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of only two in 18 games as a technician at the club of Hemox.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changes from level to Hibernian in second place.
The team of Gerrard, who continues without a win out of the house in the first division this season, faces the Hearts leaders, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home on the European League on Thursday.
However, Livingston extended to six games his succession of undefeated confrontations in the division, with Principal Coach Holt without losing a single time since he replaced Kenny Mile last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against clumsy visitors
Holt's team should have moved ahead on the score long before the goal, because the incisive character of his game was causing all sorts of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson entered the defense, but he let himself be dragged in front of the beacon and then Alan Lithgow only managed to steer his effort away after having slipped to find Craig Halkett's headset on the beacon.
The team of the house was pleased to let Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause trouble to visitors in the ball games stop.
And it was in this way that the crucial goal arose.
The Rangers granted a free and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, which gave a touch and scored from the center of the large area.
At that point, Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but faced a defense from the impenetrable house team, and Liam Kelly's network guard had no big problems.
This pattern went on in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the Rangers' networkguard's feet, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow played away from another livenston ball game.
They continued crossings to the large Livingston area, which were successively resolved, and two complaints of great penalty, one after Halkett's investment over the Glenn Middleton substitute and another after a hand, were refused by the arbitrator.
Livingston "phenomenal" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed the expectations in this ascending trajectory.
His style of play and the staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, obtaining an extremely well organized defense while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall giving his best throughout the game.
Anyway, Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality shown at times with Gerrard, the team was far below these standards.
His final move was little inspired (only once they were able to open the house team), constituting a kind of warning for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is received ambiguously in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, whose aim was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside your country.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25 000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters were present in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, were also heard, condemning both the policies of the president and the decision of the German government to host him in the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisional character of a visitor acclaimed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, south-east of the city, about 10:15 a.m., British summer time.
The driver of the car stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died on site.
This collision occurs months after another cyclist's death in an escape collision on Childers Street, about a mile and a half of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police stated that the agents are trying to identify the person and inform their relatives.
Barriers and deviations for buses were placed, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six agents injured in disorders
Six prison officers were injured in a high-security male prison, the Prison Office said.
The disturbances, which still continue, started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 9:30 a.m., British summer time on Saturday.
Special agents "Tornado" were summoned to solve the problem, involving eight prisoners and is restricted to a wing.
Agents received treatment for small facial wounds on site.
A spokesperson for Prison Services said: "Specially trained teams have been used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it must be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they may spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, last October, intervention police officers were summoned to resolve a serious disorder in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Pink threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (areas affected by the drought may benefit)
It is rare a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but it is exactly what is expected for the beginning of next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa crosses the Desert Southwest, implying the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday, to the southern and east areas of Nevada, to the south of California and to Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take on a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching at the end of Monday with rains.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported on a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression within a radius of 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that crossed 60 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated quantities that can reach 15 mm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of total isolateds that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risk of sudden flooding, the rain of the Rosa may constitute a blessing, as the region is affected by the drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently being affected by the drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second most serious category," said the site weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will reach the continental mass across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still with hurricane force on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 km per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is weakening.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at the fall of Monday night.
Strong rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"A total rainfall of 8 to 10 mm from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora is expected, being possible up to 25 mm," said the site weather.com.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the first hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then head south of Utah in the last hours of Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected from the Rosa or her debris is the very high rainfall in Lower California, north-west of Sonora, and in the South-West Desert of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden floods of debris in the deserts, with risk of life, and flooding in mountainous lands.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three male adolescents and one 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, near 4:00, British summer time on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17 - year - old teenager, two 18 - year - olds and a 20 - year - old man in the Radstock area were arrested during the night and reported to Avon and Somerset police.
The agents appealed to everyone who could have cell phone footage of what happened.
Trump said Kavanaugh "was the victim of the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "was the victim of the malice and anger" of the Democratic party during his appointment process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, having vigorously and emotionally denied a charge by Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her for decades, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his claim.
The president stated on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brightness, quality and courage on that day.
"A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a jurist with a brilliant public service curriculum," he told the crowd of Western Virginia supporters.
The president referred later to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout at polls in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not competing, but I'm actually competing," he said.
"That's why I'm all over the world fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, told CNN a senior deputy of the leadership of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of earthquake and tsunami deaths in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami reached the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high hit the beach at dusk, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred following an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, having been victims of the success," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman for minimizing the effect of the catastrophes of Indonesia (BNPB) in a communication in Jacarta.
"The tsunami did not move alone: it dragged cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climb trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency show many buildings and destroyed shops, deformed and slaughtered bridges, and a water-encircled mosque.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by replicas on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology of Indonesia (BPPT) referred to a statement that energy released by the huge wave of Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, read in the declaration.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the rough buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage may be deeper along the coastal line 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were completely disabled and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300 000 inhabitants in the area," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities claimed that the waves emerged at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film released on social networks, you can see a man on the top floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, to the people on the street below.
In a few minutes, a water wall fell on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the filming.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power cut that interrupted communications in the Palu area, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jacarta and other cities. However, the evacuated still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo marked a visit to Palau evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia grows exponentially to more than 800.
It's very bad.
Although he managed to safely reach the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of his offices, the staff of the World Vision of Donggala went through devastating scenes on his way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began to undertake the dark tasks of assistance to disaster victims, some complained that the highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and foreign staff may only have access to the site if it is declared a "national disaster zone".
Maybe it hasn't happened yet.
"It is still at a level of provincial catastrophe," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"The way the government says "OK, this is a national catastrophe" we can open the doors to international assistance, but this status does not yet exist."
On the fall of the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that mitigate the dark blankets of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing sportsmen for the Asian Games, completed early this month in Indonesia.
Other of the prisoners at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were their students.
"As a senior paragliding practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to circulate among the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages to the WhatsApp for the sportsmen of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a gray verification mark instead of a pair of blues.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves carry 26 750 USD during automatic cash refuelling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who replenished an automatic box in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an automatic box in the amusement complex and preparing to introduce more money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, another man "survived to run behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was destined for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Those who have information about their identities should contact the Newport police through the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper renames Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41 years old, received Ye's nickname a while ago and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before your participation in Saturday Night Live, where you are expected to present your new Yandhi album.
This intervention is intended to replace that of the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled it by "emotional reasons," the creator of the show said.
At the same time as an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I believe that "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West early this year, when he commented on the title of his album with the radio presenter Big Boy.
"So, it's you, it's us, it's us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the only" for only Ye - being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is another reflection of who we are."
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known alternately by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphen and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO undertakes not to resort to military action against civilians
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel López Obrador committed himself not to use military force against civilians at a time when the country approached the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
Military fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have risen to 300, when leftist student movements were implanted throughout Latin America.
López Obrador committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double the financing of artificial intelligence
At a time when China reinforces its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research spending in this field, said the investor and professional of the Kai-Fu Lee area, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments take place after several U.S. government departments have made AI-related announcements, although the country does not have a comprehensive formal strategy in this area.
However, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead innovation in AI by 2030.
"Dualizing the research budget in AI would be a good start, since all other countries are so behind the US and we are looking for the new AI revolution," said Lee.
Doubling funding can double the chances of the next great success of AI being achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, a company that invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the best ranked American player in Othello. Later, he performed executive functions at Microsoft Research and was president of the Google branch in China.
Lee gave credit to the previous U.S. government technological contests such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Agency for Advanced Research Projects and asked when he would be next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
US researchers often have to make great efforts to obtain state funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's stealing academic leaders; it's companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired university luminaries to work in AI.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the US to boost its efforts in the field of AI.
"I am of the opinion that green cards should be automatically granted to doctorates in AI," he said.
The Chinese Council of State presented its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a manner similar to that used by the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations to finance researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Early this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, which is intended to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month an investment of $2 billion in an initiative designated by AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in AI research.
In the meantime, US legislation that wanted to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been moving forward for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on the change of the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece which blocked its applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbor to the north represents a complaint about its territory and has prohibited its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal of a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow in the ethnic identity of the predominantly Slavic Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the turnout to the polls would be sufficient to meet the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum's question was: "Is it in favour of entry into NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the change of name, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue the efforts of the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said that it would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Elections Committee stated that there had been no record of irregularities until one afternoon.
However, the influx was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters showed up to vote.
"I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a capital elector, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on the change of the country's name, which would open the doors for accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarvarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and for the EU, but we want to stick with the head and not the door of service," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can talk to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that entry into NATO will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
According to him, a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required influx.
Another survey, conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the influx must be more than 50% more than one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first important desire in the policy of the pro-Western government since it took possession of it in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero do Manchester City crosses all of Brighton's defense towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have outlawed Brighton's defense in victory for 2-0 against Manchester City on Saturday, at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
That made it look ridiculously easy on your goal in minute 65.
The state-of-the-art Argentinian received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
He performed a sprint between three Brighton defenses before cutting to reach open field.
It was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He finished a defense before neutralizing in the race others on the edge of the great Brighton area.
Then he took a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The advanced Englishman used his first touch in the big area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan's net-guard with an end on the right side of the network.
"He's still arguing with some problems on his feet," Pep Guardiola, a city coach, told reporters.
"We said he'd be playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky for him to have scored a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League confrontation.
That goal was scored at the 29th minute.
Aquiero got the ball right on Brighton's territory in this game.
Passed over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The advanced Sky Blues kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding out of the field.
The City faces Hoffenheim in the Champions League group phase at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Schézer wants to make Rockies more difficult
With the Nationals eliminated from the end, there were not many reasons to force another beginning.
However, always competitive Scherzer hopes to enter the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the Rockies, who hold a leader in a game about the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their title from the first division.
"Even if we're playing for nothing, at least we can go into the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play to the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the headline launcher for Sunday, but some say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the launches in this situation.
Scherzer, who would perform his 34th start, held a session in the bullpen on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
The right player in Washington goes with 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 tickets this season.
Trump makes a comet in Western Virginia
The president later referred to the situation involving his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of Republican influx in the interim elections.
"Everything we did is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the great, great... I'm not competing, but I'm competing and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You are seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical democrats, they are seeing it happen right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using all the necessary means.
They don't care who they hit, who they have to go over with to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have the mission of "resisting and obstructing".
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling it "aggressive, evil, deaf and lying" to the Democrats.
The President referred to the name Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judicial Committee and received sound from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you fail the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, hm no, I, wait, one - that was a body language even bad - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant to those who openly give their opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party organization voted to censure me, it wasn't a surprise to me.
At the end of the day, I am the most recent of a number of Labour Members in the parliament to whom it has been said that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in parliament Joan Ryan was the target of a similar treatment because he resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar topics to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the nottingham East working meeting on Friday mentioned that "we intend that the meetings be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, it is no longer the tone of many of the meetings and the "kindest and most kind" policy promise has been long forgotten, if ever realized.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable by the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because the colleagues with whom he thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect me to turn around and take positions with which I would never agree - either on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn't really matter what I say), there is a stream of insults on social networks that call for "department", denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one who's going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are addressed to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a dam of sexual or racist insults every day, but who never turn back to them.
One of the aspects that most disappoint me in this age of politics is how these levels of insult have become standardised.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have stopped being inclusive, and with each motion of "censorship" or modification of the rules of selection the party narrows its views.
I have received numerous advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head low, not to be so expressive, and that it would do everything right for me.
But that's not why I came to make politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the negligence of Thatcher's government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in rubble, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most, either as auturate or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policies, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somewhat confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country goes to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy on the subject of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Momentum of Nottingham; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "department" or political files will prevent me from acting in the sense of what I believe to be the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late essays somehow sent the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this incredibly interesting game of Tennant's Premiership of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of ten without defeat.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the home team bring the best, and Coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The merit goes to Ayr. They managed the risks better than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute trial, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr on the front, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, handed over to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to give expression to the numbers, having Jason Baggot taken advantage of an unconverted essay.
Climo extended the advantage of Ayr with a great penalty, before, immediately before the middle-time, having marked and then converted a ground test to place the marker number 17-5 for Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose began well the second part and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
A long interruption was followed due to a severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was transported from maca to the outside and, after the restart, Ayr reinforced the leadership with a trial of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The captain of the Ayr in exercise, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense pressure investment.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for overthrowing Climo without the ball, in the release of penalty, MacPherson placed the ball on the ground behind the maul in progress of Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the reinitiation, after Kyle Rowe had picked up David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregor Henry's wing to the fifth rehearsal of the home team.
Still Game Star ready for a new career in the restoration business
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, seems ready to enter the catering sector after knowing that he was appointed director of a licensed restoration company.
The 56-year-old actor represents Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who writes and participates with long-standing comedian Greg Hemphilll.
The pair announced that the ninth season, soon to begin, will be the last of the series, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was planning to get involved in the "flowering business of the Glasgow restoration".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a land free of coastline, hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a ship base covered with rope in La Paz.
Public buildings feature a blue-sea flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for Amazonas host the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia, landless country, there is still a memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at the highest point in decades, since Bolivia awaits an International Court of Justice ruling on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
" Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive perspective on the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will witness the sentence of the TIJ on giant screens scattered across the country, hoping that the Hague court will act in favour of their country's complaint, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday's sentence.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," were the President's votes last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will act in favour of Bolivia, and that it would not change even otherwise.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the sentence of the TIJ be delivered only six months after the hearing of the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have harmed her.
"The question of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined some Chilean residual goodwill, suggested.
At a future time, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
Next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a possibility of "put an end to 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
" Bolivia will never dispense with its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmament without the country trusting in the USA
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho stated that his nation will never dispense with its nuclear weapons if it does not trust Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises they made during a Singapore summit among the leaders of rival countries.
His comments arise when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy in impasse, more than three months after the Singapore Summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said that it is an "impossible dream" to consider that the US' continued sanctions and objection to a statement that puts an end to the Korean war will ever lead the North to kneel.
Washington is afraid to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking significant first steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang really intends to reduce an arsenal that the country probably views as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang in the month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a shop near you
If you want to extend your collection of hats or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don't need to look for it anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of extravagant and oversized hats on the walkway for their 2019 spring-summer collections, which left the style set startled in Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very little practical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to pass it on.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a wide abba similar to a penalty that flooded the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included scratched beads of jewelry, a hat of speller and even a pineapple, although they were not designed to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks... even in carnival time.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with high seams.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tube and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice-cream cone.
And if you want to continue this huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Stylish observers predict that these huge hats are on their way to a shop near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent on the path of the "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm tab that has been used by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very little practical hat that spread through social networks sent another great creation for the passers-by: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the model in swimsuit that carried it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, decorated with stripes of rafia and with a white leather handle, was the most outstanding piece of the 2019 spring-summer La Riviera collection of Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I am waiting to see large hats and beach bags coming to the shops for the next summer. Since the designer had so much impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, with this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students scattered throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools intend to prepare their students for further education and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after theme in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If we speak to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter his heart."
This quote reminds us well that we cannot only rely on English when we want to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of recent exams this year, we verify that the languages are at the top of the tables, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of the students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum classification of A.
These data, collected in 74 schools under SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained the maximum rating of A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are favoring foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now viewed in the same way as STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and not only.
An investigation by the UK Employment and Competence Commission in 2014 concluded that, among the reasons for the difficulty of employers in filling vacancies, 17% concerned the lack of language skills.
Therefore, learning other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities to demand language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically place a multilingual person in front of competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, the French is the only language spoken by a two-digit ratio, 15%.
So investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
The domain of several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children better opportunities to find employment with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK for the 2020 horizon, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in independent schools, supported by specialized teaching staff in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills necessary for success, whatever future reserves them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance to the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence for young Scottish people.
We have to do this right.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron starts at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is over for the fans who want to see LeBron James start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, trainer of the Lakers, announced that James will participate in the opening game of Sunday's pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes will you play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers' journalist Mike Trudell posted a tweet stating that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for the schedule of six Lakers games in the pre-season.
"I don't need pre-time games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Time and channel of Trump's comitio in Western Virginia
President Donald Trump starts a campaign round tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five scheduled meetings for next week, which include stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of conformation waiting for your chosen for the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to strengthen support for the interim elections to be held soon, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's summit in Western Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m., Eastern Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's summit in Western Virginia online below in a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably address this week's hearings to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, who became tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The vote of confirmation provided for in the Senate will remain on hold for a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main objective of this stream of elections is to help Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, to gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign leaders stated that these five meetings next week intend to "give energy to volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans try to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives", says Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so fundamental to the president's agenda that he will visit as many states as possible, as we get closer to the turmoil of the campaign season," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign that he renounced to be quoted, Reuters told.
Marked for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening logo rally can attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get media coverage from the Pittsburgh area", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time in this month Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Western Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, at a disadvantage in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to give him an aid in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team demonstrates that it has the strength to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, the forsomes from Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing of the impulse is a totally invented sport concept, but it is one in which players truly believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would you say the impulse is coming now?
"They have a six-point advantage and now there are four, so we're looking at it as a little impetuous, I'd say," said Jordan Spieth while he was out of the field at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, in advantage with four points ahead and twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth states, still have some spare energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each of them achieved three points in four.
Spieth has been deadly from tea to green and is leading by example.
Those guttural shouts of celebration became higher as the round continued, with a crucial putt that made fourth match an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt who won the match in the 15th produced a similar scream, that guy who shows that he still believes that the American team continues in the competition.
"It is only necessary to concentrate and worry about our own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left to each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of Ryder Cup.
The European pair, improbable but adorable, is four out of four and it cannot go wrong.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on Friday morning's nine back.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, it consolidates the idea that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a European victory potential at the sunset in Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the speech on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero this morning, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the Nine Front put the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they were never about to leave.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely because of the interactions between partners, the advice they give or not and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better on the team so far and has gained a significant advantage in the final day. However, this forsomes session has also shown that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted it.
Europe with 10-6 leadership on Ryder Cup's last day
Europe will enter the last day of Ryder Cup with an advantage spread after leaving the fourballs and forsomes of the Saturday matches with a leader of 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the cargo with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulties reaching the four-point ranking in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, struggling to keep the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a failed American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series by 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance to forsomes with two winning matches, but failed to shorten the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points on Sunday's 12th singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points followed by him and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend they are only the only duet to win four points in his four opening matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they proudly consolidated the advantage, defeating a powerless Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who crawled during two matches on Saturday, revealed occasional genius accesses, but has already lost 19 of the games he fought in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third ranked in the world ranking.
However, on this pleasant day with a light breeze to the southwest of Paris, Europe has not always brought the best.
Jordan Spieth, winner for three times of the main men's tournaments, and Justin Thomas defined the reference for Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet won a brave 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain, and later returned to win Poulter and Rory McIllroy for 4&3 in foursomes, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup a team reversed a four-point disadvantage before the singles, although Furyk's team, holding the title, only needs to tie to keep the trophy.
After two days in the second position, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "don't think" of a unilateral disarmament without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was aggravating mistrust over the United States and that there was no way for the country to unilaterally dispense with its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear testing centre and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there will be no way to proceed to our disarmament first."
Although Ri has recycled well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, within which North Korea would be rewarded as he took gradual steps, his statements appear to be significant as they do not outright reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast to Pyongyang's previous positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever held between a US President in exercise and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump offered security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States claims that Pyongyang has first to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the appeals to soften the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "unnuclearization first" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive way, opposing the "declaration of the end of the war"," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of sanctions is aggravating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred by the US leader in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the interested party on this issue were South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse".
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was drastically different from that of last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that directing the rockets of North Korea towards the U.S. territory was inevitable after "Mr. President Mau" Trump called Kim the "man of rockets" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, filled Kim with praise for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much was still to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until North Korea's denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a calendar for that, stating that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable".
The Security Council unanimously reinforced the sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006 in an attempt to strangle the financing of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then declared that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, although then North Korea denounced him for "making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile installation and also a nuclear complex if the United States "takes appropriate measures".
Pompeo said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they sought were the security guarantees assumed by Trump in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses that teach them to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the machis culture of studying in "directes" impregnated with caffeine.
One teacher concluded that students from this university at the top of the world ranking often did not have the slightest idea about the most basic concepts about the care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believes he is the first of his kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course arose after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?"
The young woman said that no one had ever mentioned to her the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said that the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, shoes and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to pick up from the bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know you're not going to change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, just as we all have the right to know the health effects of the option to smoke," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "directing" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
To ensure that we sleep enough and with quality should be a "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid getting fat, because the deprivation of sleep puts the brain in a way of hunger, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students apply an alarm to go to bed, as well as to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can deregulate the circadian rhythm and lead to problems in falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal overthrows Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another access to sadness out of the house when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disarray team a 1-0 defeat at Livingston Stadium.
The team of Hemox sought to record his first victory on his way since the 1-0 win in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team finally inflicted the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the unbridled Hearts, leader of the first Scottish division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and the Rangers collective, uninspired, never seemed to be equal.
With Rangers now going down to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third, and just behind Hibernian by the difference of appetite.
And there may be even more problems for Rangers after the Prosecutor of the Calum Spence line has received treatment of a head injury caused by an apparently thrown object of the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that passed over the Ayr in the final half of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, used the same eleven of Livingston who stole a point from Hearts last week, and would have been delighted with the way his well-soldied team suffocated the opponents in each game.
Rangers may have mastered the possession of a ball, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have dialed at two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's beacon, but the average wasted his great opportunity outside.
A long kick-free Keaghan Jacobs met Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow managed only to finish off towards the second beam.
Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have been granted a great penalty to the quarter hour with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson refused Colombian appeal.
The Rangers achieved only two milestones in the first part, but the old networkguard of the Ambox Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head end and the weak finish of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's goal at the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected from the development of the game, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, the more it is not because of its tenacity.
Again, Rangers couldn't deal with a long-stop Jacobs ball game.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who remained calm when he chose Menga for a simple completion.
Gerrard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had immediate impact when the advanced side moved to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from her line to make the lock.
However, Livingston has continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long pass behind long pass.
Holt's team may have increased its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor held on well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a great penalty when he got angry in Jacobs, but Thomson ignored the request once again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Almanac "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, it is now 136 years old and continues to CONTAR ...The future physical Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A fundamental piece of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals as a uranium.
When we put these earphones, we can even hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity on minerals."
Evans: "Look, it's really cracking right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention he gave the name still persists.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its modification in the laboratory
These cells, which can "see" a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a series of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her cancer in the ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their modification in the laboratory to "see" a protein common to many cancers, designated HER2. These cells are then injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer", including those of breast, ovary, lungs and also colorectals, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teaching them to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a Trump support diatribe by wearing an MAGA hat after its appearance on the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West went to the studio at Saturday Night Live after an inconsistent performance in which he praised the president of the United States, Donald Trump, claiming that he would be running for the presidential elections in 2020.
After executing his song of the night, named Ghost Town, in which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he began a fight against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white guy and he tells me, "How can you like Trump? He's racist!"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL started with a satire with Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star trotted from Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been transmitted, the scene of West's bravery was published on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to get rid of West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a lot of time behind the scenes because of the hat.
"They intimidate me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
They've intimidated me!
And then tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see marginalization?", saying, "I would put on my superman coat, because that means no one tells me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try your love."
His comments provoked public vats and SNL participants appeared to be embarrassed, reported Variety, having someone from the program told the newspaper: "The whole studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of song I Love it disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received a demonstration of support from the director of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the tweet: "One of our most courageous spirits: TURBA'S REQUIREMENTS".
However, the interviewer Karen Hunter published a tweet saying that West was simply "to be what it is, and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (buying your music or supporting your "art") that I believe is welcoming and propagating harmful ideologies for the community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that it was now "the being previously known by Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg has already used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing music legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Accusation of attempted murder after stabling in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the eastern Belfast area on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhacklove, said the police.
The defendant is expected to be presented to the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the public ministry.
Throne War Star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a farmer as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO, the Throne War.
However, the actor, at 31 years of age, attacked the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that such roles on the screen make boys often feel that they have to be hard to be respected.
In a conversation with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague at the Rose Leslie Throne Wars, also at 31 years of age, admitted that he has a "very strong position" regarding the approach to the problem.
"I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they're growing up in terms of the problem we've witnessed now?"
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he went on, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel that they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big issues of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for young people."
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter into any prequelas or sequels of the Throne War when the series ended next summer, stating that for him the "war camps and horses" were over.
From November, Kit will participate in a True West re-ed by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Throne War.
"I met my wife in this series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from here on," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series awarded to Emmys.
The couple gave the knot in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% leap in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
Some 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual relations, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that, due to conservative values in the country, 70 to 90% of men who had sexual relations with other men end up marrying women.
Many transmissions of diseases derive from inappropriate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking information about Republican senators by one of her collaborators and attacks "dangerous liars" and "conspiracy theories"
US Congressman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the allegations that a member of your team would have published personal information from three members of the US Senate on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat declared that the accusations were being promoted by opinion leaders and "ultra-right" sites.
"True lies, lies and more contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes the residences of the households and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on allegations of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters Office and published data from a Waters staff member, reported The Hill.
"This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility in this leak of information.
This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including those of the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denier is choleric," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that she does not have the temper to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something that is not his responsibility, he cannot get angry.
You can't have a challenging posture.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
It must reveal calmness and serenity."
Fleischer appeared to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing to be too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will contest the Waters place in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," you read on your tweet.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted "the competent authorities" to these fraudulent allegations.
"We ensure that the guilty will be revealed," he continued, "and will be legally held responsible for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous for all and any members of my staff."
Johnny's criticism English Back to Attack - weak parody of spying film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashion to look for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British flavor, and this seems to actually apply to the new edition in the series of comedy films and action Johnny English, initiated in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Johnny English Return".
Is the ironic self-satistry on the subject of being so bad the new opportunity to export to the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes flogged and an excessively elastic expression obtained his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name signaling, more than anything, that it is a comprehensive comic creation for non-anglophone cinemaphiles.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a soft glamour, has a bit of Cloiseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed with a single note to the theme of the movie "Glory Moments" at the 2012 London Olympic opening ceremony.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international mysterious traveler and man whose role Atkinson played in the TV commercials for Barclaycard, which left chaos in his trail.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene in which Johnny English approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor, with the rotor's shovels making a short noise of rail against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is obvious, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that the editions of "serious" films such as the 007 and the Impossible Mission now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We have the idea that humor is directed at children and not adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English's bizarre adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie numbers in Bean's character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in a serious situation.
A computer pirate infiltrated the British supersecret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to dismay the service agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who incarnates a pompous and conflicting figure, already suffering a total gap of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives his best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give much material for large flights.
Your Secret Service advisors inform you that once all the agents in the asset have been compromised, you will have to get someone out of the reform.
And this person is the unfortunate Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a chic school, but teaching non-official lessons on how to be an infiltrated spy: here are some interesting numbers, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "Rock School".
English is taken quickly to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and join again to his suffering auxiliary Bough, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a submarine commander, an elusive character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the catastrophe in His Majesty's Secret Service are back to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, a role played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being dangerously bewitched by the charismatic billionaire of technologies that claim to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd acts taken away: disguised as table employees, lit up a prominent French restaurant, create the confusion penetrating as clandestines in the luxurious yacht of Volta, and English triggers pure anarchy how much he tries to use a virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops have certainly been created in view of this last sequence, but for the most sympathetic and tempestuous, the set has enough TV for children.
The result is quite medium.
And as in Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help wondering: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
Workers deny that they are generating a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day working week, but with five paid days.
Reports suggest that the party wants the bosses to pass on the savings with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers, granting them an additional day of strike.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping the orderly.
Sources state that the idea would "adjust" to the party's economic programme, which reorients the country to the benefit of workers.
The shift to a four-day work week obtained the favorable opinion of the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party leader said to The Sunday Times: "We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration adapted to the party's approach to the rebalancing of the economy for the worker, as well as the party's overall strategy for the industrial sector."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is not favored at this time by the entire Labour Party.
A party spokesperson said: "The four-day workweek is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it."
The shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist economy revolution.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain power from the hands of "directors without face" and " speculators" of basic service companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the total share of current shareholders of water companies, since the Labour Party may make "deductions" on the basis of the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell has also confirmed plans to place workers in company management boards and create Inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, which may pay dividends that can amount to 500 pounds annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the "60 Minutes" if FBI investigation Kavanaugh can do them or not change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, raising questions as to whether the findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, the correspondent for "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy's been more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the audience, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this allegation came up, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolved, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems unmovable.
"I am determined as to Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be necessary," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a vigorous lie," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I see nothing new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the city of New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive list of stars that will act on an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host tens of thousands of people in the Great Central Park turf, not only to witness the actions of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the true objective of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a defense group that hopes to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, a telephone call or any other significant ways that contribute to increasing awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or this is just another case of "clickactivism" - do we think it makes any difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen states that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who have exerted pressure to achieve a number of different objectives.
These actions, according to the organization, contributed to the announcement by world leaders of commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, with at least $10 billion in respect of the same being already disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people scattered around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom bringing together investors and implementers committed to "help children achieve their full potential", which promised to give 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end undernutrition in the country. This after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like all of us, we can make social injustice of undernutrition a footnote to History," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group further stated that, after more than 5000 pressure actions on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions on the website, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answers: "It was a long and tortuous way - sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the great civil and anti-apartheid rights movements that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will be performing this year's event in New York, presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
USA can use the Navy as a "block" to put an obstacle to Russia's energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington may resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, revealed US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, in particular where the legitimate government's invitation comes from, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to intermediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And, according to the ruler, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has the capacity, with its navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to block to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed participants in an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In his speech, he continued to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stating that they are effectively the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, leverage and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "magic of a single trick" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements arise at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, instead of Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, the authorities of the Trump administration, including the president himself, try to persuade Germany to abandon the "indecent" North Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the Nord Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, aims to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated for economic reasons, as it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russia's minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position motivated a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "analyze deeply" the possibility of applying for the presidency in 2020, said the Massachusetts Senator
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that she will "analyze deeply" the possibility of applying for the presidency following the mid-term elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider applying.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the maximum responsible," said The Hill.
"After November 6, I will look deeply at the possibility of applying for the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying that "he was taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been a harsh vocal critic of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey carried out on Thursday revealed that most of Warren's constituents themselves are not of the opinion that she should apply for the presidency in 2020.
59% of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts stated that the senator should not apply, according to the poll of the Political Research Center of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
32% support your application.
The survey showed superior support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other prominent names of the Democratic Party discussed in relation to a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions the post-traumatic stress of Track Palin at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence
"What my own son is going through, what's going on after he's back, I can identify with the other families who feel the branches of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers are actually coming back with," he told the audience of a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "return a little bit different, they return hardened, they ask again if there is such respect for what their comrades soldiers and aviators, and all the other members of the armed forces, gave the country".
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence over a woman and possession of a weapon while alcoholized, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district sent a statement amicus curiae (Friends of the Court) on Friday in Washington, in support of an asylum seeker who is contesting this policy, referred to NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. Sessions process that the American Civil Liberties Union brought against politics in August was not revealed.
The person said that his partner "and his children, members of a violent gang," abused her, but the US authorities rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
Public ministries that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, as nations that face widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision of the Council of Immigrant Resources that allowed immigrants without documents escaping domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General Karl Racine stated, in a statement on Friday, that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates that principle", reads the statement amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued in this statement that the police ban on the entry of immigrants negatively affects the US economy, stating that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "availability of the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
" asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion," said Sessions in its political announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the number of dead doubles in a counter-clock to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, 35 years old, the mother of a male febrile baby, by comforting him in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water."
Residents were sighted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find between their watery belongings.
There were hundreds of wounded and the hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured the ribs and shoulder, lay outside Palu Army Hospital, where the patients were treated abroad due to the strong replicas they continued.
His eyes were in tears as he reported what he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I got stuck in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid supplement at Des Moines Register, the most significant newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 election to Congress, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked the beginning of what the American authorities, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in the growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently blocking an ever-increasing trade war that saw both sides apply tariff waves on the other's imports.
China's retaliation rates in the early stages of the commercial war were designed to affect exporters in states that support the Trump Republican Party, say Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hurt workers, farmers and American companies.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion paper at Des Moines Register on Sunday, "it is now setting its foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertising ads in our free press."
"With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the loving American tradition of freedom of expression and of the press publishing an announcement paid at Des Moines Register," Branstad said.
"On the other hand, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a real reflection of the disparity of views that the Chinese may have of the worrying economic trajectory of their country, because the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
Moreover, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which.
Republicans alienate female voters before mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warn analysts
At a time when many important Republicans support and defend the nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that this may provoke a negative reaction, particularly from women, during the interim elections to be held soon.
The emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they want to move forward to a vote.
These things have no backlog," said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher stated that he doubts that the last-minute pressure of Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona Republican) to conduct an FBI investigation is sufficient to appease the rebels.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November is at the door!" when they protested in the Senate court, as the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee chose to advance with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat all the records," said Stu Rothenberg, political analyst without partisan affiliation.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among undecided voters in the suburban areas and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans moved forward with confirmation.
"This became a scam for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his seat as a judge. It's also about the way the Republicans dealt with it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities, a group that helps to elect democrats, to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41% of respondents believed absolute or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed absolute or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% claimed that they considered Kavanaugh to have probably or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI initiated an investigation into Ford's allegations, as well as another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford swore under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually molested her as an alcoholic when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the nominee for the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs when the two were participating in a party during the period when they were both studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web aims to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's open source platform.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jolly stated that the underlying intention of Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "on-line personal data storage", or POD.
This can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a single browser and simultaneously.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is solely for the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal ability through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work in the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology creators scattered around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about the introduction or not of a total change in which all of their business models are turned from one day to the next.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a publication on the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when it created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: tribute to the clergy decorated with Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergyman of the Church of England to receive Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter was honored in his birthplace 100 years ago.
Lieutenant Coronel Reverend Bernard Vann was decorated on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honour.
His two grandsons closed a commemorative plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brightly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Coronel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable weapons and machine guns".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage," led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and killing three soldiers of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's acts were "something I know I would never manage to match, but also a lesson in humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the stop, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was "very honored to participate in the stop" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people."
Fans of mixed martial arts all night to see Bellator 206 attend instead to Porca Peppa
Imagine this: you get up all night to see the Bellator 206, full of stars and, in the end, is prevented from seeing the main event.
The San José series included 13 combats, with six of the main group, and was being displayed live during the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the spectators in the UK were amazed when the coverage changed to Porca Peppa.
Some did not get impressed after they had been up early in the morning especially for combat.
A fan on Twitter described the change to cartoons for children as "a kind of joke of bad taste".
"The government regulations say that content is not suitable for six in the morning, so they had to change to another programming," said Dave Schwartz, administrator with the marketing and communications hairdresser, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa pig," yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that it would correct the transmission schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem," Coker said.
"But it's six Sunday morning there and we won't be able to resolve it until our Sunday time, which is Monday in British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that when programming changed, there were many exchanged messages and none very nice.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do, and we have tried to exceed the expectations of fans and overstated.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" about her sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley said that he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that he was motivated to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't notice until he entered high school that "not all are like me."
In an interview with the first Desert Island Discs from Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he stated that he expressed favor for the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympic Games.
The regular long-term presenter of the program, Kirsty Young, took off several months due to illness.
Appearing as a pair in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt " inferior" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
In his words, "to this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that gave me the power and the strength to achieve success".
His goal was to prove that he was "someone," he said, not to let everyone down when they discovered his sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he felt happy that he could live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The world trichamp said that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "I was surprised."
Daley married last year with Oscar's winner, 20 years older, although he claimed that the age difference was never a problem.
"When we pass by when we're so young" - his first participation in the Olympics was at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through similar heights and basses.
The couple had a son last year in June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all it mattered was "to win a gold medal," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
Your son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets to London games in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you're not gonna be around to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding him not hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of the whole life: diving in front of a multitude of compatriots in the Olympics... there was no better feeling," he said.
All this was also the inspiration of his first choice of song - Proud, by Heather Small - with which he had identified himself during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs passes on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British summer time.
Mickelson down in shape at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will reach a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th match at a Ryder Cup, but he will have to recover his way to prevent the mark from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing at the biennial event for the 12th time, a record of participations, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk at the fourballs and forsomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as so often has been in the U.S. teams, the five-time winner of the main male championships divided the day between the role of supporter and the work in their game in the field, hoping to correct what afflicts him.
Having never hit the most straight ones even at the height of their career, the 48-year-old player is not the ideal for the Le Golf National field, where the long rough usually punishes the erring ones.
And if the field itself was not intimidating enough, Mickelson, on Sunday's ninth match, will face the precise champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who made team with beginners Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four matches for them played this week.
If Americans, with a four-point disadvantage starting the 12 single matches, record a good start, Mickelson's departure can prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap in the back, put his arm around me and said I'd be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a respected champion who has given these teams a lot in the past, and this week too.
I probably hadn't seen him play two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we'd have to go on.
He wants to be in the game like everyone else."
Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record on Sunday of the largest number of matches played at the Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never matched the successes of your individual curriculum.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
"He's sarcastic, funny and spiritual, he likes to play with people and he's an excellent person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players had fun getting in with him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage can disappear in an apex
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his leadership on entering the last day of singles in Ryder Cup can easily become an accidental walk.
The Danish had its debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seven Ballesteros maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the nose with the narrowest of the margins, winning by 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"We always tried to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little by little," said Bjorn, in the image, after having attended the victory of the Tour 2018 for 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, to lead for 10-5 in the Le Golf National.
So, history has shown me and everyone on this team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow, give your best.
Go and do it all right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus should remain.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of who is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enchanted with the performance of their players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of it myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters are individual performance and this involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we're there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the maximum.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they're leaving the partner and he has to go and give himself the best."
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek that his players have a better performance individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
Furyk himself has already been on both sides of these big rounds on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before ending up losing when Europe pulled the "Miragre in Medina" from the card.
"I remember all the words," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important departures tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medina.
When this impulse turns to one side, the pressure is very great in these parts of the environment.
We have organized our effective accordingly and ordered the players in the way we feel, you know, that we will try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counterattack, faces Rory McIllroy in the main game, being Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players for this order because I believe it covers the entire route," Bjorn said about their choices for singles.
New German warship once again postponed
The most recent frigate of the German Navy should have entered service in 2014 to replace warships of the Cold War time. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to failures and an exponential growth cost, according to local media.
The entrance to the service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit which quoted a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the disturbing post-delivery problems have undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four boats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Navy had ordered in 2007 will serve to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, in addition to a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ships missiles, as well as some furtive technologies such as the reduction of radar signatures, infrared and acoustics.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenances, which would allow the most recent frigates to be sent to missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continuing delays have led to the fact that with the state-of-the-art warships, considered as a way for Germany to design power beyond borders, they will already be outdated when they come into service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy refused to put it on duty, having returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cite a series of crucial hardware and software defects that would make the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the quota needed in the oldest frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the vessel is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the marine ability to install additional features in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" has twice the weight of similar class ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros, an increase compared to the 2.2 billion originally budgeted.
The problems experienced by the most recent frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German parliamentary defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used."
The politician said that the problem grew exponentially over time, as older ships were put out of service without the existence of ships to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were able to join the Navy.
National Trust spies the secret life of bats
New investigations are being carried out on a property in Scottish Highlands with the aim of revealing the way bats use the landscape to search for food.
It is expected that the results will shed some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and fruit, as well as long ear chestnuts and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations scattered by the property to follow the bat activities along the station.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and by volunteers with portable detectors.
The expert analysis of all recordings will evaluate the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed image of its territorial-scale behaviors.
Rob Dewar, an advisor for the conservation of the nature of the NTS, expects the results to reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
The bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development work that affects the dormitories and make habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightnings are also a threat, together with the kill-mouse papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to the attacks of domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given your night hunting habits, your ears are more useful than your eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
They use a sophisticated echo tracking technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct studies, dormitory inspections and sometimes rescues.
He also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, in the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The property director, David Thompson, says that the same is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Three we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many old trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still much about the bats that we do not know, so the work that we do here and in the other properties will help us to know more about what they need to bloom."
It was emphasized by him the importance of verifying whether there are bats before carrying out maintenance on the properties, because the unintentional destruction of only a maternity dormitory can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
The bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, besiege them, disturb them or destroy their dorms.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish leader of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate in helping.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are getting revenge."
Ronaldo denies charges of rape when his lawyers prepare to prosecute German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
Your lawyers are preparing to process the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The advanced Portuguese and Juventus selection was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that you will then pay $375 000 for the alleged victim to remain silent about the accident, read on Friday's Der Spiegel.
Speaking in a video live on Instagram to its 142 million followers hours after the disclosure of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, characterized the stories as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the winner of five Gold Balls to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel on the allegations, which have characterized them as "an inadmissible report of suspicions in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz stated that the player would claim compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident will have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Majorga will allegedly have gone to the player's room, where the player will have violated her annually, according to the documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and told him it was "99%" "a good guy", damaged by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that was consensual.
Majorga also claims that she addressed the police and had photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she would later have agreed to enter into an out-of-court agreement because she felt "terrorized by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now claims that she intends to cancel the agreement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, outside Manchester United, at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer moved to the Italian giant Juve in a 100 million euro business.
Brexit: United Kingdom "would forever repent" of losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent forever" if it lost its status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said the Secretary for Greg Clark Enterprises.
Clark also mentioned that Toyota in the UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of delays on the borders in the case of a Brexit without agreement could lead to job loss.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My perspective is that, if Britain leaves the EU disorderly at the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom expressed concerns about the exit of the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is managed on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts reaching every 37 minutes, from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU, for cars manufactured by order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock in its Derbyshire factory, said the company, so the production would have to stop.
Clark said that Theresa May's "Checks Plan" for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We have to have an agreement, and we want to have the best agreement to allow, as I said, not only the current success, but also the use by us of this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The evidences not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers point out that we absolutely need to be able to proceed with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Although it was unable to provide an estimate of the stop time, Toyota said that, in the long run, the increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and could, sooner or later, lead to job loss.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates the United Union in this place, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never return.
A government spokesperson said that "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "adjourned another week" given that there is still no understanding as to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, referred to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of the legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, links between Trump's advisors and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump may be preparing the Deputy Attorney General's dismissal, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, has been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording talks with Trump and the possibility of filing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, with information that he would be about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said "I'd rather not say goodbye" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which they witnessed Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press advisor Sarah Sanders participated in Fox News Sunday.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been marked, may be this week but may also be postponed another week in view of everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would not agree with this statement: Sanders has not organised a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said that: "I would not disagree with the fact that they like the protagonist."
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President does more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, adding, without adding evidence: "We analyze these numbers."
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has an opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is infinitely better than talking to me.
We have tried to do this often and they have seen that we have done it in the last few weeks, and the fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences when receiving foreign representatives.
The press conferences on the ground are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing casually and sometimes bizarre to the journalists present.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service about Brexit's fears
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and ask them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after leaving the United Kingdom of the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to pay for applications for residence status of EU citizens working in the decentralized public services of the country.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal were continued, and decisions were expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at the moment how much I value the contribution of each official, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and from other backgrounds have valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to continue here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after having suffered head injuries
The defense of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after having suffered head injuries in the defeat on Saturday for 31-27 in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tigers.
Coach of the Tennessee team, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
"He approached the side line and practically fainted," Reed said.
The technical team and medical staff put Abercrombie oxygen in the side line before laying it in a maca and transporting it to a more in-depth evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of WSMV from Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/gravity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended the studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five plaques on Saturday before leaving the game, which raises his total season to 18 plates.
A higher stamp tax will be charged to foreign buyers when they acquire property in the United Kingdom
The Conservative Party has announced plans to collect a higher stamp tax on foreign buyers who acquire properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in the aid to the homeless
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate
The rise in stamp tax will affect buyers who are not taxed in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp tax will be charged to foreign buyers who acquire properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in homeless aid, today will announce Theresa May.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises to make accommodation more accessible and tax higher incomes.
The rise in the stamp tax will affect people and businesses who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to boost the government's campaign to offer shelterless shelters.
The surcharge - added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second housing and rental purchases - may rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the measure will allow up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new constructions in London are acquired by non-residents in the United Kingdom, increasing prices and making it difficult for buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy arises weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a stamp tax cut to help young people acquire their first home.
It accused the large construction companies of maintaining the prices of the high properties by landing land they do not use, demanding that Mrs. May abandon the quotas on the housing accessible to solve the "failure of housing" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a number of calls for housing reform proposals, including income controls and the end of "no justification" evictions.
It also wants to assign extended powers to municipalities for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I stated that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for every new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not true that it is as easy to buy homes for people living outside the United Kingdom and for foreign companies as for British workers living in the United Kingdom.
For too many people the dream of owning your home has become too distant and the shame of those who sleep in relent remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to direct Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said that his "late ambition" is to become a picker for Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scotch has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the Northeast Club, currently ranked third in the First League, to three points of leadership.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on his return to the First Scottish Division last time.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I just got an internationalization B," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
"I grew up to see Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if you succeed in managing clubs."
Ross' predecessors as a Sunderland coach include Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says that he was not afraid to succeed in such a great club after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, at the moment success is summed up to "can I take the club back to the Premier League?"
Considering the club's structure and facilities, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to take the club back, but I'll only consider that I was successful here when I reach that goal."
Ross' career as a coach is only three years old, after a period as a deputy coach of Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of depromotion to the title of champion at the following time.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crusade," he recalls.
"I've always seen more in the role of coach than in the role of player.
Seems strange because it went well, I earned my life as a player, and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and pressure from the office, but I feel really good as a coach.
I have always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than ever I have felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a painting is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave filled British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurants chains.
The restoration groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but the occupation of restaurants decreased 4.8%, showing the statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consultant, who compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of England's good time and career in the World Football Championship, longer than expected, made the June standard, in which the pubs recorded a 2.8% increase in sales, if repeated in July, but the restaurants knew a retreat.
The decline of 1.8% recorded in the restoration sales in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the beverage-based business had far the best performance, with a homologous growth that more than compensated for the descent of restaurants.
Pubs with the business based on meals also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the restoration operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars managed directly, the sales of drinks rose 6.6% over the month, with meals receding 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst for the RSM recreation and restoration sectors, said: "These results prolong the trend we have experienced since the end of April.
The meteorology and the impact of the great social and sports events continue to be the main factors influencing the sales of the food market outside the home.
It is no surprise that the restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual fall in sales of 4.8% is particularly damaging when added to the extension of the pressure of costs.
The long and hot summer could not reach worse times for operators with the business based on meals. Only time will tell if the mildest temperatures we know in August will provide the desired relief."
The growth of total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown of brand launch.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator of the sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes the performance data of 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds, being recognized as the benchmark of the sector.
One in every five children hidden from parents secret accounts in social networks
One in five children - some with only 11 years of age - has secret accounts in the social networks that hide parents and teachers, revealed a study
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a growth of the "false" pages on Instagram
The news aggravates fears about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children - some with only 11 years of age - create accounts on the social networks that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of "false" accounts on the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news aggravates fears about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "principal" harmless account to show their parents, with private accounts at the same time.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found that the teenager was encouraging others to "violate her".
The study, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of whom admitted to maintain private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers feel tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish Council of Atletism
Eilidh Doyle was elected Non-Executive Director of the Scottish Council of Atletism at the annual General Assembly of the Regulator.
Doyle is the most practicing medalist of Scottish athletics. President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout the Scottish, British and world community of athletics and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have a lot to gain with its presence in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be able to act like the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to really contribute to help guide sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-400-meter test at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, stopped being able to walk after a transient ischemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: "It's been a month since I suffered a stroke.
I stopped being able to walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I could recover and to what extent.
It has been a difficult job but it achieves a full recovery, I have learned to walk again and I have even done agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Milk pump announcement compares mothers to cows, dividing opinions online
A milk pump company divided opinions online with an ad comparing mothers who breastfeed cows in order.
To mark the launch of what is described as the "first silent portable pump of milk extraction", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic announcement inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom conferred by the new bomb to mothers who extract milk.
Four mothers dance in a hay-filled holiday to the sound of a song that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm ordering, but I don't have tail" and, "If you haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my breasts."
The saying goes, "Bomb, bomb, feed the babies, bomb, bomb, I'm ordering my girls."
However, the announcement published on the company's Facebook page generated controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it would ease the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Three decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born," wrote a spectator.

Another commented: "Incomprehensibly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to announce an extraction bomb for mothers who can stay with their babies?"
Someone also said, "An announcement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad, like a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarante".
"I think that's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but it makes all the sense.
This product is great," wrote one of the women.
Another commented: "It is a fun announcement addressed to mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or at work) and feel like cows.
It is not an advertisement to praise or judge the dairy sector."
At the end of the video the group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who extract milk from bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie bomb is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, take their babies and even leave home while extracting milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of "Mother", commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between women who extract milk and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while we presented ourselves in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible feeling of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was a slap.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two passed through the bridge to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children displaced discreetly for a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children reached a peak, although the monthly crossings of the border remained relatively unchanged, partly because the rhetoric and severe policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult for children to become parents.
Traditionally, most of the "standards" are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential standards and other adults who integrate their family members would have to register their fingerprints, and the data were shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs Immigration and Control Service, testified to the Congress that the service had dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service subsequently confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
"Almost 80% of the parents or members of their family members are illegal in the country, many of them foreign with criminal registration.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of the date of detention, instead of 60 days, the previous rule, according to the officials of the reception centres.
Many are present by videoconferencing, not in person, to defend their application for legal status before a judge of the immigration court.
Those considered to be ineligible for aid shall be promptly deported.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which may lead to access to violence or escape attempts, according to the staff of the reception centres and with reports produced by the system in recent months.
The advocates of immigrant rights say that these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as those of Tornillo, where the large size contributes to the ignorance of the signs of child disturbance.
They add that the transfer of children to the camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma with which many are already discussing.
Syria requires immediate withdrawal of the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also requested the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, despite the war in the country in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such".
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that has left millions displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "carry this sacred battle until we free all Syrian territories" from both the terrorist groups and "all and any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "abstaining irrational fears" that led the refugees to remain abroad.
"We ask the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone at the last major rebel bastion in Idlib created an opportunity to insist on political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement established "clear times" and expressed hope that military action aimed at the jiadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene shortly the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited "to the review of the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Because Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the challenge and scandals end their presidency in advance.
In the one that would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic end of an ever presidency"!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue from the spectators.
Since 2014, noble time audiences have more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in noble time, a rise to 1.7 million in four years, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show" led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million spectators on big news nights.
"This is a strong call for people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC program "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet chief who becomes President after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comedy veteran and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has another theory.
Remember once you called a cab in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him he was going to vote Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos have entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television programmes, stories from Washington can determine the future of legislation on abortion, the right to family reunion of immigrants and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury to which only the most privileged spectators can be given.
And yet, it is more than being an informed citizen when we are watching at the sixth hour a debate of experts on Bob Woodward's use of sources "with deep knowledge" in his book "Fear", the ostrich leather blouse of 15,000 dollars by Paul Manafort ("a piece of clothing full of insolence", as the Washington Post said) and the implications of the squabious descriptions of Stormy Daniels of... um... anatomy of President Trump.
For my part, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he has done looks like a reality show because he gives us something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's dynamic cast and the daily turns of the plot (antagonize with NFL, commend Kim Jong-Un).
We can't lose any episode or we'll stay back.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up at home, seeing MSNBC as he recorded CNN.
It did not crumble on television as Brett Kavanaugh prepared to testify before the Senate's Justice Committee, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right after all."

Significant external funding in mid-term elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th circle of Pennsylvania knows a flow of funding, thanks to a realignment of the electoral circles that left two headlines in the race in the same place.
The recent readjustment of Pittsburg suburban circles put in the race the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won her place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is running against another title, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old circles unconstitutionally favored the Republicans.
The 17th circle race sparked a tough struggle for funding the campaign between the financial arms of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangennial victory in the extremely contested extraordinary elections of March to the 18th electoral circle of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This place was occupied more than a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
USA considered penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, later retreating
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump Organization from the management.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call the leaders of US diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after the "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the spokesperson of the State Department, in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about US$ 140 million in aid in 2017, including for the control of drug trafficking, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high rates of unemployment and murder.
With the continuation of the internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, putting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now marked in mid-October, on a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesperson for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on the internal deliberations covered by anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study History
The next bomb to be dropped may be the report of the legal adviser Robert Mueller on Mr Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which currently has substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will be allegedly guiding his investigation to determine whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia to attack the elections.
If Congress changes its hands, Trump will face accountability on the part of that body, while preparing to re-present himself to voters and perhaps to be judged by his peers.
There are many possibilities and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the combat.
In 1938 some German officers were prepared to lay Hitler in a coup, since the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around points of inflection like this, in which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or blocked.
The Americans are currently facing several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Trump fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the President, speculating on his inability to perform the position.
Rosenstein says The Times' news is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court, despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump responsible?
If we take these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to light Sabbath candles at that table with the swastika.
With an inheritance of these, how could he not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Optimist Rangers before the game with the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive tie in Spain with the Villareal at the beginning of the month, will leave them in a good position to qualify in Group G of the League Europe.
A knee injury prevented medium Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the time up to the double-degree tie with the Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trampoline for higher flights.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We took the game with a positive mindset and we won a point.
Maybe we could have won near the end, but overall, the draw was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first part but we turned around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game, but with the support of the public, I am sure that we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
Last year was very hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the workouts are good.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past season and achieve success."
Women are losing sleep with fear of this savings-reform account
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted to take, few people spoke to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals questioned in the Nationalwide study mentioned talking to their spouses about the cost of continuing care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same subject.
"People want a family member to look after you, but they're not having that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You will not be able to prepare your family to provide care if you do not give them knowledge of their wishes in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial consultant: Your consultant may also help you find a way to pay these expenses.
Its options for funding continued care may include a long-term traditional insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary value to help cover such expenses or financing through its own savings, provided that it has those values available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Name a health care provider, choosing a person from their trust to supervise their health care and ensure that professionals respect their wishes if they are prevented from communicating with them.
Consider also the establishment of a procuratorship over its finances.
You should select someone you trust to make financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you are disabled.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent suffers from a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include that information in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only financial issues, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What's the medication?
Who'll take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan."
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air pressure when he returned home after one night in town.
The victim, at the 40-year-old home, was in the Oxford Grove area, in Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in the chest, in the abdomen and in the hand.
The agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries do not involve life-threatening and the police have requested witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities reported, and the number of deaths was expected to increase.
With the interrupted communications, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline, on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with an administrative status below that of a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it concentrates mostly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific seismic fire ring, being regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December a strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, originated a tsunami that reached 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes reached the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that fell on the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A earthquake of magnitude 7.6 reached the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died buried under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes reached the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for accusations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaskan governor and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, aged 29, resident in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested by suspicions of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is held in pre-trial detention centre in Mat-Su, under bail of $500, told KTUU.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously, innocent," he reported the station.
Palin faces charges for three class A crimes, which means he can be sentenced to a sentence of up to one year and fined at $250,000.
He was also accused of a class B crime, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
Your girlfriend accused him of squeezing her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran associations after associating the violent behavior of the child with post-traumatic stress resulting from his service in Iraq.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died following a earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude earthquake 7.5 originated a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electrical and communications networks were cut, expecting the number of dead to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit the Central Sulawesi region, north-east of the Indonesian capital Jacarta.
They circulate videos on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Ministry asks for rare capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York
The New York Public Prosecutor's Office calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to execute an attack in October, on a cycle on West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, crashing pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and inflicted "intentionally" serious injuries, according to the notification requesting the death penalty, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight charges of murder in the service of organized crime, usually used by the Public Prosecutor in cases of organized crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack demanded a "considerable planning and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed it as "atroz, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaev Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," reports the notification.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade now, New York's South Zone has not been calling for the death penalty for an indictment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the penalty was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953, when couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit spying acts in favour of the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court's documentation, Saipov, natural from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators to feel good about what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the accusation.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He declared himself innocent in respect of all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense lawyers, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for life imprisonment, without the possibility of liberation, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the defendants not to apply for the death penalty.
Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Congress of Conservatives.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should "feel pressure" on Euroscetics, while one of Theresa May's Members suggested that he should lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative colleague Peter Bone stated in the Birmingham demonstration that the United Kingdom "would have already left" if Farage was Minister of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to reconcile her deeply divided co-religionaries was underlined by the conservatives who defend the permanence, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has debated himself to maintain his plan of commitment, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of the attacks of Brexit supporters, defenders of residence and the EU.
Allies insist that she will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing the Eurocetics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "end the Plan".
Bone suggested that Farage should have been given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out already," he said.
The Member of Wellingborough added: "I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan".
Strengthening his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two World Wars to be subservients.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone refused the allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is totally defunct".
The conservative defender of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration, saying to the journalists: "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular in our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the street and to whom we owe our election.
Let Plane Chequers drop and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "Only the prime ministers who know how to keep promises keep their jobs".
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are ready to betray the decision out of the 2016 referendum.
"This became a question of trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them they're not gonna get away with it."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want them to press our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that has given us the victory in Brexit and which will not rest until we become an independent, proud United Kingdom and which governs itself."
Meanwhile, the defenders of the stay marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A crowd of activists took tracks with the message "Conservatives Against Brexit" after the launch of the group this weekend.
The representative of Labour in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with an application of the party at the opening of the Congress.
"It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for 'Canada more', for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he concluded.
Warren plans to "put seriously" the possible candidacy of the President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to "put the President's candidacy seriously" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is a candidate for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, co-mandator of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that you will be able to face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump's takeover.
One of the participants asked if he planned to apply for the Presidency.
Warren said it's time "for women to go to Washington to correct our government's problems and that includes a woman in the top place."
Detention in the context of the murder of Wayde Sims, of the LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the case of the murder of the basketball player of LSU Tigers, Wayde Sims, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
The police had released a shooting video on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the pictures.
Yes, 20-year-old, was shot near Southern University campus in the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims took a bullet in his head, after which he ended up dying," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the journalists on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted his presence on site, holding a gun, acknowledging that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without showing resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a 1.98 meter junior created in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and was held for 10 times in the past season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per game.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders in Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving the pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind by defending his position on the first two curves, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the boxes and made Hamilton have to face the end of the platoon traffic, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxes one time later and went after Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a rowing skirmish, after which Ferrari's pilot reluctantly left the internal part of the free track, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself on the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in the seventh place at the end of the first round on the day of his 21st anniversary.
He then led much of the race, exchanging too late tires, which would allow him to be fast at the end, aiming to overcome Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He just came to the boxes on the 44th turn but failed to improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to end in room.
"It's a hard day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman, letting me over it.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday due to his insistence that he would not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee, noting instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "more malicious and false".
"Look at the beautiful thing that's happening in the Senate in the last few days, see the anger, see how evil, malicious and false people are," Trump said.
"When we see the leaks and the releases and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did the escape start from you?
Do you remember her answer... did you divulge the document?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't start from me.'
Well, wait there.
The escape came from us... no, it wasn't us," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but denied that the escape had left his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I complied with her request."
But his disbelief did not convince the President, who commented during the Saturday evening meeting: "You know more, that was terrible body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges on his behalf.
"They are determined to regain power by resorting to all means.
We see evil, malice, it doesn't matter who can achieve, who has to step up to take power and control," said the President, according to the Mediate.
First Division: Dundee Stars Beat Belfast Giants by 5-3
Patrick Dwyer marked two greeds for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from the defeat on Friday in the game of the First Division against the Belfast Giants, winning the second hand by 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants got an initial advantage of two gourds with the endings of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied up for the home team before Dwyer put the Giants back in front.
François Bouchard tied to Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald's appetites guaranteed the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had achieved a turn on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee for 2-1.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, having the Giants won the three previous games.
The first goal of Dwyer arose at the fourth minute (3:35) following a assistance from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier increase the advantage four minutes later.
In a frenetic first period, Sullivan put the house team back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie the draw, at 15:16.
Dwyer assured that the Giants would arrive at the first interval in leadership, marking their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The team of the house was reorganized and Bouchard retraced with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen take Dundee to the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, guaranteeing victory by marking the fifth goal of the team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, receive Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape from earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has been hailed as a hero after dying to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people died and many remain missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to blow up the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues had fled to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan General refused to leave his post while the control tower was raging violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
It remained focused to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was then on the runway, was safely taken off.
He then jumped out of the control tower, in front of the eminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for the Indonesian Air Navigation Agency, Yohannes Siriat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian television channel ABC News.
We sent a Balykpapan helicopter to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"We were devastated by this news," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach the thousands, referring to the country's disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, as there are many bodies buried in the rubble that we have not yet been able to rescue," said the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and maintenance to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
There's no drinking water.
The minimarkets are being picked up everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces on site and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations.
Early this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that took over 550 people's lives.
Air Niugini reports now that there is a man missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a man missing after reporting that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued safely from the plane sinking.
In a statement, Air Niugini stated that from Saturday afternoon he was unable to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The area company claimed to be collaborating with hospitals, researchers and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further disclosure on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water by trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The official entities stated on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline argued that six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
It is not yet clear what caused the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in stating that the plane failed to reach the runway and loved the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was off track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was coming too low.
"It was the best thing that happened," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other people had managed to crawl with the water through the waist and get to the plane's emergency exits sinking.
He said that the flight attendants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working on a spring repair work nearby also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank to 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people died in accidents with registered PNG airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used his cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of 20-year-old Quintom Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several mobile phones that confirm that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and claimed he had not been in the city that day.
When the charge asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by claiming that he was in his van that night, Sanford answered that he was lying because the van was in Nashville."
Another incongruence in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
The cell phone records indicated that they only met a week ago.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted SMS messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He paid her back from her life," Hale said.
The defence should begin to submit its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would begin to be examined by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop conscious?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling your music with positive messages.
The High Breed group of Bristol states that hip hop has deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to return to these roots and return popularity to the conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent rebirth in the United Kingdom thanks to the intervention of other interpreters, such as Akala and Lowkey.
One more black?!
New York Love Processes Couple by Farewell via a "racist" SMS message
A New York's nurse is prosecuting a couple for discriminatory dismissal after they have mistakenly received a text message from the mother complaining that "there was one more black".
The couple denied the accusations of racism, claiming that the trial was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed some fear when she discovered that the new lover Giselle Maurice was black when she presented herself for her first day of work in 2016.
"I can't believe... but a black man," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when you noticed your outfit, a "pregnant" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice claiming the poor performance of the previous African American lover and who was waiting for a Filipino nurse.
Giselle Maurice was paid for his only day of work and sent to Uber's house.
Now, Giselle Maurice is processing the couple and applying for a redundancies of 350 USD/day for the six-month period for which she had been chosen without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't get unpunished," he said to the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying that firing Giselle was perfectly logical because they feared they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent him something I didn't really mean.
He's not racist.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco said at the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to someone who had been treated badly, even by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I can't believe it."
When he called the process "extortion," Plasco said that his wife had been a mother just two months ago and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to chase someone like that?
It's not very nice," the investment banker added.
As the legal proceedings proceed, the court of public opinion was quick to condemn the couple in social networks, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers might not identify with a talking bear
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented as follows: "It's hard to get into the skin of someone who first read it before it was published.
It's really fun to know this now, after Paddington's been so successful."
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a little bear to play writing the children's book, would not have had the book been rejected, and added that the 60-year-old anniversary of the publication had a bitter taste given his death last year.
About Paddington, who described as "a very important member of our family," said the father was very proud of the success he had achieved.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to the gabarolice," he said.
"But as Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we get proud even when it's not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the result of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to my phone.
Soon after landing, the daughter had been taken as an emergency to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nothing would call often to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of surviving," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medicines that the doctors had given him to keep the heart working were slowly giving up and leaving their system.
He had already died a while ago and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to contain myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning for her daughter's loss, boarded the plane along with other passengers outside the test for what was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"I always cried low-headedly.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a great compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women of mourning post cards on bridge to avoid suicide
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide fight to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivation messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, Sharon Davis' son, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Sharon Davis, 45 years old and resident in Lydney, said the son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
They all said I was lighting up the room."
However, he gave up work before he died because he had "died in the darkness".
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible impact."
Sharon Davis created the postcards "to let them know that there are people who are available to help and who can talk to, even if he's a friend.
Do not close in yourselves. You have to speak."
Kelly Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother-in-law died.
"I didn't say I was sad or depressed," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in your behavior.
On Christmas Day, there was a rag, when the kids opened the gifts, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "Destruct a family.
No one's indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake with the start of the FBI investigation
"I thought that when we had a similar approach to what I had asked - a time and scope research - we could become more united," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, saying that I feared that the committee would "fall down" in the face of an entrenched partisan impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is merely a temporary matter.
Intermediate elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their failed Supreme Court candidate.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met the woman Ashley, Bush's personal secretary at that time.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not certain that Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the vote of contempt and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea decreases during Kim's regime
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean deserters to North Korea has decreased since the rise to power of Kim Jong-un seven years ago.
When quoting data from the Ministry of Unified South Korea, Park Byung-seug indicated that 1127 desertions occurred last year compared to 2706 of 2011.
Park said that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers of people asked for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public statements.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of deserters in North Korea.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers that the deserters are illegal and non-refugees migrants, and it is common to repatriate them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that are at an impasse.
The talks took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general, to collaborate in the creation of an unnuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Ministers, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the U.S. for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the minority in the Chamber, said Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
So he made these comments in an interview given on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all sexual abuse bonds to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional openness, sometimes in a shrill and resolute voice, speaking of his family and high school years.
He also explicitly accused the Commission’s Democrats, calling for the allegations made against him of “grotesque and conspiracy killing” organized by liberals angry by Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
So he said to believe that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he has no conditions to serve in the Supreme Court because of his preconceived behavior against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
When asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's effective appointment and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you don't meet the conditions to be in the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the D.C. Circumcision Relation Court.
So he added that, as a Democrat, he was afraid of potential opinions from Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare), or the Roe vs Wade case, given the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh outlined questions about the possibility of revoking certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and hope that we will be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women need to know how to control emotions.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of rage overflowing, and it can't take off without crying.
"We wait when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's something strange, do I?"
A woman in an executive position in a company helped me a lot. She told me that she was crying when she got angry, but she had created a technique. When she was angry and started crying, she said to the person I was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And he kept going.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant," continued Mrs. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly, in an old job in an office dominated by men in which I cried of unspeakable anger, being held by the neck by an older woman - an unfriendly manager who terrorized me a little - and literally dragged to the stairs to hear her say
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're gonna be happy for having been able to affect you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democratic Congressman, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on board a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not apply herself to the presidents.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," he told me to laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who called the situation "The Snowwhite and the Seven Annans."
Given its late entry, the fundraising was less than desirable and he swore that he would only enter the race if he could earn $2 million.
A battle condemned to defeat.
He discovered that some of his supporters would only give him $250, although they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I have a right to a discount?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not go into a formal campaign, the emotions came to the top - gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and bring the message to the voters instead of the delegates, and anger against sexism - and tears arose.
"So far it seemed that she was depressed," recalled Patricia Schroeder, speaking of the media reaction.
"I would have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would they write on my epitaph now?
"She cried?"
How trade war between the U.S. and China can be beneficial for Beijing
The first rescue of the US-China trade war was shocking, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, in the perspective of the experts, the removal of the two countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the U.S.A., fired the first warning at the beginning of the year when taxing important Chinese imports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week was the stage of a significant worsening of the situation with the new rates to affect goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), charging in reality half of all goods sent by China to the U.S.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently raising the rates from 5 to 10 percent for US goods worth $60 billion.
China has committed itself to following the steps of the U.S. and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will waver in the near future.
Making Washington back would mean yielding to demands, but showing a public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its trumps, the pressures imposed by the US trade war can sustain China positively in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"In reality, the fact that an early political decision in Washington or Beijing can result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to the study of Asia at the Center for New American Security, a reflection group.
Minister for Foreign Affairs states that Syria is prepared for the return of refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for aid for the reconstruction of a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, stated that the conditions of the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that have left because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly receive aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from the countries that sponsored the revolt.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The Selection of Europe beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National around Paris, France.
The U.S. now accumulate six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time they won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.

The American star Phil Mickelson, who demonstrated serious difficulties during most of the tournament, shot the tee of departure for water in hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has shined in all his rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 for the worst-classed player in the selection of Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter in which he may have been his last participation in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the most award-winning European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"It's not my habit to cry, but I couldn't stop today.
It was a hard year.
I can't help thanking Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so glad we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I am happy that I was able to help," said an emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
Pass the word to your compatriot Jon Rham who defeated the American Gulf legend Tiger Woods, by 2&1 singular on Sunday.

Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record at Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 big titles won and only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finanu who had a high-calibre performance throughout the tournament, the remaining elements of the U.S. Selection were discussed to reach the fairway.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I pride myself on them. They fought.
This morning, we can put some fear into Europe.
We fought.
My congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All your 12 players were excellent.
We're going to reorganise ourselves and I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move on.
I like a lot of these 12 players and I'm proud to be your captain.
I have to take my hat off the other team.
They were better."
