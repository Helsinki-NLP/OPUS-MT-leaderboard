I can't hold my right hand.
I'm hungry.
Yoko refused to answer my question.
Tom was very different from his father.
Like a father, like a child.
Some of my friends speak English well.
Tom pointed to the floor.
Lately he's been a very good person.
He's from France.
Tom knew he heard something.
It is more precious than gold.
I willingly responded to him.
Learning about foreign culture was fun.
When did you start wearing a lens?
Tom wouldn't like that answer.
Oh, really?
I thought you were trying to contact us earlier.
Without fear, he refused to give up.
I'm trying to write about ethnic and minority religion.
I must have made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
The knife's too tight until it can't be used to cut meat, I finally use my pocket knife.
Behind his blind eyes.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom's forgotten.
Where have you been?
The traffic lights are used to set the traffic.
Don't let Tom see these photos.
This room gets a little sunlight.
He's drawing a picture.
I shouldn't have broken that red light.
Bring me a bucket of water.
I used to get out of my way.
It smells so bad.
Words are words.
There is no god but Allah, and He is the Messenger of Allah.
Just yesterday I found out.
You can buy it at the bookstore.
Let's get on the Intercity-Express train.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
My brother likes music.
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Want to go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I think I can come this afternoon.
"It's no use waiting for two hours." "Yes!
Tom was one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I just told Tom what Mary told me.
There's sugar, there's ants.
You'll never find your way home, through a narrow stone road.
Tom really wasn't at home when we came to visit him.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
That guy's driving a car.
Smell the birthday card that's coming.
Please read it one more time.
When can you do that?
I'm just kidding.
Tom's almost hit.
I'm going, too.
Love is never wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
The cost has already included payment for professional services to complete the survey.
You don't really want to learn logogram, do you?
Tom tried to persuade Mary to help him.
Two things are unrelated.
How can I not realize this?
What's this called?
I'm staying at home because it's raining down.
That's the right answer.
In general, men run faster than women.
For me, there was no fundamental difference between the cultures of both countries.
He's having an affair.
Wake me up at eight o'clock.
Tell me why he wasn't there.
That may have affected their decision.
It's been raining for a whole night.
Tom's getting jealous.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that horrible?
I'll buy this bag for you.
The cake is too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Did you ever go to London?
This is our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready.
Mary turned down the invitation to the concert.
When are you going home?
She's sitting around her grandchildren.
The boy fell asleep in his bed.
Jim's still not used to driving on the left-hand side of the road.
He's focused on those riddles.
The man died a few hours ago.
Want to go eat with me?
It feels like a dream to me.
I just ate.
We found out that the front door was locked.
May I speak to Mr. Sato?
This water doesn't smell.
Mr. Smith is his acquaintance.
Thank you for your interest.
We've got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid of flying with a plane.
I've suspected that he's lying, but that doesn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice.
I can't finish reading this thick book in a week.
The selection of time is very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have a choice.
I'm not sure what else I should do.
We've done what we can.
Are there any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked all this way, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
In front of our laws we all agree, but the rich sometimes have more advantage.
He's gonna make it.
I like cats.
The meeting's over at nine o'clock.
Tom's mentally disturbed.
Am I crazy?
We faced a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, don't I?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone's made a mistake.
You better tell Tom not to do it.
My mother's been gone for ten years.
No one's perfect.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with the car, just you can't drive.
May I see your coupon?
He looks serious reading.
Tom married a woman easier than he was.
He's a copy of his father.
He has good words to insult himself.
Maybe I'm fat, but I'm excited.
He tried to kill himself, but in the end he failed.
Do you have any light beer?
I want you to reconsider your decision.
If I reincarnate, I want to be reborn as a cat.
We got a lot of rain this summer.
He's made an important scientific discovery.
He's a student.
Tom's already here, but Bill's not here yet.
Laurie langing.
They suggested it to go alone.
Tom was a good man.
I'll call you back in 20 minutes.
They're swimming.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom tricked Mary.
No less than 40 percent of students go to further education to the university.
Tom put his pencil on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom shuddered his voice so no one could hear it.
You see anything?
What are you looking at?
Is he long-haired?
He greets her every morning, when she enters the school building.
I think he's a doctor.
It's very steep, better to the left.
We didn't really see that accident.
His mother was worried about his son.
What opera is being shown at Lincoln Center right now?
I'm tired.
Tom killed Mary.
The data is often not accurate.
Get up!
We've ordered that six thirty.
We named that dog Tim.
He opened the letter quickly.
Where's the train station?
Tom assigned Mary to follow him.
It's 11 o'clock.
I'm smarter than they are.
The sky is getting darker.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knows him admires him.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
The train just left.
Those guys are crazy!
