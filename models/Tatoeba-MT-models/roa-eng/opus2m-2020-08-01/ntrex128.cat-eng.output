Members of the Welsh Assembly concerned to "identify them as Muppets"
Several members of the Assembly expressed their dismay at the proposal to amend their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh parliament).
This controversy has emerged from the plan to change the name of the assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all different political parties have expressed their concern that this measure may become a source of mockery.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "had a twp or Pwp."
For non- Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party meeting commented that his party as a whole "does not see it with good eyes" and proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh conservative member claimed that his group was "open" to the name change, but also commented that there is too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire.
According to the assembly committee responsible for drafting the legal draft to introduce the changes of names: "The final decision on any qualifier to name the members of the assembly will of course fall within the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 grants the Welsh Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with extensive support for the proposal to change the name of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of members of the assembly, although the committee took the form of "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" was the one that received wider support in the public consultation.
The members of the assembly seem to be suggesting a number of alternatives; however, the attempt to reach a consensus can result in a complete blunder for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in a matter of weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will hold a final vote on their name during the legislative debate.
Macedonians will vote in referendum on their country's name change
Citizens will choose Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name for the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that lasted for decades with the neighboring country of Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted on the fact that the name of its northern neighbour represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to be part of the EU and NATO.
President Macedoni, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the plebiscite on the change of name, said he will ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, feel that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the old people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's none left, both of them."
According to Adam, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
"People have another way of socializing today," he says.
"Bars have already ceased to be that kind of sitting rooms for the neighborhood where people went periodically."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets does not last as long as what his leaders predict "and that sooner or later they return to the place where they came from."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who will not be of any help to the temples remaining in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be of a white race," he says, "and so what they will do is speed up the closure of all churches, since it is totally unlikely that most people moving to these condominiums will end up being members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that was originally formed in the 1930 ’ s left.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who directed a boycott to retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, which resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, it was then when they took over the wagon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's church, proudly described the alley as "the bells of the poor people."
The expert who made the reel sound in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also observed that it was the world's first track track that was played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest track in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What happened to St. Martin's over the past few months, on the other hand, has been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by church leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of secular leaders, wrote in the diocese last July expressing its concern that the diocese "shall transmit costs" to the council, although the council was not involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old boy in search of lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving to search for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on the San Diego KSWB-TV, he had been busing with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of a boy asking for help, and then rowed with a group to the place where the boy was standing to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says that he first thought it was a joy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that he was yelling 'I got bit!
They bit me!'
He had the whole clavicle torn," observed Hammel when he got to the boy.
'Cause everybody comes out of the water,' I cried, 'there's a shark in the water!'' says Hammel.
The boy was airborne to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was seriously ill.
You don't know what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles commented that I work for a few weeks that a shark had been detected in the area, but that it was decided that this species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed for 48 hours access to the beaches from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's, towards the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury's decided to compete in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty product corridors in the style of large warehouses occupied with specialized employees.
These large corridors are only a part of a considerable investment in the beauty products market in the United Kingdom, a market that moves around GBP 28 billion and continues to grow while the fashion and home products sectors remain behind, and will be tested at 11 stores across the country to expand to more stores next year if the proof becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products is the product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space in their shelves that used to be destined for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's claim is that it will double its offer of beauty to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with similar brands that can be found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its range of Boutique makeup products so that most products are now suitable for vegans, an increasingly demanding aspect of the younger consumers.
The retail chain The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open concessions to two stores in Sainsbury's. The first one did it last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second one will open to Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and changing a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has made large supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, stores will increasingly resemble large stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight off the Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's been introducing Argos's sales points to many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, he comments, has served to relaunch the groceries and increase the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy product departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's run a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended up in a hurry not to agree on how to divide the benefits of the drug chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's from its 281 pharmaceuticals business in Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for 125 million GBP.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands of skin products, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, says, "We've transformed the look of our beauty product corridors to improve the environment in front of our customers.
We've invested in trained workers specifically who will be of great help in offering advice.
Our brand range is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way to shop."
Peter Jones "hot" after Holly Willoughby backs an 11 million-dollar deal
The Dragon Star's Den Peter Jones went "hot" after TV host Holly Willoughby got behind a GBP 11 million deal with Jones' life-style brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to do the joint home product business and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had been compared to Gwyneth Paltow's Goop brand.
This morning's 37-year-old presenter used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons' Den Peter Jones infuriated by withdrawing in the last minute of the lucrative business life brand set to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "hot" when the red star on television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at his central empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new arrangements of the host, worth GBP 1.5 million, implied that he would no longer have enough time to dedicate to the joint brand of home products and Truly accessories.
The business had come to compare with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When Willoughby, aged 37, used Instagram to announce his Truly departure, Jones took a private plane towards one of his vacation homes outside the United Kingdom.
According to one source, "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was designed to be his long - term future and will be seen for the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision to step back left every part involved without words.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of goods in its Marlow power plant ready to be sold."
According to experts, the march of this morning's host, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions to the company because of the significant investment that had been made in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and household clothes, and the possibility of delays in their launch.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, aged 52, joined him in the position of president last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the I'm A Celebrity ITV program.
A source near Jones commented last night that "We won't make any comments about their business."
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about possible criticism from the media to make a comment that some would consider "poor of a president" and to have such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, mocking the tone of a news presenter:
"I have not given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first held in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations towards denuclearization are stagnant.
More than three months after the summit held in Singapore in June, the North Korean high diplomat Ri Yong commented on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "correspondence response" by the United States to the first disarmament initiatives made by their country.
However, he observed, the United States continues to apply sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump's point of view, however, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare war in North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
And now we maintain this great relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: ending missile trials, helping to free hostages and return home to the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this room full of people, we'd have about 200," said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
A destroyed island and hundreds of deaths due to a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations in other countries were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population had to be displaced, there was no declaration of any kind of national disaster, previously required to be able to catalyze international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding," Mrs. Sumong said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not certain that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies are allowed to contribute to providing assistance.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still unfortunately not prepared for the anger of nature.
Although Aceh has built refuges in the event of tsunamis, they are not frequent at other costs.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, even if there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge amount of Islands of Indonesia is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to deal with the victims of the earthquake is now heading to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his electoral campaign the improvement of Indonesia's poor infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government faces next year's re-election filled with funding deficits.
Joko also faces the pressure of the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative stance.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced persons are the result of street fights between Christian and Muslim gangs with cards, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes the goal of the plaza with a far shot in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved the Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with his goal scored at the 89th minute on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's port office when his team lost 1 to 0.
The ball was placed on the left before leaving an amazing shot directed toward the second suit.
The shot crossed the entire area with a great elevation as it propelled into the right crest of the door.
The ball finally began its descent over a full jump Kep Arrizabalaga to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the network.
"I was only trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge says at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kanté was coming, I made a knock, and I didn't think much about it, I just threw myself out."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 at the break after scoring a goal every minute 25 through its Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, the Blue team's leader returned from heels to Mateo Kovacic before he tore off from almost half the field and sprained to the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from midfield.
Then he made a magnificent step in the depths, which left Hazard inside the area with the ball under control.
Hazard went through the defense to finish the second pole with a jut with his left leg where he could not reach the goalkeeper of the Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League group phase next Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. in St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for its part, will play Videoton at UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of the collapsed buildings due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place Friday and which caused waves of up to 6 meters, says the spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency on a press conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered in all the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after finding a stabbed woman
The murder investigation was initiated after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with several stabs at Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
The police have asked the residents of the area to see or hear anything about the crime they face in front of the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan's statement, "If the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I'd like to call everyone near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to call anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to pick up anything through the car's camera, to get in touch, as they could have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman they found was Birkenhead's body and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigations continue, the police have commented that they are reporting the facts to the relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one's allowed in or out of the building.
When she learned what had happened, she ran out of words.
Residents are being warned to spend hours until they can get back in.
It felt like a police officer told a man that the whole area was treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible!"
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the area arranged with another van parked outside.
A number of Roman agents inside the agreed area controlling the apartment block.
Any person who can have information that sends a message directly to @MerPolCC is asked to call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and mention 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue of the British Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewriting history"
Their disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the purest-style destruction of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and an "intent to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate surrounding the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of Westminster's palace would become one of the main targets.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was neither ordained nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe he'd end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor he did in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the view of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy to be commemorated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a parliamentary defender in the face of external pressure, in his obvious case of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes a completely accurate representation remains a matter of historical debate.
What is true is that the media conflict of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an recognizable figure that represents a side of this division.
Their achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A killer pig hurts a Chinese farmer dead.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a carved artery and covered with blood near a pork court in the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, reported on Sunday in the South China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs' vaccines into a tent in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As far as we know, he had traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that led to a contiguous pig court.
In court, he said, there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-pound garrison had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had his legs broken and filled with blood," said the cousin, "Wu," as mentioned in Guiyang's evening news.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan entered the market at 4:40 AM to feed the pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither owned by Yuan nor by his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the news of the evening that the pig remained locked up and isolated in order to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered the evidence at the scene of the crime.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating compensation for their death.
Despite being very rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at his Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig nearly 300 kg took a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife could scare the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "unchallenging."
"They like to play.
They're like kids, they're very curious... they don't have the idea of hurting.
Just give them the respect they deserve," he remarked.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains all southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as she moves on the coldest waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, the Rosa will be raining torrential rains all over northern Mexico and southwest of the United States for the next few days.
The Rosa had 138 km/h winds, owned by a category 1 hurricane at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, Eastern US time, and located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to displace north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to develop in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. As the Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to leave a strong tropical humidity northward to the southwest of the United States.
The Rosa will leave Monday up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, tropical humidity will interact with the depression that is approaching to generate generalized torrential rains across the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm rain will cause dangerous streams, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
They are expected from 50 to 100 mm of rain to parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is a possibility that rivers will form, as the situation is rapidly deteriorating due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is entirely discouraged to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrollable rivers, and storms could bring gusts of wind and dust to specific points.
The coming depression will bring torrential rains at determined points on the southern coast of California.
It is possible to record total precipitation above 50 mm, which could cause minor waste flows and slippery paths.
It would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Tropical rain-insulated caskets will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more generalized between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread to the region of the Four Corners on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
In October, there will be several major temperature swings across the United States as the Arctic cooled, although the Tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic changes in temperature within a short time.
The central region of the United States on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences have been recorded almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent heat of summer will try to expand again.
It is expected that the month of October will begin in heat in much of the central and eastern part of the United States, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the South Planes to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities for temperatures above the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw on Thursday the passionate witness of the candidate for membership of the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, the witness broadcasted to six different television channels.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the transmitters interrupting the usual Friday programming due to a turn of events at the last minute: an agreement designed by the senator by Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of charges.
Ford explained to the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted witness, affirmed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million spectators are likely to have seen this witness on Friday.
The company counted the average of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC viewers.
Audience numbers were not available immediately by other channels that broadcast the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
Plus, Nielsen usually has problems calculating the people who see it from his office.
In perspective, it's a similar audience as an American football game or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the opinion leaders that have clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most widely held chain, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's testimony, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS got 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
Interest stays high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying they would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while he was incarcerated by protesters when he was trying to get on a lift to a hearing of the Judicial Affairs Committee.
Flake stayed for several minutes with a dazzling view as she was on live television on CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
They told him you have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!"
Flake said his office had issued a communication and, before the elevator doors were closed, he commented that he would have more to say in the sight of the committee.
In a few hours' time, all the cable and broadcast chains were already broadcasting live when the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote whether or not they were going ahead with Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary to vote on it.
Flake said, on the other hand, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the face-to-face nomination next week, condition demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced of the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake had influence, as it was evident that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to abandon the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and of contempt for national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister of May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Brexit Chequers Plan, where he claims that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU collect taxes together is "abstly absurd."
Wayde Sims' Shooting Murder: Police Detaining Suspect Dyteon Simpson for Killing LSU's Team Player · Global Voices
Police arrested a suspect for shooting Wayde Sims, 20-year-old basketball player who was on the LSU team.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison accused of murder in second degree, according to Baton Rouge police department.
The authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, reports the CBS WAFB's subsidiary.
After asking Simpson, he admitted that Wayde had been shot dead, according to the police.
Your bail has been set at $350,000, as reported by the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge district coroner's office published a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a head-in-head gunshot wound.
The department thanks the state police operational group of fugitives in Louisiana, the state police forensics lab, the Southern University police and the area's citizens for their assistance in the investigation that culminated in this arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement for his "diligence and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
Half a mile, he was on his way and he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 bounces to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach commented that the team is "destructed" and that Wayde's death was "once very strong."
"Things like this are what make you suffer at all times," said Wade.
A Scorpion Volcano serves ash in Mexico City
The ash spawned by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after the crater activity was detected and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring several recent shivers and tremors.
Images on social media where a fine layer of ash is appreciated in car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favor of independence confronted with riot police and thousands of people joined opposite demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on its secession.
A group of independents detained by the riot police began throwing eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds to appear in the streets that were normally invaded by tourists.
Later that same day, beatings took place with the police, who used their roles to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups sang "Don't Forget, Don't Forgive" face-to-face with unionists shouting "Long Live in Spain."
Fourteen people had to be cared for by slight injuries suffered during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not decreased in this region of independentist mentality one year after a referendum was held on 1 October considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence by a vast majority, although the participation rate was low, since the opposites of the secession boycotted the majority vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote by entering the electoral colleges throughout the region, resulting in violent clashes.
The independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place equally, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence protest together with his wife, said he had no more hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we lived one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy about voting, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite gaining a vital victory, although little margin in the autonomic elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have suffered to maintain the momentum this year, since many of their main leaders are in self-imposed or detained exile pending trial for their role in the referendum organization and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the demonstration of support for the police with her phone, and said that the conflict was revived by both sides of the conflict.
"Tression only increases," he comments.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting yourself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the retreat in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after investing a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car repeatedly invested against a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says they caused damage to the doors and the same building.
It's also possible, at some point, someone fired a bullet against the car.
A Menga Play gives Livingston 1 to 0 victory in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston won
The Livingston, which this year had gone up as a category, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which it was just the second defeat of Steven Gerrard in 18 matches as coach at the club in the Ibrox neighborhood.
Dolly Menga's play made a difference, since with this victory, Gary Holt's team is in second place, sharing with Hibernian.
Gerrard's, on the other hand, continue without winning out of the Premiership this season, the next Sunday they're going to face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they're separated by an eight-point difference.
But before that, the Rangers receive this Thursday the Vienna Rapid in Europe League.
The Livingston, in the meantime, widens up to six parties his unbeatable voice in the league, with a Holt as coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingston doesn't take advantage of his chances in front of visitors' direct game
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the score long before the goal, since his direct game caused all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way between the defense, but wasted his chance when he found himself in front of the doorkeeper, and then Alan Lithgow sent the ball out to lie down to try to finish Craig Halkett's head pass, who crossed the door.
The locals were right to let the Rangers approach their area, as they knew they could trouble visitors in isolated plays.
And that's how this decisive goal came about.
The referee whistled a breach against Rangers' interests and Livingston opened up to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could touch it first and finish off from the central part of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated the possession, but he encountered an impenetrable defense and a doorman Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the party,
The stage was repeated on the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop her merit.
For his part, Rangers Allan McGregor stopped with his feet an occasion of Scott Pittman and Lithgow's diverting another Liveston combination game.
The Rangers spent time hanging another ball in the Livingston area, just to be rejected, and two criminals were claimed, one by one of the supposed Halkett entrance to the Glenn Middleton replacement, and the other by hand, they were both rejected.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great performance for Livingston.
One man feels that they were excellent, and they continue to overcome all expectations in this ascending path.
His style of play and staff have hardly changed since his return to the highest category, although much of the merit must be attributed to Holt for the way the team has galvanized since his arrival.
There were a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, in the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be looking after Menga throughout the party.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, though.
Despite the bright moments displayed with Gerrard as a coach, they definitely haven't been able to maintain the level.
They didn't know how to create occasions (only once they clearly overstepped the local defense), and that's what the Rangers, who is in the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Greedy reception for Erdogan in Cologne
All were smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between NATO's two allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU income.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
And it is that this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police raised security concerns to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from congregating in front of the mosque, but a large number of followers gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also felt as they condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of views around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and called dictator by others.
Deptford Traffic Accident: A cyclist dies meeting a car
A cyclist was killed as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street Street Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 local hours.
The vehicle driver stopped and, although the paramedics attended the cyclist, he died in the car.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist dies in a runoff crash on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the site of the Saturday accident.
The metropolitan police said their officers are working to identify the man and report the facts to the closest family members.
The street has been cut off and deviations have been applied to the bus routes, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in an altercation
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation in this high-security prison, according to the centre's office.
The events took place in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, about 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and still endures.
Specialized "turned" agents moved to the scene to put an end to the altercation, in which eight inmates were seen involved, and the avalanche was able to be held on one side.
The officers had to be held accountable for slight injuries to the face at the scene.
According to a prison service spokesman: "We have deployed prison personnel specially trained to try to solve an incident produced in Long Martin prison, which remains.
Six employees had to be cared for with injuries.
We are not tolerating violence in our prisons, and we are sure that those responsible for this altercation will have to be held accountable to the police and could have to spend even more time in the garjola."
There are over 500 inmates in Long Lartin's penitentiary, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief had to be held in a hospital after being attacked by a detainee.
In addition, last October, riot agents took action in prison to solve a serious altercation in which the staff in the centre were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with important streams (the dry areas could benefit)
It's not usual for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of next week when what's left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, with the consequent risk of rivers.
The national weather service has already issued river alerts for Monday and Tuesday to the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly to Phoenix on Tuesday and to approach it on Monday night with rain.
Phoenix's national weather service commented on a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression in a 322-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stayed 64 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the national hurricane center include 50 to 100 mm rain, with isolated points where they would register up to 150 mm in the Arizona Mogollon.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the Central Rocks and the Great Conca, could record from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas where rivers are not at risk, the rain of the Rosa may become very good news, since the region is experiencing severe drought.
Although rivers are a serious cause for concern, some of the rainfall may be very beneficial, as the southwest region is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Control Service, more than 40 percent of Arizona's state suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes it lose strength.
So you're expected to touch the ground in Mexico with rainstorm force on the afternoon or the evening of Monday.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of rivers.
According to weather.com, "it is expected from 75 to 150 mm of rain from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm."
After that, the Rosa will head north across Mexico with a tropical storm force, before reaching the Arizona border in the first hour of Tuesday with a tropical power of depression, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach the south of Utah well into Tuesday night.
"The main risk we expect from Rosa or what's left of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the Southeast American desert," according to the national hurricane center.
Rain is expected to cause dangerous rivers and waste streams in the deserts, and land-scraping in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four Arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 p.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he is "stable."
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have made a call for anyone who can have some sort of recording of the facts with the mobile phone to get in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered the pettyness and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the rejection vote for the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," declared Trump in an election act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "sickness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh declared before Congress Thursday, denying bluntly and emotionally the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford having sexually abused her decades ago, when both of them were teenagers.
Ford also made a public statement regarding his claim.
The president said on Saturday that, on that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality and courage."
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an admirable trajectory of service to citizenship," he commented to the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of the Republican voters' participation rate in elections in half the term of office.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually going," she said.
"That's why I go everywhere fighting for our great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are "resisting and obstructing."
It is expected that the first key trial vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment will take place as late as Friday, according to CNN's report to a Republican party leader assistant.
Hundreds of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to grow
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the giant waves that hit the shores, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that has affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast towards dusk, dragging many people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and didn't run right away, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokeswoman of the BNPB disaster relief agency in a communication in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, trunks, houses, destroyed everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved by open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There are people who climbed up a tree running from the tsunami and were able to survive, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency are appreciated by the amount of shops and damaged buildings, sunken and sunken bridges and a water-encompassed mosque.
The Relics continued to shake this coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquake series were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographic features of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "reputable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped in the wreckage of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
According to Nugroho, the dead and the damage could rise to the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, nearest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were completely paralyzed and so there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho says.
There live more than 300,000 people," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, which could unfortunately end up much worse," she says.
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the agents said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a social media-shared amateur, you can feel like a man on the top floor of a building gives desperate warnings to street people about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a water wall pops up by the sea, carrying buildings and vehicles.
Reuters couldn't immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a widespread cut in the power supply that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
Although the army has begun to send humanitarian aid to cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, evacs continue to need food desperately, as well as other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Despite the fact that World Vision workers in Donggala were able to reach the city of Palu, where employees lie in canvas shelters installed in the yard of their office, during the course they had to witness scenes of total destruction, Doseba says.
“They told me they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
While relief groups made the desolate gesture of initiating relief work, some people complained that they were preventing humanitarian workers from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fundraising, supplies and foreign personnel can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a zone of national disaster.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Red Cross Indonesia.
"Once the government says "well, it's a national disaster," we can start asking for international assistance, but that level has not yet been declared."
While staying the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, friends and family members of missing persons kept hoping that the miracle and their loved ones would escape the desolate story of natural disasters.
Saturday, a child was rescued from being trapped in a sewer.
Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian National Paragliding Team coach, had trained two of the paragliders missing for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped at Roa Roa Hotel, there were his students.
“As a senior in the scope of the windshield, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that in the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages for whatsApp to the competitors of Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a blue double mark.
“I think that means that the messages were not received,” he added.
Thiefs take $26,750 during the filling of an automatic cashier in Newport on the Levee

According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper is renamed Ye
The Kanye West rapper is renamed Ye.
On Saturday, as she announced the change on Twitter, she wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West.”
For some time in West, 41 years old, he motegen with the nickname Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurs before its appearance in the program Saturday Night Live, in which it is expected to present its new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled his participation for "emotional reasons," according to the program's author.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think it's the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," said West at the beginning of this year, while talking about the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us.
I've passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confusing part, everything.
The album is more a reflection than we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known by several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, has used his nickname with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexico's President AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians, when little is left for the country to fulfill the 50th anniversary of a cruel retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that “the military force would never again be used to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when student leftist movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening up more free public universities,
he said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted by criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funds allocated to AI
"While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money they spend on research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, a specialist in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arrive after several members of the U.S. government have announced measures in the field of AI, although there is a general lack of formal strategy in AI.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become number 1 in the world as far as innovation in AI was concerned in 2030.
"Exploring the research budget in AI would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be pioneers for the next progress in the AI field," said Lee.
“Dualizing funding could double the chances that the US will achieve the next great discovery in AI,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book titled AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the general director of the company Innovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading AI companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an AI system that surpassed the American Othello player with the best ranking and later exercised as executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively valued previous U.S. government technological competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next would take place to identify the next visionaries.
"U.S. researchers often have to work hard to obtain public scholarships," Lee said.
According to Lee, "it's not China that takes academic leaders; it's companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university eminences to work in the AI field.
Lee commented that the US task in the area of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
"I think you should automatically offer permanent residence cards to the doctoral students in AI," he added.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council presented its latest-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
"The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way as the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other U.S. public agencies give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than China," Lee pointed out.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defence of the United States established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, designed to involve industrial partners and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Artificial Intelligence Committee.
Besides, this month DARPA has announced a billion-dollar investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the Foundation of Natural Sciences is concerned, it currently allocates more than 100 million USDs a year to research in AI.
In the meantime, no measures have been applied for months in relation to American legislation that was intended to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's accession applications to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, holds that its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim from its territory and has banned it from entering NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign doubts whether at least 50% of the required participation will be achieved so that the referendum will be valid.
The question given in the referendum paper is: “Are you in favour of accession to NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created following the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely in the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that it will abide by the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there had been no irregularity at 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared with 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” declared 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski to the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Macedoni, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted at the referendum held in Macedonia on the country's change of name, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO to Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Before the Parliament of Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarvarkov was preparing a small stage and setting up chairs in front of the tents installed by the boycotters.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick to it with our head, not the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev states that NATO integration will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the vast majority will vote in favour, because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev said a ‘yes’ would mean ‘confirming our future’.
In a survey published last Monday by the Macedonia Political Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another survey, led by the Macedonian television channel Telma, 57% of the polls plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said he would vote "yes."
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would mean the first hard time for pro-Western government policy since it took over last May.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, makes a goal after racing all the defense of Brighton
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defense in Manchester City victory goes for 2 to 0 in the disputed match at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Aguaro scored a goal every minute 65 in a play that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentinean frontman got a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He went by speed between three Brighton defenses, scratching his foot in the game field.
Then Agüero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He raided a defense before overcoming a few more on the shore of Brighton's area.
Then he stepped over to his left and found Sterling.
The English forwarder returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, in Agüero, which with his right leg beat Brighton's doorman, Mathew Ryan, with a jute that slipped into the inside of the net on the right side.
“Aguero has foot trouble,” Pep Guardiola, coach of the City, told journalists.
"We decided he'd be playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky I scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in fighting for the Premier League.
His goal arrived in the 29th minute.
In that game, Agüero received the ball in depth in the field of Brighton and
He made a beautiful pass in space on the left side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before putting it in Sterling on the long pole.
Sky Blues' leader finished the ball on the inside of the network before he got out on the bottom line.
The City faces the Hoffenheim on Tuesday in part of the Champions League group phase at 18:55 a.m., the Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Without options, Scherzer wants to delete the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off fight, there were not many reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to go out to the pitcher's monticle on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold an advantage game about Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have a chance to play play off.
The Rockies secured a medal with the victory for 5 to 2 against the Nationals Friday night, but still seek to get their first title of division.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can go out knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably fight every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would you want me to lose this game?"
The Nationals still have to announce an open launcher for Sunday, but apparently they are determined to let Scherzer drop if this situation occurs.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, held a warm-up session on Thursday and launched on Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right-wing launcher has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 stripes removals in 220 2/3 tickets this season.
Trump's doing a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of Republican participation in half-term elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
It's five weeks away for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the great, great, I don't introduce myself, but I really do, and that's why I'm all over the world fighting for the fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You can see this horrible group of democrats, it's happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, you see their pettyness, their poor intentions.
They don't care who they hurt, over who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is "resisting and obstructing."
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he reverberated, and called out the Democrats 'frozen, mean, dirty and false'.
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic Senator of the Senate Judicial Committee, which led to a loud shout from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
You filtered the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait a minute... this was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party has ceased to be a diverse party.
It's intolerant to those who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censure me, I was not surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a series of British parliamentarians to whom we've been told we're not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated in a similar manner because she manifested herself resolutely against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, these are similar issues to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
On the notice of the Friday meeting of the Labor Party of Nottingham, it was announced that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday evening have been exactly like that.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of "more generous and kind" policies has long been forgotten, if ever.
It is increasingly evident that divergent views are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I previously thought I was sharing a similar political vision expected me to take a 180-degree turn and take positions that I would never have adopted, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made so that my candidacy is not renewed, centre policies are denounced and I'm told it shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just about me.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, as the messages I get are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who are faced every day with a stream of gender-based and racist attacks, and they don't get stuck.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a diverse party, and with every motion of "untrusted" or every change in the rules of selection, the party is becoming more strangled.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice and have been advised to keep my head low, not to be so expressive and "it would be all right."
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time of study, stimulated by Thatcher's negligent government, which left my entire class literally submerged, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, either as a local advisor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction in any way.
To those who promoted the motion Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is walking towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, the message I want to convey is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of renewal of my candidacy or any political interest will prevent it from acting, in my opinion, for the benefit of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeated Ayr Leaders · Global Voices
Two last-minute rehearsals distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved victory in this vibrant party of Lieutenant's Premiership day.
The Ayrs, who are the only top ten team, occupy the first position on the ranking table.
In the end, the local team imposed itself because of its defensive superiority and the fact that it knew how to take better advantage of the opportunities, and Coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
"The parties we've played so far have tested us and we're still being beaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: “Congratulations for the Ayr have taken on opportunities better than we have. ”
Grant Anderson's trial at minute 14, converted by Frazier Climo, put ahead the Ayrs, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, which was handed over by the Warriors party, allowed Melrose to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot wrote an unconverted essay.
Climo expanded the advantage of the Ayrs with a sanction and, in the middle of it, wrote down and converted a essay to put score 17-5 in favor of the Ayrs at rest.
But the Melroses started well the second part and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Then the party interrupted for a long time because of the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, who retired on the bunker, and at the dam the Ayrs extended the distance with a Stafford McDowall trial converted by Climo.
Next, the alternate captain Blair Macpherson was warned with a yellow card and, again, the Melrose seized the superiority of one more man with an unconverted test of Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted, and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a plate in Climo without a ball, from the sanctions lineup, MacPherson wrote down a counter-testing behind the penetrating Ayr mole.
Climo marked, as he had done almost since the dam, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot of David Armstrong and put the ball on Gregor Henry's third line to score the fifth essay on the local team.
The Star of the Still Game series seems to be ready to start a new career in the restoration sector.
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be ready to move into the hotel sector, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis' character in the popular BBC series, who has been writing and co-protagonizing with Greg Hemphil, his comical partner for a long time.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on it, although a source from The Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter the "flowering restoration sector" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, without coastline, expects the court to reopen the road to the Pacific
The sailors patrol their barge covered in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a blue sea flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazons are enthralled by the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia's landlocked land, the memory of a lost coastline in the face of Chile in a conflict of raw resources in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the yearning to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia hopes for the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, no need to say, waits with a positive stance for the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the resolution of the TIJ on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will dictate in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile is obliged to negotiate the concession of a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes laid down in Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court would decide in favor of Bolivia and, if it did, it would not change much.
The UN agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The resolution of the TIJ, which takes place only six months after the final allegations have been made, indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law specialist.
And far from seeing herself in favor, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a fallback in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
"The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has affected any gesture of good will on the part of Chile," he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep conversations after this episode.
The two countries haven't traded ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Tribunal's decision-making was exceptionally quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of discrepancy, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can be trusted in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation won't eliminate nuclear weapons if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The Minister urged the United States to keep the promises made at a Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when it seems that U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is about to resume the stagnant nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri says it's a chimera to think that the continued sanctions and the US's objection to a statement that ends the Korean War can make North Korea ever kneel.
Washington distrusts accepting the statement if Pyongyang does not make significant disarmament moves before.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang takes seriously the issue of renouncing an arsenal that the country considers the only means to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion parades reveal the latest range of large-scale hats, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the bridge a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions from their SS19 collection, which brightened the style defined at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, the Instagram has been ravaged by very impractical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the gateway.
Valentino's outstanding piece was an exaggerated beech hat, adorned with a wide, feather-shaped wing, which flooded the heads of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were enchanted joints, a hazelnut hat and even a pine tree, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extrafoil masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of vivid colors, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than no high seam.
One creation looked like a complete team of submarines, with tubes and glasses, while another seemed like a hollow ice-cream cone.
And if you follow the big fashion trends, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
Large-sized hats climb the heels of "the Bomb", a straw hat, with two-foot wide wings, which everyone has brought, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so impractical that it spread through social networks led to another great creation on the aisle: a bag of straw for the beach, almost as large as the model dressed with a bather that wore it.
The dark orange bag, decorated with raffia locks and finished with a white leather strap, was the highlight of the collection The SS19 Riviera by Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Considering that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a pity to ignore the demand for large-scale accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain an academic excellence path that continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are working to offer a service of the best level to students and parents.
The goal of independent schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, for their careers and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a very popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak a man in a language you understand, you’ll get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is a very important reminder that we cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the exams of this year, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages obtained the highest grade A.
Data, compiled from 74 SCIS schools, reflected that 72% of students obtained A superior qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital competences that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages, as a subject of choice, are kept in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and in other places.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the United Kingdom Employment and Competence Commission revealed that 17% of the reasons employers gave for filling their vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills.
So language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
As there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of a person’s choice of career, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such a permanent competence.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of competition.
According to a survey conducted in 2013 by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and the French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double digit percentage.
So investing in language teaching is important to children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find important work.
There is diversity between schools in Scotland in terms of languages taught.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future, by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your son's interest is, he'll always be able to choose between a series of languages in independent schools, which have staff teaching specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the necessary skills to succeed, regardless of what the future may bring.
In today's global trading environment, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as “international communicative competences”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to Scottish young people.
We have to do this right.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will start with the Lakers in San Diego Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But you still have to determine the minutes you're going to play.
"It'll be over one and less than 48," Walton said at the Lakers' official site.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers journalist, tweeted that James will probably be playing a few minutes.
After the early training this week, James was asked about his plans for the six Lakers' pre-season party calendar.
"I don't need pre-time parties at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's rally to West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump's scheduled meetings for the next week, including visits to sympathetic sites, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the High Court vacancy is pending, Trump intends to obtain support for the next half-term election, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can be seen online in the link that was specified below, via live video broadcast via YouTube.
Trump probably dropped the hearing he started this week with the candidate appointed to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense because of the charges of sexual abuse he was facing, while the Senate's planned confirmation vote remained on hold for up to a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this rallying wave is to help the Republicans who present themselves to the delicate elections in November to collect momentum.
So the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for the next week are aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“The control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel as many states as he can, as long as we are heading for a season of ambush,” said a Trump spokesman who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could bring together supporters "of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the coverage of Pittsburgh's media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won for over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavourable results in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and push him into the polls," commented Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the American team shows their ambition to keep their hopes alive in front of the individual Sunday games
After three unequaled sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The dynamic swing pendulum is an invented sport concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So which side is the positive dynamics on now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're in a little positive mood," said Jordan Spieth as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has one advantage, four points ahead, twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely by the state in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth's been lethal from tea to green and he's setting an example.
Gutural screams of celebration rose in intensity as he continued his turn and put a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the game in hole 15 with a similar cry, the kind that indicates that he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
"You have to try your best and worry about your own party," Spieth pointed.
It's all that's left to these players now.
18 slots to leave a fingerprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed feeling of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but lovely European couple carry four out of four and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a crazy Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the crazy Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
For this result and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the public, it is reaffirmed that they are players on Sundays, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, who married Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes plunged the Spanish and the Swedish into a hole they never had a chance to get out of.
Sunday, though, there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The fourballs and the forsomes are very fascinating to see the interactions between the matches, the advice they give and the ones they don't give, and the way a strategy can change all of a sudden.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this forsome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight than some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe reaches the end of the Ryder Cup with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing the forks and forsomes on Saturday with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and to leave his record, so far, on four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to keep the trophy he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that was not right in the morning fourballs and put the series on 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance to the foursomes and won two matches, but they couldn't reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points at the 12 individual Sunday games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to get four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as the Molliwood nickname after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they called a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American debuter Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic genius sporadic spores, but lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning nightclubs, remarried Henrik Stenson in the forsomes and fell for two to one against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked as the first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have everything in its face on a pleasant and windy day in southwest Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times the tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a reference point for Americans on Saturday by getting two points.
They won a two-to-one victory against Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls, and later they won Poulter and Rory McIllroy for four to three in the foursomes, after they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team had put a four-point difference in individual parties, although Furyk's title team only needs to tie in to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack coming Sunday is out of range.
North Korea declares that it will not be unilaterally “in no way” disarmed if no signs of trust are appreciated
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs informed the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying their mistrust in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant measures of good will” during the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing centre and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not observe any responses in consonance with the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not start disarmament unilaterally in any way."
While Ri resumed the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased "unnuclearization" approach for which North Korea would be rewarded as he took gradual action, his statements seemed significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization in full, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim committed himself to working on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has reported that Pyongyang must eliminate its nuclear weapons before.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"The US insists that denuclearization must first occur and that the pressure level is increased by sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the 'war-end declaration'," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a flame of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are intensifying our mistrust."
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If the part involved in the issue of denuclearization were South Korea instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stage of stagnation.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what he held last year, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that pointing to the U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump named Kim from "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
Last year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said that much remains to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there were no terms for this and that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared on Thursday to the UN Security Council: “The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm complete and definitive denuclearisation.”
The Security Council has unanimously launched sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in a bet to cut the funding of the Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then reported that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip wasn't very good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but in a few hours North Korea accused him of making "own demands of a gangster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantling a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States took “measures in consonance”.
He said that Kim had informed him that the "measures in consonance" he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Course on Rest Habits · Global Voices
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing culture of studying all night, stimulated by caffeine.
One scholar observed that university students number one in the world are often left out on the basics about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, "Why are you telling me now, all this, in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever talked to him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he reported to The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are told the basic concepts about how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Health Services at the University, stated that the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dorm, where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, bamboos and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how sports performance affects sleeplessness, and the importance of keeping a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that students’ conduct will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride of staying awake all night still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and growing pressure suffered by students make sleep deprivation an increasing problem.
Making sure to enjoy a sound of good quality for long enough should be a "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety, added, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into inanition mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of Physics Chemistry and Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes in the last year of his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to conduct a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students take into account the fact that they should be alarmed when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's dissected team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's house, which means another crash outside.
Hemox's team sought to add his first home victory from February 4 to 1 victory in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 matches as a coach to leave his team on the drift, 8 points from the Hearts, unstoppable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before half part, and it never seemed that the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to match the marker.
While the Rangers now fall into the sixth square, Livingston goes up to third position behind the Hibernian by difference of goals.
And Rangers could face more difficulties later, as Line Judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object apparently launched from the pleasure.
Gerrard made eight changes in respect to the alignment that the Ayr swept into the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same eleven headlines that ripped a dot against the Hearts last week, and he was probably satisfied by the way his team, well organized, suffocated their rivals at all times.
While the Rangers dominated the possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored at the two-minute party, when Menga's first intervention left Scotland Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the half-fielder threw away and squandered the great occasion.
A sudden launch of Keaghan Jacobs hit Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive companion Alan Lithgow only took a detour to the rear pole.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than to believe in their third game at the end.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a criminal on the 15-minute signal, since he and Steven Lawless met, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only led two shots to carry the first part, but Ibrox's first porter, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the docile front Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of Livi in minute 34 might have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only for their efforts.
Again, the Rangers couldn't deal with Jacobs' worked play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for a simple final.
Gerrard acted in the pause by changing Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and the change had an impact almost immediately, as the end of it happened to Morelos, although the imposter Kelly ran into the blockade.
However, the Livingstons continued to catch visitors' attention by playing exactly as they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's gang could have given in to the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow took a detour from the corner.
The Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still demanded a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but Thomson again turned his eyes thick.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a Sunday Morning page in Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally gave rise to the device we know as the Geiger counter.
The Count Geiger, a pillar of science since then, also became a pile of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, apparently failed cowboy physicists:
"What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these earphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emanating from radioactivity on minerals."
Evans: "Sure it's exploding now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and eliminate malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them to the laboratory.
You can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then reinject them
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then reinjecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we've obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
HER2 protein "encourages the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" these cells as treating cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West branched on a pro-Trump diatre with a MAGA cap after his performance in the SNL program.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was called to the study during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated the US President Donald Trump, and said he would present himself at the 2020 elections.
After his third song of the night, entitled Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, began to criticize the Democrats and to repeat his support for Trump.
"Whenever I talk to white people they say to me, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I cared about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which Hollywood's star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate Judicial Committee for complaints of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval on social media.
It's not clear whether Rock meant to ridicule West with the publication.
But West complained to the audience that it wasn't well treated in the backseat because of the hat he was wearing.
"I was threatened in the background.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
I was harassed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" while he said he'd put on the Superman's layer because then they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments provoked the audience's calls at least twice and the program team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, that he had a reporter who explained to the publication: "The entire study was completely silent."
West acted as a last-minute substitute for Ariana Grande, the former of which the Mac Miller rapper had died a few days ago.
West puzzled most of the audience with the interpretation of the song And Love it, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West got support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "One of the bravest spirits: Thanks for Detaching MULTITUDE."
But the host of the debate program, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "who it is and who it is absolutely wonderful."
"But I've chosen not to reward someone -- buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art" -- who I believe adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And we too," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and that it was now "the former being known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague rapper, Snoop Dogg, was previously called Snoop Lion and Prince's missing music legend changed its name to a symbol and later the artist known as Prince.
Prosecution of attempted murder for stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder following the arrest of a man on Friday in eastern Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhacklove.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast court of first instance on Monday.
The D.A. will review the charges.
The Throne Game Star, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to represent the role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's series of violent medieval fantasy throne game.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of virile hero, claiming that these papers imply that young boys often believe they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with Culture magazine in The Sunday Times, Kit said he believed that "something had gone wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the throne game co-protagonist, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted that being strong enough to face this problem.
"Personally, I wonder where we've been wrong about masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we now experience?"
According to Kit, television can be part of the responsibility of increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its virile characters.
He added, "What is born and what is acquired?
What does it show on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they have to have this face of manhood?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because something's definitely done wrong with young boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any throne game prequel or sequel when the end of the series is planned for the next summer, saying that he is full of battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will feature a reposition of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his partner Rose is the best thing that has provided him with Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my future life," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of the character who represents Kit, Jon Snow, in the winning fantasy series of an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health workers.
Only the second quarter of 2018 declared 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV for this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health workers at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem for China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT collective is common.
Considering the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many transmissions of disease are due to a lack of proper sexual precautions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from Republican Party senators and dismantles "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
US representative Maxine Waters reported on Saturday charges that a member of her staff had posted personal information from three Republican senators in the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the demands prompted criticism and far-right websites.
"True lies, lies, and more derogatory lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Supposedly, the published information contained the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by an unknown person in the Capitol during a session of the Senate commission on complaints of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters Office and revealing information from a Waters staff member, denounced the Capitol.
"This baseless denunciation is completely false and a mere lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of which have been compromised by these false and fraudulent complaints, was not responsible in any way for this information filtering.
This baseless denunciation is completely false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated criticism online, including that of White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation," wrote Fleischer.
"That makes you think you don't have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
You don't have to question the prosecutor's motives.
It must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of looking too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to overthrow Waters in the mid-legislature elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Important if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We'll make sure the criminals reveal themselves," he continued, "and they'll be legally held responsible for all the actions they've done and that they've hurt each and every member of my staff."
Johnny's Criticism English Strikes Again: Rowan Atkinson's Limited Spy Parody · Global Voices
It is already a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this reposition of Johnny English's franchise for action-media parody, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and re-appeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
Is this humorous self-satisfying about how despicable we are going to be a new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the incompetent eye and rubber face Johnny English has been able to renew for a second time his license to twist everything, his name indicates more than anything else that is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking territories with a tradition of going to the cinema.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquid glamur, has a bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Fire Cars at the 2012 London Olympics inaugural ceremony.
Originally, it was based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson who represented Barclaycard's now forgotten television ads, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There's one or two good moments on this last trip of JE.
I loved Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the blades of the propeller reciting him in the helmet.
You see, Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is there, but humor seems quite vague and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" film brands like 007 and Impossible Mission now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems intended for children rather than adults and, to me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as ingenious or focused as the silent gags of Mr. Bean's character representing Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An IT pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and has revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, which causes the dismay of the service agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and besieged figure, who already suffers from a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this framed character of Teresa-May, but the script does not go further.
His intelligence advisors inform him that, as each active spy is in danger, he will have to recover one from retirement.
And this includes poor Johnny English, now employed as a professor at some luxury institution, but teaching off-office classes on how to become a covert agent, with some good guys, such as when English offers a spying academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his Dr. Bough Ducker, a role that once again represents Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin from when things get very ugly in Her Majesty's secret service go into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic billionaire technology that he claims can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous madness: dressed as waitresses, they burn a French fast-food restaurant, they sow chaos by smuggling aboard Volta's luxury yacht and English causes great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been drawn from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and the noise it presents, it all seems like a children's program.
Pretty normal stuff.
As with Johnny English movies, it has not been helpful to think whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to have a four-day workweek and cover five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will have to consider a radical plan according to which the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of the companies to pass on the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers giving them a more festive day.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would fit with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country to favor the workers.
The four-day shift in a week's work has the support of Trade Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced Labour Party source stated in The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't be overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits the party's perspective of balancing the economy in favour of the worker and in the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman, "A four-day workweek is not party politics and the party is not considering it."
The shadowed minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The Minister's plans in the shadow also imply that water business shareholders might not recover the entire investment, as the Labour government could apply "deducts" for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place employees in joint ventures and to create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of private sector firm shares to employees, which are expected to incorporate annual dividends of up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the Kavanaugh investigation of the FBI could make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of his appointment for the Supreme Court at least one week, and raised the question as to whether the Agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could shed light on something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I'm serious," said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he did.
He was firm, determined and sure."
But Graham's vote seems to be on fire.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would present an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it roundly," Graham added referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people I appoint will be able to verify it.
He's 36.
I don't see anything changing again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents a programme of absolutely impressive stars, which carry out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global objective of the event to end extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help fight it actively.
To receive a free entry for the event (whether someone wants to pay a VIP ticket), the attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to arouse awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What success has Global Citizen achieved when 12 years are left to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand an action call or just one more case than we call "clictivism" (those who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which have helped to achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will have affected the lives of more than 2.250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and ads derived from their shares, of which at least $10,000 million has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that currently the protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the The Power of Nutrition Foundation, an investor and director's association in the United Kingdom, which is committed to "helping children grow up as much as possible" and promises to send to Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a single page of history," said Ambassador The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions called for in the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on their website asking, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said, "It's going to be a long and hard road, sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and apartheid movements we're going to win, because we're stronger together."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will be performing at the New York annual event, who will present Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to hinder Russian energy exports (Secretariat of Interior)
Washington can, "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, has revealed US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke has reported that Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates with the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their will to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, for blocking, to prevent its energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendees of the event celebrated by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that self-defines itself as the "eye of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are actually the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is about to take advantage of and replace fuels," he said, indicating that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements arrive while Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, instead of Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to leave the North Stream 2 "indecent" gas pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which cost $11 billion, will double the capacity of the existing pipeline at 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, declared Russia's Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Department of Energy Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the German sector, IDF (Federation of German Industries), called on the US to step aside EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," declared Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren has stated that she will "hold" her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that he would "think positively" his candidacy for the presidency after the elections of the legislature.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government's fracture, for women to hold high office," said The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take my candidacy seriously."
Warren intervened on President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said he was "carrying the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm honestly worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren has been honest about his criticisms at Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Friday tweet, Warren said, "It's clear that an FBI investigation is needed before the election."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed that they should not be introduced by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" Massachusetts voters said the Senator should not be presented, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey revealed a wider support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile names among Democrats who were taken into account in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially disclose his decision in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes TEPT Track Palin's affection for Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after graduating on September 11, 2007
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident
"With what my own son has been going on since he came back, I can understand other families suffering from TEPT ramifications and some of the emotional wounds our soldiers return with," he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following about his son and other war veterans: "turn a little bit different, get tough again, wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement of domestic violence and gun retention under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
18 state representatives and the district presented a friendly curiae Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of Grace vs. Sessions' lawsuit that the American Union for Civil Liberties filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and the children of the violent gang member" attacked her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, allowing undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, declared on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal laws require asylum applications to be awarded according to particular facts and circumstances of demand, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denies immigrants' entry harms the US economy, as it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
" Asylum is available for those people who leave their country for persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in their announcement of June 11 of this policy.
Asylum has never meant to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a spirit to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is worsening.
"The atmosphere is very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calmed her sick son in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
Lack of drinking water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to take over flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of wounded, and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured their shoulders, are outside Palu military hospital, as the patients are treated outside because of the loud shakings that are repeated.
Tears were denying her eyes as she explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where she was with her wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," explained Haris to Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a village wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help crying and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're all right."
The US ambassador accuses China of harassing itself with "advertising ads."
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page announcement in an American newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed China Daily's payment supplement on Wednesday to The Des Moines Register, Iowa's state's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of getting involved in the US Congress elections on November 6, U.S., a charge that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get involved in the US election marked what American officials have told Reuters that this is a new phase of the Washington campaign to intensify pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a more intense trade war and have seen oranges in mutual imports.
China's vengeful spiders at the beginning of the trade war aimed to punish state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed US workers, farmers and companies.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion paper on The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It's redoubled harassment with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press."
"In publicizing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the beloved American tradition of freedom of expression and free press when introducing a payment ad to The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the kiosk down here in Beijing, you'll find few dissenting voices and you won't see any real reflection of the disparate views that Chinese citizens can have on the worrying economic path of China, since the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers ransacked the offer to publish" his article, but he didn't say the name of the publication.
Republicans separate women's voters before elections to the media with the Kavanaugh disaster, they warn analysts
Since many of the top Republicans support and defend the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who faces various sexual assault requests, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the upcoming elections of the middle legislature.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high, and most republicans are already showing that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things cannot be undone," explained Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation to be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants shouted "November is coming!" (November is approaching) while protesting at the Senate lobby while Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be out of the picture," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they've already been tall; it's true.
But it could have been more, especially among the voters of women from suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often don't vote while they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public witness, where he detailed his applications for sexual assault on the High Court candidate, analysts suggest that a negative response could be made if Republicans pressed with confirmation.
"This has become a GOP mess," said Michael Steele, President of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the board or the final vote, nor about Kavanaugh sitting in the defendant's bank. It's also about how Republicans have managed this issue and how they've treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps to elect Democrats, on the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford style and the Kavanaugh witnesses, with the balance that is slightly to the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the polls believe in Ford's testimony in an uncertain or probable way, while 35 percent claim to believe in Kavanaugh in an uncertain or probable manner.
In addition, about 38 percent said that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or no doubt during his witness, while about 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the applications filed by Ford and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the effects of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the High Court candidate taught him genitals at a party while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open Source Platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," said he of the emerging company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in one browser at a time.
What is exclusive of the personal online data store is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company integrates resources, processes and skills that are suitable for the Solid platform to be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some of the staff developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that nobody on his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty during the night.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a Saturday publication at the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new integrated web on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
For the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate about network neutrality.
Even during Inrupt's launch, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the Cross Victory of the I GM · Global Voices
The only clergyman in the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter was honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the guard on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandsons uncovered a memorial tomb on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after the prowess of his grandfather.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns."
Later he ran to the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage" he moved the row forward before throwing himself over a cannon with one hand and leaving three members of the detachment astonished.
Lieutenant Colonel was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's actions were a feat he could never match, which gives you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the courage of a real hero is shown by the support that he will receive from many people.
The MMA fans who stayed out of sleep all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine you're up all night to see Bellator 206 and you're denied the most important event.
San José's poster contained 13 fights, including six of the main card, and they were to be seen live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, the spectators of the United Kingdom were amazed when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset about having spent the night awake until the morning to see the fight.
One follower on Twitter described the change for cartoons as "a kind of vomiting joke."
"The government's rules say at 6:00 this content is inappropriate, so they changed to the children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppe la carte, yes."
Company president Bellator Scott Coker said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we won't be able to resolve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at yours.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I changed the channel, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do, we tried to show it again for the followers, but it's over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown feeling lower than the rest of the people because of their sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't notice until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
In the Desert Island Discs Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give other people hope.
He also said that being a father was of little importance in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months of sick leave.
Daley, who appeared like a wreck on Laverne's first program, said he felt "less than" the others because "he was socially unacceptable as children and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, not to disappoint anyone when he ended up discovering his sexuality.
The twice winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his picture of the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to ask other countries to describe homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The tricampion of the world explained that he had fallen in love with a man, American director Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013, "took me by surprise."
Last year, Daley married the winner of an Oscar, 20 grander than him, but says the age difference was never a problem.
According to him, when you pass by when you're young (he took part in his first Olympic Games when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar heights and lows.
The couple were parents in June of a boy whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
"If you'd asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
Her son is said to be like his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept his death and one of the last things he asked for was whether they already had tickets to London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front line.
"I couldn't tell him," father, you wouldn't be there to take the first row," he said.
"As he held his hand, he stopped breathing and was not until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in some Olympic Games. There wasn't a better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Proud by Heather Small), which he had heard during the preparation for the Olympics and which still put on his hen's skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Worse Mickelson showed up at Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will record Sunday in playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to change his physical state if he doesn't want to turn into an unhappy tape.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to record for 12 times, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of action, as has usually been done in the United States, the winner of five main tournaments spends his time as animator and working in his field game, hoping to correct what hurts him.
He's never made the most direct drivers, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where long rough usually punishes deviated blows.
And if his own trajectory is not discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will face the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined the Tommy Fleetwood Rookie to win the four matches this week.
If Americans, four points down at the beginning of the 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson's game could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He perfectly understood his role for that day, he slapped me in the back and surrounded me with his arm as he told me he would be ready the next day," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of self-confidence.
It's a hall of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams earlier and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained, and that's how we thought we should move forward.
He wants to be there, like any other."
Sunday, Mickelson will be outnumbering Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mean the end of a race at the Ryder Cup that hasn't matched his individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has contributed intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, joking, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great teammate," he said.
"I think younger players also had fun getting in with him this week, which was fun to see.
He brings much more besides his game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can vanish soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become a hard day.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team captained by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but they finally won the victory for the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"You keep remembering that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little by little," said Bjorn, on the picture, after seeing the 2018 team win for 5-3 Friday as well as yesterday, leaving the score in 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story has taught me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
You have to go to every machine tomorrow.
You have to get out and do it all right.
This doesn't end until the dots are up on the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep our focus to do it.
I said, I focus on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also remember who our rivals are: the best players in the world."
Delighted at the performance of their players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush with this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It's great to be there with a partner when it's all right, but individual duels test your ability to play golf as much as possible.
That's the message you have to send to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to get out and also get the best out of himself."
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk, hopes his players will make it better individually than on the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about the last day's ride, as he was part of Brookline's winning team before he ended up losing in the "Miracle of Medina" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start with a good foot, as looked at Brookline and Medina.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure in these central duels.
We've prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the rally against Rory McIllroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I've chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities," Bjorn says about his selection for individual clashes.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The German army's new frigate should have ended in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it won't do so, at least until the coming year due to defective systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg frigates, has postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Armada in 2014, but the post-construction problems marked the terms of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships that Armada commissioned in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is believed that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ships missiles, as well as technology against poaching, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods of maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years without going through national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that state-of-the-art ships, which were expected to be able to project in Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they come into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was already known last year, when the German army rejected the boat and returned it to Drashman Blohm & Voss of Hamburg.
It was the first time the Armada returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details are known of the reasons for the return, but German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it unusable if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, since approximately 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for the old Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, reducing its performance and limiting the capacity of the Army to add future improvements to it.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rhineland-Pfalz will weigh twice as much as similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also beginning to pose a problem.
It is believed that it has reached some amazing 3.100 million euros (3.600 million dollars) from an initial budget of 2.200 million euros.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of special importance, taking into account recent warnings that indicate the weakening of Germany's maritime military power.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Armada "is running out of ships that can be used."
The officer has claimed that the situation has worsened over time because old ships were no longer used, but none was provided as replacement.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Armada.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of the bats
A new investigation carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed themselves.
It is expected that discoveries can provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Foundation of Scotland will continue the soprano and common bats, as well as the Northern Ears and Water bats in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to track the activities of the bats during the station.
Volunteers and staff of the UK National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with laptop detectors.
Analysis of the sound of recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed picture on the scale of the landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation advisor to the National Foundation of Scotland, expects the results to show which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management jobs, such as grassland creation, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Building construction and restoration tasks threaten the bats, as they affect the nests and can cause loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and light turbines also pose a risk, just like chemically-killed paper and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to place insects and obstacles in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the bats very seriously.
He has ten experts with appropriate training, who perform surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes rescues in a regular way.
Even the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to bats on the Three Estate farm, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The farm manager, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Three, we have a great area for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.
But we still know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow."
It stresses the importance of checking whether there are any hits before doing property maintenance tasks, since the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young women, which could result in the disappearance of a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, harass them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officer of the Scottish Rappened Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still need to learn a lot about bats and in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data on their population."
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the charges of rape against him are "false news" and has stated that people "wanted to become famous" because of his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
Portugal's foreman and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Majorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Presumably, he paid $375,000 in time for the incident not to be publicized, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a video of Instagram Live in which it was addressed to its 142 million followers hours after the accusations were made public, Ronaldo, aged 33, claimed that they were "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says the gold pilot's winner five times in the camera.
"They want to become famous thanks to my name.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to become famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything's in order," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers have already prepared the suit against Der Spiegel for the charges, which have been described as "inadmissible privacy suspicion information," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz has claimed that the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the gravity of the crime, which is probably one of the most flagrant infringements of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Las Vegas Palms hotel and casino.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where she was allegedly raped anally, according to reports filed in Clark County County Court, Nevada.
Majorga claims Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy," except for "1%".
The papers claim Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sex, but they were allowed.
Majorga also claims that he went to the police and took photographs of the injuries to the hospital, but later he accepted an agreement outside the courts because he was "for fear of reprisals" and worried about him "to be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to cancel the agreement, as she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to take a look at King Madrid coming from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he was looking for Juve, the Italian giant, in a 100 million euro operation.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "would always repent" of losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "always regret it," if you lost the state of world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "concerning" that the Toyota base in the United Kingdom has stated to the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the European Union without any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of border delays in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis models of Toyota, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My point of view is that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade will work with other EU countries has aroused the fears of other car manufacturers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the Brexit production chain without agreement.
Toyota's production line is done on a "just in time" basis, with pieces reaching every 37 minutes of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the European Union for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without agreeing on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector believes could generate delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day on the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be stopped as a consequence.
Clark claims that Theresa May’s Chequer Plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
"We need to come to an agreement, we want to get the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The tests not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains."
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long production would stop, but in the long run, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could cause the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsovavalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the United Union on the floor, has stated that members are beginning to be very concerned about the situation: "By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never return."
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again.
Donald Trump's long-awaited meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "putting off a week" while continuing the struggle over the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, in White House statements on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Russia and aid to Trump and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fired the deputy Attorney General and put Mueller's independence at risk, he's been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking a microphone to record talks with Trump and also the possibility of filing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House in rumors he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump has stated that he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee to which Kavanaugh was testified and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation into the FBI's charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote of the whole Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be one more week for all matters with the supreme court.
But we'll see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might refute this statement: Sanders has not held an information session of the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he didn't like the fanfare of television journalists, although he said, "I won't deny they're bragging."
Next, he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president has more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting any sources: "We have consulted this data."
Sanders has stated that the briefings will continue to take place, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's far infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and they'll replace the briefings when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press wheels with dignitaries on official visit.
Individual press wheels are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal appearance and, at some point, strange in front of the journalists gathered.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service for fear of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after leaving the United Kingdom of the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the cost of state residence applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and everything seems to be geared towards the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations for a possible stage without agreement.
I know it's convulsive time for all of you.
I wanted to reiterate now that I deeply appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, bring a valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service, while benefiting the patients and communities we deal with.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, re-direction of the Tennessee State Tigers, has undergone an emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury on Saturday in the defeat of 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Coach at Tennessee State, Rod Reed, reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before the middle part.
"He came to the bandline and collapsed there," said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him on a bunker and taking him to do more testing.
A Tennessee State officer informed Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had gone out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there's still no information on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after fixing it from Illinois.
I had completed five placards on Saturday before I left the game, which makes a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The rise in the stamp tax will be recorded in those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The facility expects up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are expected to have a higher stamp tax on buying a property in the United Kingdom and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher yields.
The rise in the stamp tax will be recorded in those people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; this money will be used for government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The overload, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second residences and real estate speculations, could be up to 3%.
The IRS expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are non-British residents, increasing prices and making it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" following the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has requested a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people get their first home.
He accused large constructions of keeping the prices of the properties high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel the quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain's "destroy real estate".
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as controls on rent and termination of "no blame" evictions.
He also wants to give more power to the assemblies to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work, and create a life here.
However, it can't be right that it's as easy for people who don't live in the UK, as well as for companies with them abroad, to buy housing compared to British people who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home on property is too distant and the indignity of the homeless makes everything even more real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has claimed that his "maximum ambition" is to be the coach in Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scots accepted the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which currently occupies the third position in the League One, at three points of the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was summoned to support once and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
"But I grew up seeing a lot playing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was little and it's always something that makes me back in time.
This opportunity will come only if I succeed in training clubs, but."
Ross' predecessors in the Sunderland coach include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Coach Alloa Athletic says he doesn't feel the pressure to be next on a list of names consecrated on such a large team, after having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For now, my criteria for measuring my success will be if I can get this team back to the Premier League.
With the club's structure and facilities, it's obvious that its place is the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy getting there, but I'd just consider that I've been successful here if I can get the club back."
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts Technical Body.
Helped Alloa to avoid descent into the third category and turned St Mirren into fighting for salvation in Championship champions the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a decisive moment," he remembered about accepting the charge on the Alloa.
"I had always believed that training was what was given me best, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did it well, I got out reasonably and enjoyed quite good times.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through things like stress and work pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable thing I've ever felt since I was an adult."

The perfect time for a look is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heat wave has triggered consumption in Britain's tough bars, but has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains have increased by 2.7 per cent in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, from CGA's financial advice, the company that has collected the data, says: "Continual hours of sunshine and England's participation in the World Cup, which has widened beyond expected, have led in July to a pattern similar to that of June, with the 2.8% increase in bars, except in restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption in June restaurants has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by drinking, have achieved the best results, while eating in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered with the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we consulted, drinks sales increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, from the Oci and Hotelers' RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we see since the end of April.
The time and impact of large social or sports events continue to be the main factors related to sales of the external oci market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decline in sales by 4.8% annually would be especially detrimental, rather than continuing pressure on costs.
This long and warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-service trades and time will tell if the most moderate temperatures we had in August will provide this much needed breath."
The total increase in the sales of bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, has been 2.7% in July, as it indicates the slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The sales indicator of The Coffer Peach Tracker for restaurants, bars and taverns in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operator groups, with a combined loss of over 9 million pounds and is the industry's established reference point.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide parents and teachers, according to data from a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students indicated an increase on the "false Insta" pages.
News has raised fears about sexual content publication
20% of students say they have a "principal" account that shows parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, believe social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students indicated a rapid increase in the "mistakes of Insta" accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news has raised fears about sexual content publication.
About 20% of students say they have a "principal" net account that shows their parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager in which she urged others to "violate me."
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Independent School Directors (HMC), has revealed that 40% of adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, half of which have admitted that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "views of athletes" in the directive of the Scottish athletic federation
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish athletic federation directive at the annual general meeting of the organization.
Doyle is the country athlete and track with more Scottish medals, and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who guide the sport to benefit from his dilated international experience in the last decade.
"Eilydh has respect for the community of Scottish athletics, the United Kingdom and the world, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm very eager to act as an athlete's voice, and I hope to be able to grow the sport and contribute to Scotland."
The American, who won the gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, was among four Olympic golds and is currently the usual BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I can recover or how much.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today it's going to do agility exercises!
Thank you for the cheering messages!"
An announcement of tyrellates comparing mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A tyrallet company has divided the opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares suckling mothers with cows who flock.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "first silent shot that can be carried from the world", the consumer technology company Elvie has issued an advertisement inspired by a musical video of joke to show the freedom that the new shooter gives to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a granary full of farts and cows at the rhythm of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I do myself, but you won't see a tail" and, "If you hadn't noticed, they're not brats, but my breasts."
The tour goes on, "Bombing, pumping, feeding babies, pumping, pumping, handcuffing girls."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a mix of reactions from the person who saw it, many of whom say it shows the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after birth," wrote one person.
Elvie is discreetly hiding in a lactation bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "Remarkably traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to announce a t-shirt to mothers that will keep their babies?"
Another user added, "It's an out of place ad."
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that finding the song was "fun."
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Bombing for the gun made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but it has to be taken like it is.
It's a great product," one user wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who pump with tyrannicals (usually at their place of work or at the toilet and feel like cows.
It's not an ad that you praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've all danced with the gunpocket discreetly to the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when they use the gun.
However, the Elvie Shooter is completely silent, has no cable or tube and fits discreetly into a lactation bra, giving women more freedom to move, hold babies and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Mother's early childhood partner and developer, said: "Elvie's handgun is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative campaign.
When we drew parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a gun is used and the challenges that it is to do, while we demonstrated, entertainingly and didactically, the incredible feeling of freedom offered by the new gun.
It's not the first time Elvie's shooter's on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the bridge for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children emigrants detained has increased even though monthly entries across the border have almost remained stable, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration have made it difficult for children to defend themselves.
Traditionally, most of the patrons were undocumented immigrants, who were afraid to put their chance to stay in the country if they decided to take a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the possible patrons and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs control officer, testified in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to pick up unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no previous criminal record.
"About 80 percent of the people who have stayed or lived in the home of a person who has received them are illegally in the country, and a large majority of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to pursue these people," Albence declared.
To prosecute the children more quickly, officers have introduced new rules that require some to be brought to court within a month after being held, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, instead of face-to-face, to defend their case in order to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The more children spend time in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent ramps or escape attempts, according to the workers and reports he has given to the system in recent months.
Advocates claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, because of its size, signs indicating that a child is suffering will be ignored.
They added that moving the children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that they already suffer.
Syria urges the "occupational forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Muallem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has lasted eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, has stated that foreign forces were in Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly."
"You must retire immediately and unconditionally," he said at the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the "war of terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 troops on the land of a war-affected country.
On the subject of refugees, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for their return and has blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational grounds" that make refugees want to stay away from them.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for reconstruction for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last major rebel bastion, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue the political meetings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has noted that the agreement has "clear terms" and has expressed the hope that military action will confront the jihadists, which include fighters of the Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will be "punished".
Staffan de Mistura, UN envoy, expects to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee formed by members of the government and the opposition to begin to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the elections again in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators probably expect, scandals and the removal process end with his presidency prematurely.
Which would, of course, be "the end of a most dramatic presidency in history."
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in maximum-hour audiences has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in high-level audiences, from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has led the audiences on cable television with up to 3.5 million viewers on major night information.
"People have been hit because they don't understand," says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series "Designed Survivor," about a cabinet decree that becomes president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a former comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he'd vote Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He answered me that because he made him laugh," said Scovell.
There's a point of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike TV shows, the script coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families could meet and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you're at six o'clock to see a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of sources "for private use" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 extrusion leather jacket ("a thick piece of clothing like his pride," headlined the Washington Post) and the consequences of the horrifying descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I won't see Super Mario again.
"Part of what seems to be part of a telereality program is that every night it gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about changes in characters and scripting tours of Trump's program (to fight with NFL, rent Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss any episodes because you're staying behind.

He couldn't get away with it, not with Brett Kavanaugh, about to face the Senate judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we were doing those crazy shows then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss said.
"I thought it would be kind of a joke, but it seems they were right."

Foreign money floods the middle-legislature election races in the House of Representatives' most adjusted elections
It is no surprise that there is a flood of cash in the 17th District of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of the Congressional Districts that has caused two current members to compete in the same square.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburg involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who obtained the square in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favour of the republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Congress Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was named after Pennsylvania after a victory set in a very successful special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
Republicans have been in charge for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States impose sanctions on Salvador for its support in China, but withdraw them
Diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners threw out the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for the "recent decisions on not acknowledging Taiwan," declared Heather Nauert, spokesperson for the department this month.
However, it was only contemplated the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received US aid in 2017 of 140 million dollars, according to estimates, for drug trafficking, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high numbers of deaths due to murder and unemployment.
As the internal meetings took place, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward to prevent emigrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior government officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, which ended effectively with any possibility of sanctions for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration gives it, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys discreetly returned to their charge of Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officers, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations since the anonymous.
An external analyst, close to the administration, and also since the anonymity, corroborated the statements.
Study history
The next event in the event could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there are numerous evidences in public records.
As far as it's known, Mueller also investigates whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could be held accountable to the organization, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even before a jury of party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's fall, nor any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to take a coup against Hitler only if the Western bloc had resisted him and supported the Checoslovacs in Munich.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over points of inflection like this and accelerates or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is currently facing a number of inflection points.
What if Trump sacked Rod Rosenstein, the deputy Attorney General, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with water in his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested recording the president secretly and speculated that he was inappropriate for the position.
Rosenstein claims the Times information isn't accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation that the FBI has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witnesses?
And especially are we going to vote in the middle of the legislature for a Congress that will make Trump responsible for it?
If we don't get through these trials, democracy will begin to be in danger.
But I think we're not going to fail, because I've learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to light Sabbath candles at that table with swastika.
With this luggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimist in front of the anti-Vienna Rapid Party
The Rangers receives the Vienna Rapid Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive four in the real Vila-Real camp this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify for the G Group of the League Europe.
A knee injury prevented half-fielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until 4-2 against the Real Village, but he believes Rangers can use this as a trampoline for great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because the Real Village is a good team," said the player, 31 years old.
"We played the party believing that we could get a valuable result and we got out with a point.
Maybe we could've pulled something else out at the end, but, in general, the empathy was probably a fair result.
They were better at the first part, but we were better at them than they were at the second.
On Thursday, it's another great European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it's going to be a hard game because they made a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we'll do it all and we'll get a good result with the support of the hobby.
Last year it was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes in the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team is fine and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can give it all up, leave behind last season and succeed."
Women lose sleep from fear of retirement savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it to the family.
Approximately half of national surveys claim that they have talked to their partner about the long-term cost of attention.
Only 10 percent of the polls say she talked to the kids about it.
"People want someone to look after them, but they don't dare to think about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
We need to get started here.
Talk to your mate and children about serving Jehovah. You cannot prepare your family for any lack of communication with your wishes.
He works with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to get attention, since these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
It includes your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your funding options for your long-term care may include a long-term long-term long-term health insurance policy, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your own expenses or insurance with your own resources, if you have the money you need to do it.

Specify these details in a plan written to be ready.
Finance is not the only factor that must be determined, but also which doctors to deal with," Martin said.

Man shot several times with a compressed air gun at Ilfracombe
A man has received several shots from a compressed air gun while he was returning home after leaving at night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The officers described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 a.m. (in the British summer hours) as a "random act."
The victim hasn't seen his attacker.
His life is not in danger from the wounded and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died from a massive earthquake and tsunami that rocked the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Since the communications are cut, the relief units have not been able to obtain information about Donggala's regency, an area north of Palu nearest the epicenter of magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important data on Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located at the extreme of a narrow bay on the west coast of Celebes Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th birthday at the time of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region below a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the Central Celebes province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali on the coast of the other extreme of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in western Donggala that killed new people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific firebelt, and earthquakes are often occurring there.
The main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are listed below:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on Nias Island on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that devastated the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 - magnitude earthquake jolted a pop area of the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 - magnitude earthquake jolted one of the islands of Mentawai on the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that devastated dozens of people and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck the regiment of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
Although no tsunami occurred this time, over 100 people were killed.
2018: A series of major earthquakes took place on the Indonesian island tourism in Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and arrest resistance, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a known person tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he pulled his phone.
Palin is detained at the Mat-Su interim detention centre, where he is held with a bond with no guarantee of $500, according to KTU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he declared himself "not guilty, surely" when he was asked how he declared himself, according to this chain.
Palin faces three class A missing persons, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
It is also accused of a lack of class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin have been registered.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to notify of the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic aggression, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in connection with the incident.
Her husband declared that he had punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for associating her child's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake shook the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks don't work and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulating at the time of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived on the coast.
Federal prosecutors are calling for an exceptional death penalty for a suspect in the New York terrorist attack
The federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack who killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on West Side Highway, Lower Manhattan and hit riders and cyclists during his trip in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" caused serious personal injuries, according to the notice of intent to apply for the death penalty presented in the Southern District of New York.
Both crimes could be a death penalty, according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal juror attacked Saipov with an indictment of 22 wrongs including eight charges of murder for organized crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in cases of mafia, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required a "significant planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, native to Uzbekistan, did not show repentance in the days and months after the attack.
The police explained that he told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also requested that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room.
He was found not guilty of the accusation of 22 wrongs.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public federal defenders, claimed that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We consider that the decision to apply for the death penalty, rather than accept a conviction and a life sentence without the possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Member of parliament of the Conservative Party states that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative party conference.
The former UKIP leader has stated that politicians must "feel pressure from Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own members suggested that he should lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MEP without charge Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage was Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when Conservatives in favour of the union have presented themselves in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers commitment plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, Union supporters and the EU.
The Allies insist that they will be able to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative answers and pressure the Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to break the Chequers engagement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he'd been in charge, we'd be out by now,' he said.
The member of the Wellingborough parliament added, "I will defend Brexit, but we have to break the Chequers compromise."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British population has changed their minds and wants to stay is totally false."
Brexit Conservative Partywoman Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said to reporters: "I only tell you, Prime Minister, to listen to people."
"Chequers' commitment is unpopular between the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who come out and get us to win an election.
Quit the Chequers engagement and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added, "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said the rally politicians must feel pressure if they want to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"That, now, is a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and today we're here to tell them we won't allow it."
In a message to the excited crowd, he added, "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure."
"We are mobilizing the popular troops in this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the union marched to Birmingham before holding a two - hour rally in the center of the city.
A small number of activists waved banners over the Conservatives against Brexit after the band was launched this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis was ridiculed by Conservatives for the security problems they experienced with an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Agreement plus, for the friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no choice for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to examine the possibility of becoming a presidential candidate.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to examine the possibility of becoming a presidential candidate after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, usual critic of President Donald Trump, is presenting himself for his re-election in November against the state representative of GOP Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It's been the center of speculation about Trump's possibility of raising in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents in the open assembly format since Trump took over.
An assistant asked him if he was planning on running as a presidential candidate.
Warren said it's time for "women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome."
A person arrested for death from Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge police, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for shooting the LSU Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the ET press conference at 11:00.
They posted a video of the shooting Friday and requested collaboration to identify the man on the film.
Sims, aged 20, was shot and died near Southern University campus in the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims got shot in the head that eventually killed him," said police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday in the media for 247 sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got shot from Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody in the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 beginnings during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets the title of the world after the team's orders give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas stood in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton while defending his position on the first two occasions and inviting Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel went into boxes before and let Hamilton run with traffic to the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop at the boxings and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after certain wheeled action that caused the Ferrari pilot to abandon the free inner part at the risk of staying out after a double movement to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first round he was in the seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then he continued in a good position, keeping his wheels in running order to save time, moving to Kimi Raikkonen, and moving to fourth position.
Finally he entered the boxes at round 44, but he couldn't increase the pace the next eight times and Raikkonen was placed in fourth position.
It's a hard day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real lord who was told to let me pass.
The team did a great job of having an u-dos," Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday to insist that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's witness in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate proved that people are "sick, cruel and lying."
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's going on in the Senate in the last days, when you see the anger, when you see people angry, mean, cruel and lying," he said.
"When you look at the communications and the leaks and say, "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document? "Hey, what?
No, no.
I didn't leak it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't filter it," he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the statements against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leaking from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to be confidential and I kept it confidential, just as he asked me."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the meeting on Saturday night, "You know what, his body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the High Court candidate, accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see evil, cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to strike for power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat of the Elite on Friday against the Belfast Giants, as they won the game back 5 to 3 on Dundee Saturday.
The Giants quickly gained an advantage of two goals thanks to the completions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie went up the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard equaled the Dundee, then two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen assured his victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the elite league for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won the Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's assistance, four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this turbulent initial period, Sullivan re-allocated the home team to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the advantage of Giants in the first pause when he achieved the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to their level with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the match at the end of the second part and guaranteed the victory of his team with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
An air controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake plane
An air controller from Indonesia has become a hero after dying to make sure that a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake shook the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There's a lot of replicas going on in the area and there's a lot of people trapped in the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Grando refused to leave his place at the tremendous airport control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Flight Batik 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take the flight.
Then he left the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died later at the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Siriat, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We set up a Balykpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"That broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster relief agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that have not been accessed," said the representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, devastated Palu, who will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial planes are carrying help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the little ones have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explained to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works against clocks to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
You're ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Aviation Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after the accident at the lake
The airline operating a flight that is going to crash into a Pacific lake in Micronesia now says a man is missing, although they previously said that the 47 passengers and the crew had safely evacuated the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday evening, they had not found a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and the crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said on Saturday there were still six passengers at the hospital and they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane tied to the lake because the runway was short.
Some witnesses think the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
"That was extremely positive," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to walk with water through the waist to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and began to shout, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors who were working nearby to improve a dock also helped in rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected persons to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a chronology of the night that burned alive a woman
The prosecutor concluded the case on Saturday in the revision of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness to the intelligence analysis field.
He described to the jury how he used mobile phone records to build the defendant's 29-year-old movements, Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, contradicting his earlier statements, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers the moment he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that the day was not in the city.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, since his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated it was only a week ago that they knew each other.
Rowlett said that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis suppressed text messages, calls and contact information from Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense plans to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to pass the trial on the same day.

They want to go back to their roots and put the hip-hop back in fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom by the hands of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY Morning demands a couple for farewell after a "racist" message
A New York nurse reported a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after they received a text message from the mother who protested because she was "another black person."
The couple denies that they're racist and compare the demand with an "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed dismay that the new nursemaid, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day of 2016.
"Nooooooooo some other black person," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her pifia, a "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nurse that she had fired, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she expected a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her working day and was later sent home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice is demanding compensation for the couple's dismissal and seeks compensation of approximately $350 a day for the six-month residence work for which he had been hired, although there was no contract.
"I want to show you that you can't do things like that," he explained in the Post Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the statements that they were racist by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent him something I didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist people," said the husband, Joel Plasco, at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the lawsuit to a "extortion," said that his wife had two months left to have a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue such a thing?
It's not a very kind attitude," added the investor banker.
The legal case is still unresolved and the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media and condemn their behaviour and logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bone, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in connection with the letter, "It's hard to put herself in someone's place who's read it for the first time before his publication.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before having the inspiration to write the children's book about a small teddy bear, was optimistic about the rejection of the book, also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agreed," after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and notes that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous man," he said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was practically as when your son gets something: you take pride, even if it's not your business.
I think he considered Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always recognized Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her by phone
On landing, they took his daughter in a hurry to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save his life.
"Nothing called frequently to say it was very serious and they didn't expect it to get over it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
"Then I rang a call from Nad and told me he would die in the next two minutes and say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so, pretty.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs they had given him so that his body would continue beating were consuming and coming out of his system.
He had died before he was planned and so it all went off.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by relatives and more people.
I had to keep my manners straight."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience that was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"He had his head down and tears kept falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad overwhelming.
The feeling I needed my love and understanding.
I know I loved her a lot."
Women of grief hang cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, he was killed.
"I don't want any father or mother to hear what I must hear every day," she said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, residing in Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said their smile could light up any room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "because people know there are people who can come to, who can hear, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"Never said he wasn't well or that he was depressed or anything like it," she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we observed a change of attitude.
He touched deep on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts and he didn't look them in the eyes or anything."
He said his death would be a great trauma to them, but they must work it out, "Open a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future stands by a thread as the FBI initiates an investigation
"I thought if we could get something like what he asked for -- an investigation with a limited time -- we could get a certain unit," said Mr. Flake on Saturday.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reticence has to do with the moment.
If, as expected, Republicans don't get good results, they'll be weak enough to get the man who wants to be elected to the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been taking the phone to call the senators and pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as he was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI believes his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where currently there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to undo the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean deserters "cau" with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of South Unity said there were 1,127 deserts last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the rising prices of human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
Usually, most deserters in the North are offered citizenship in South Korea.
Sources in Seoul claim that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized area (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the illegal migrant deserters instead of refugees and often returns them by force.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still at war, has improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the ongoing negotiations on nuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to achieve a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves unilaterally," said Mr. Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical" and is not fit to work in the High Court.
The leader of the minority of the Nancy Pelosi House said that the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh High Court is a "historical" and that his temperament is unable to work in the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments at a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted this way, they would have told her that it's an "historical," Pelosi said in connection with her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Judicial Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied the charges of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and missing words as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Committee's Democrats and said that the charges against him were "a grotesque and coordinated murder of a character" organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s witness showed that he could not work in the High Court, since he showed prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when he was asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if it's confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you're not only able to be in the High Court, but also in the court where you are now," Pelosi remarked.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge at the Columbia District Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, since she is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he asked questions as to whether certain decisions of the High Court would be overturned.
"It's no time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the court and hope it looks wonderful to us," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justified diatratra: months and years of plenty of rage and can't take it off without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon, do you?"
He continued... "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me she was also crying when she was angry, but who developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, to tell the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because, basically, they're misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with most men, where I once ended up crying with an unspeakable rage, is that of a bigger woman (a colder directive that had always frightened me a little bit) who grabbed me from the neck and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy, because they'll have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democrat in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital adventure on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the career, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought that there was no reason not to explore the idea of herself as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a well-meditated decision," he said as he laughed 30 years later.
"There were already seven other career candidates and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone said, "Blancane and the seven dwarfs."
Since he was late for the campaign, he was late for his fundraising, so he promised he would not enter the race unless he received $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, were only willing to give 250 to her.
"Do you think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (thanks to the people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and seeking voters instead of doing so to the delegates, and anger, and sexism) that he became speechless.
"You might have thought you had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the reaction of the press.
"You might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking: What will they put in my grave?
"Will you cry?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing · Global Voices
The initial rescues of the US-China trade war were shocking and, although the war does not seem to have to end soon, countries can benefit Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year, when he imposed taxes on China's major exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most significant climbing took place this week, with new spiders that affect products worth $200 billion, these spiders impose a tax on half of all the goods arriving in the United States from China.
Beijing has counter-attacked every time in the same way and has recently raised spiders from five to ten percent to $60 billion in American goods.
China has committed itself to replicating the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will soon go back.
Making Washington back involves giving in to some demands, but leaning publicly in front of the U.S. would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the United States could benefit China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that started a fall in any of these countries is far more dangerous than the witnesses had planned," says Abigail Grace, Asian-centered research associate at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is "prepared" for refugees to return, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people in the country who need help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime is grateful for any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or help from countries that funded the insurgency.
The selection of Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The selection of Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup to defeat the US selection with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European selection won the crown again when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, shot the exit into the water at hole 3 16, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his series and became one of the four players who achieved 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was separated with a 5&4 by the less qualified player of the European Thorbjorn Olesen selection from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost two and one with Ian Poulter from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 points of career.
"I don't need to cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a rough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so glad I got my drink back.
The team is the most important... and I'm glad I was able to help," said Garcia excitedly after the European victory.
Pass the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legend of American golf Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost the four matches he had in France and now has a career record at the Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players ever, with 14 big titles won and just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they fought.
This morning there was a moment when we pressed the European selection.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
There's something to take off your hat.
They have defeated us."
