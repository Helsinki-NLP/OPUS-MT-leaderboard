Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway, spend 26 hours there and be the fourth American president of history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded to him, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The chief of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a busy program.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who selected him in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's planning then provides for an interview with the King of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will know its summum in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth President of the United States to receive it, but only the third who will be awarded the prize in the Committee itself.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan during the award.
The president does not want to avoid this subject because he is aware that he receives this prize by being a president who is leading a war in two countries at present.
He strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million Euros).
It intends to donate to charitable works, but it has not yet specifically decided which ones.
His programme will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at the beginning.
For example, he mentioned the feeling of not fully meriting it.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as he announced, it would be an "invitation to act" for him.
A defender of nature accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police charged the president of the Litoměřice Nature Protectors Society with blackmail.
Several times last year he appealed for several construction construction site procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesman of the Litoměřice police.
The president of the Litoměřice Nature Protector Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and risks up to three years' imprisonment.
Waste sorting bins are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their packagings of drinks, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on bennas of sorting at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take several minutes before finding the right benes.
I don't mean we wouldn't pick up the waste at all in Brno.
But I feel that our city councillors, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but above all because of the number of benes dedicated to these wastes.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle into the city center?
It's a whole science, which mainly requires time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found for the moment is the place of Moravia in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't want me, but it seems to me to be so little.
Not to mention the fact that in other neighborhoods of the city it's not a sense of security either.
So to finish, many of my friends don't sort their waste.
Per paresse.
It makes them a trot to get to the bennas.
I'm not surprised on their part.
I myself, after a party, proposed to drop a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't notice any colour bandages on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place by going to take the tram.
That said, waste was overflowing.
It is after all the centre of Brno, who is supposed to represent the city best, isn't it?!
It is likely that ecology and a so-called aestheticism are not too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy in the city a place in the first league of hockey that shames the city all over the country, instead of buying some extra bandages and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to comfort my impression with official statistics after dragging a moment on the internet.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget has removed from its silvery pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or civil servants, there may be a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for the interests of the State's debt or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will borrow for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just to restore the problems later, to mine the land," Janota said.
It should be noted that interest on borrowed money is increasing and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The State does not really have the choice to know where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social aid or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those that the left has now increased: the firefighters, the teachers, the farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and must not fear for their retirement or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater indebtedness of the state - next year there will therefore not be a shortage of 163 billion in cashiers, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will grow more rapidly and with it, interest-related spending.
The state will need money to restore it and it will no longer be enough to increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be a shortage of five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly already decided and initiated sections, which are not possible to change projects to reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty large construction sites, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to the caution of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very appropriately - it will grow in the dividends of ČEZ (Electric Power Provider and Distributor), which the State has in most respects and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not a bottomless well in any case.
Last year, it was 18 billion that were sailed from ČEZ to budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the elimination of ecological damage, to complete retirement accounts, or to serve as a reserve for the retirement reform that is being prepared.
In addition, this suggestion increases the real budget deficit by 5.7 percent of GNP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the carnival of transfers.
The budget for various damages to victims of communism and crime, even housing savings, has declined by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, Janota says.
The Minister will then have to save on the side of the department or, at the worst, touch on the government's budget reserve.
There is also a hundred million missing from the two-billion-dollar draft State Fund, which must be able to monitor online the expenditure of each administration.
The first step will begin in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find any money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans consider a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
Projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just one button and you move from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the U.S. VMware company, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can switch between them, you can differentiate them in staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones does not fall within the scope of fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is growing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to current devices 2012.
The shortage of mountain snow worries hoteliers
Desert runways are no problem only for rebound operators.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski trips in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to identify free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and the New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Netizens go through the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to make a reservation for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year's Dreams at Špindlerýv Mlýn, you better not be too hesitant to book.
If the economy is given priority and the quality of the accommodation comes only later, then one can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler hoteliers are currently only offering one-week stays for the New Year.
I think they'll try to place them again, but they'll give up and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The Vrchlabí Ingtours tourism agency also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The Christmas week is of greatest interest to us for the moment, it is not completely sold.
It's still free, let's say, half the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared some less expensive last minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours Petr Schiefert's director.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free seats.
The fourteen first days of February are just as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter on the mountain without snow.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," says Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places for the New Year as well as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the holidays of January of the Polish and February is also well sold," reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The hotel Omnia near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also complete at 90 percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in Jánské Lázně's most recent hotel.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already sixty percent of occupation at present.
February is a little weaker for the moment but as the snow falls, the interest for the stays in the Krkonoše will certainly still grow, said the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel owners of the Krkonoše, however, should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there are precipitations, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But later on, time should warm up, please inform Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It becomes even comical, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president of the wise reputation, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he himself considered simple.
When he ended up letting his doctrine sweat so badly expected, it turned out that he had copied it to carbon paper since the Iraqi Bush scenario three years ago.
Not happy to use in the text itself several times the expression "like in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is more, to use the title of the Bush speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements into an Iraq consumed by civil war as "irresponsible and catastrophic decision in its consequences."
However, the following months showed that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only possible and possible success to such an extent that the newspapers at present do not speak of Iraq at all.
This has not improved Bush's reputation, it says, objectively speaking, he left his successor a far more favorable final situation than could be expected.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will reproduce
It was again the campaign commanders who requested an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habit of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, he cheated at least the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He succeeded in extirpating the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though it had an original 10,000.
What brings the most problems in Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to remove the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process within three years. All Obama's doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that a half increase will bring the same fruits as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out by the exact opposite - no one can be relied on and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing their day-to-day leadership according to their arrangements.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will only remain powder in the eyes behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity about the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "ready to act" state, which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy makes his volunteerism perplexed.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent into the tumult of the war in view of their "soon return to the house" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, since the Taliban will regard it as the indirect acknowledgement of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their constituents how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of Iran-related events.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and strengthened sanctions have no effect on Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of solving the problem through the use of military force.
For example, it will be necessary to answer when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of Afghanistan's troops.
However, each solution of this type will result in a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only ruse for Obama is that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to plan on a new strategy, in case it would turn out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank leaders will no longer receive cash premiums
High-ranking employees from the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company has announced this to respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell before five years.
The actions may be withdrawn from the leaders if they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link pay with long-term performances at Wall Street.
I assume Wall Street is well aware of the overall meaning to be taken, said the former Investment Banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank became the target of criticism after putting aside almost $17 billion for premiums over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total premiums will likely exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the strong premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political subject in many countries.
Great Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to allocate a single tax of fifty percent of bankers' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics
These are five women, a record number, who received today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prizes in the technical disciplines and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize for Medicine for research in chromosomes.
The prize of chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize for Economics, American Elinor Ostrom and his fellow countryman Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award has now been awarded to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of fiber optics and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary reward.
It reaches 10 million Swedish krona in each category. (about 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward with each other.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the controversial nature of his reward, since it was only at the beginning of his course and that he was also the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the discharge of his policy he added that in some situations war is essential for obtaining peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Château
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who will impose his stay in government due to his disagreement with the State budget for the coming year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday appointment.
Klaus also criticised the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which further exacerbates the public finances crisis.
Presidential spokesperson Radim Ochvat informed of the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his office Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation to be submitted for signature by Klaus, it is a deficit of 163 billion kroons that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the House of Deputies validated the left-wing proposals on money transfers Wednesday and increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government opposed the proposals of the Social Democrats that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement was created between the left, the government, Klaus and the right, on the other hand, which called into question the future of Fischer's cabinet that had been formed by agreement between the OSS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by Members, removes the package of savings measures passed by the Fischer government and that it must stem the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but is not obliged to do so, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs that policies have long ignored the "serious problem" of the "irrecontroversial deficiency" of public finances.
In his view, there is now no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could improve, if it could build on a consensus of the wider political parties, according to the president.
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget is sneezing and that the government should call into question its subsequent existence.
The vice-president of the ODS Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "drastic truths".
The head of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is shocking and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, ČSSD has shown success in ratifying the State budget for the coming year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood Invictus film - Invaincu will expose a lot of things to the world about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American actor rewarded for the Oscars, embodys Nelson Mandela's life film, untiringly fighting against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was a 90-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally."
The seventy-twelve actor who has been rewarded with a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby drama in the middle of the box has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery himself became a slave, a fictitious president of the USA, even God himself in the movie Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and important for so many people as Mandela is.
The former South African State man was imprisoned 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invincuous and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela's joint efforts and of the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela recently elected knows that his country remains and is still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people with sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the outsiders at the world level.
The South African team will eventually make progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role so as to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind him before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I held your hand, I recovered your energy, it passed on and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try and become someone else.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor stated that he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look a lot bigger in the movie'.
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the cheer of the director Eastwood has received positive opinions and even talks of ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety newspaper summarized his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very good film."
In film reviews on the Rottentomatoes.com site, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The mystery of aura in Norway is solved: Russians tested a rocket
There was a strange phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognized only yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket near the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the "Bulava" type missile which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army gradually became the nightmare of the Russian Generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she was damaged in mid-flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "the missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was carried out at the beginning normally.
It's only at the end of the flight that there were again damage to the equipment.
It's clearly the third-floor rocket engine that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the Dmitrij Donskij nuclear submarine that was sailing under the White Sea surface.
This type of missile can be precisely fired from a moving and immersed vessel
This is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object has probably been by a defective "Bulava".
Besides, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that this was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak of failure.
The first two floors of the rocket survived and the damage affected only the third.
In the previous cases, engines had failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches have been conducted without crutches, the Department of Defence's management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of nearly fifty percent thus fills the generals with optimism and they always claim that one day "Bulava" will fly smoothly and even carry ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with the Moscow CSKA at 51 years of age.
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again present himself in a professional game at 51 years of age.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will lend hand-hold to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably enter already during the Friday match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is now the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury we need another defender urgently.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details on the form, says the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest professional Russian hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and got 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union, he scored gold twice at the World Olympics, seven World Champions, he won Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also received tributes in NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member since 2001 of the Temple of the fame of hockey.
Hyundai listened to the unions and cancelled all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that trade unions have declared an emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesperson Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai plant confirmed it.
However, management still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked this year.
We can't give up our production plan, it's essential, that's why volunteer overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19 knowing there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The site Sedmička.cz indicated that the company offered a 400 Czech crown bonus to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be assigned a posteriori for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for additional hours.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can place a replacement leave on December 28th and thus extend their end-of-year holiday Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and their lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and claims of trade unions as employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, employees at the car factory were forced to work almost daily two overtime in addition to their eight hours.
Trade unions intend to cancel the strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the trade unions must take place Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said Wednesday that they were ready to stop the strike if they agreed on their claims and signed a common document.
The situation in the factory ended last Wednesday when almost 400 employees spontaneously strike due to unceasing overtime.
They also protested against the bad conditions of wages and so-called bizutages.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work in addition to meet the requirements for car production.
When the strike was announced on Monday, trade unions also requested that workers who had ceased production should not be subject to any sanctions.
Trade unions ask the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a remuneration of 5,000 kroner (about €209) for these.
Nošovice's Hyundai car factory currently employs 2,000 people.
It started production in series last year in November.
It has manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "enduring" HIV viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the proliferation of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality in some cases takes over the fact that the combination does not act as intensively on the current variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
However, it is possible to radically prolong the life of the sick through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption results in a series of side effects.
In addition, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what is called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of the experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are a mixture of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of the researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their links to the proteins of the virus.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiple-walled cages are formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by HIV protease, there would be no mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus will also be stopped in the patient's body, explaining the researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of HIV protease substances has been tested in test samples and on its resistant variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarborans is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however, it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which current drugs are often ineffective.
Metacarbons, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations to consider further to develop effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína ▼ezáčová, director of the laboratory of structural biology of the organic chemistry and biochemistry institute and the institute of molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Debates around the budget.
The president of the SDO (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek called the budget ratified for the following year "difference" and, according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should challenge his existence.
The Prime Minister described the SDG's words as a drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
The spokesman for the ODS Petr Nečas stated that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer worked.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether the House of Deputies supports the minority who is concerned about combating the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about staying in office with the support of the left-wing parliament.
Nečas warned that the positions of the WSO and the social democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget Wednesday, but with proposals for amendments to 12 billion crowns included on the left.
The House increased the money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance to the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that a modified budget is a less bad option than an interim budget.
Disappointment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feelings of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to resign in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation might be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment on Monday with the Prime Minister following his visit to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering if he would remain in his duties.
His disappointment with the budget negotiations is the reason for this.
If Fischer decides to continue to address the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the ČSSD representatives, who imposed the changes in the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws that increase the deficit, such as those that affect health insurance, pensions, or reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDO are not in question.
This is the case of the Chief of the Fischer Government and the whole government.
Ministers appointed by the SDO did nothing harmful, Topolánek pointed out in a textual communiqué from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments claimed TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the amount of public finances deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he must not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I haven't thought about it and once it's on the agenda, then I'll devote myself to it, declared from the Chamber to journalists, Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected by the Democrats just in the government.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The SDO went back to the Prime Minister's request.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the SDO would probably have voted on Wednesday against the modified budget if it had not specifically asked the Democrats to allow the budget to be voted on.
We do not have the feeling that we are orphans, that we are not small children, did he react to the question of whether the SDO had not been reproached by the President of the Party in the Chamber or in the country when the budget was negotiated.
I did not notice that my vote would have been missing.
I already knew at the time when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a retaliation of the House and a destruction of all that was positive, Topolánek responded in person.
According to the new ČD schedules, there will be fewer trains for identical fares.
The Czech Railways will delete or limit from 13 December some less-charged express or regional trains and, on the contrary, strengthen some more trains.
Total transport coverage will fall on the day of entry into force of the new two-percent hours compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic rates and reduced tariffs.
For example, it is the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more links to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolin branch.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest drop in transport concerns the Hradec Kralové region by 8 percent, but Prague and its surroundings can be pleased with an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the circulation of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the biggest transformations, one can see the introduction of a new line from Milovice to Prague: for the time being Milovice inhabitants must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague Main Station (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will leave in two hours.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13.
This year's bill for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year in all four billion krona to settle visible losses, or the same amount as this year. Regional trains are commanded by the regions that will pay for them a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate to almost three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration has always been one year.
The railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not use a price increase in the vast majority of transport licences.
Changes will only affect one-day ČD Net tickets and eLiška discounted internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 krona.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the journey, while so far it was valid between cities in a region of choice and was at a single rate of 160 krona.
The Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, the children have been released
The rebels today kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some pupils from a primary school and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed it, but that it originally spoke only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
Hostage took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that approximately 19 rebels used hostages as human shields during a police leak.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first continued the raptors as a result of violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the governor's administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the southern Philippines was arrested following suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampathuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan line.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they have renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa is about everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in the American halls in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned apartheid fighter returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was assigned to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the halls, the returns of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, then in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is on the one hand preparing for the football world, and on the other, because the media are troubled by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination by the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations made to the main roles where Hollywood stars "pavant".
Morgan Freeman is, however, proud of the film, in his own words.
I've dreamed of this role for many years and I've been well prepared.
I have also met personally Nelson Mandela to be able - as they say - to recover from his energy, he indicated during the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if you can remember Mandela's personality and message through the movie.
This is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but this concerns every individual has added.
Wearing the jersey of the national rugby team
The film based on the history of the novel by British writer John Carlin is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave his creation to the people paint the South African human rights defender during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying during the film to collect two racial groups from a long-divided population, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995 he was dressed as the national jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won at the time.
To show itself on the grass in jersey, which is considered something sacred in South Africa, Mandela had been long ovationd fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by white populations.
Hopefully, the football championship will succeed in bringing people together again into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
However, South African whites are skeptical as they have recently been entrusted with an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship began on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of fiery crowns in the Louny region
A fire swallowed in the morning a transformer of Čeps company from the distribution center near the municipality of Výškov na Lunsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman for the Ústí firefighters, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally counted on letting the transformer consume, but they revised their opinions and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short-circuit of the transformer.
No one has been injured and according to Pavla Mandátova's spokesperson, the incident does not endanger the secure operation of the transmission package.
Damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure may be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyer will have to be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity Čeps has not known anything similar and that such incidents are isolated.
Electrical power supplies have not been interrupted, ČEZ's spokesperson for North Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova states, the operation of households, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire in the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transport sets to distribution sets and traces of lines of a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura will bring a defamation complaint against three ČSSD Prefects
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, is now filing a complaint for defamation against three Social Democrats Prefects.
And specifically against Michal Hašek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the Prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated it in Dvacet minute of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and claimed that we made the fine mouths, while we only made an offer for what they wished for themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So we only have to defend ourselves.
This is in exchange for slanders about the Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
He also indicated that there was evidence that no region had done in accordance with European law.
We are preparing for this a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura's complaint is a continuation of his media show, which serves as a free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I assume this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and misleading arguments about regional rail transport, Hašek says
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and that he would take it back after the New Year.
He stated that the campaign will focus on corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura started his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of approximately 150 billion kroner, without issuing tenders.
According to Jančura, such a way of acting is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought threats from a member of the ČSSD to Jančura.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of ČSSD, I don't know who this is, but I won't say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococces will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Votes are already being raised, saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococces are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists are also clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococces.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination has started in the past year or earlier, the following vaccinations will have to be paid for themselves.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year a quarter of the families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococces.
However, the parents paid 1600 kroner or more for one dose.
Immunization of young people requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year health insurance spends 300 to 450 000 crowns in vaccine doses.
However, they save on medical care that non-vaccinated children would require.
So far, the State had spent approximately 500,000 krona per year on all child vaccination.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota Package".
Pneumococces are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and poisoning of the blood.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age from pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries have introduced the refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible future vaccination obligation.
From January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský association indicated that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococces.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not truly satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have been able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that must now be followed said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We do not think about it for the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, physicians say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Paediatric Society, recognizes that vaccination based on volunteerata's flaws.
If all children were vaccinated, a decrease in vaccination renewals could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such an amount I understand the decision making the vaccination optional," said Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that from next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their babies vaccinated.
Vaccination against pneumococces is also disrupted because it is the first child vaccination that is funded by insurance and not by the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on potential future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
This, however, is linked to the concerns of the pediatric practitioners, who are concerned with the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have vaccines purchased by insurance, doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the State.
However, some Members feared that this would allow insurance to "deduct the amounts of health insurance".
For example, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to be reimbursed.
It is estimated that paediatricians will have to invest almost 40,000 krona per month in vaccines individually, which is a significant amount.
It'll be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Flight"
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (12 million GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 tables in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance of the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press (AP) press agency.
AP cited a police officer that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52 years old, claimed that he was authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the tables into a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied such authorization, said the agency.
Labour defends the increase in fiscal tax.
The Ministers defended the increase in tax and reductions in expenditure announced in the Pre-Budget report, despite criticisms of the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories stated that Alistair Darling "failed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by reporting his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted lightning by attacking low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, there is an increase of 0.5% of Social Insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public salaries from 2011.
The anger of Social Insurance
Trade unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession of which they are not responsible and warned that "problems" were announced.
The decline in Social Insurance - which will achieve about GBP 3 billion a year - has made the world of companies angry, because he believes it is a job tax while the objective should be a boost in the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than GBP 20,000 per year, will reach about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social insurance will increase further 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% banker bonus tax
The increase in the company's profits tax for small companies has been abandoned
Reduced taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person who wins 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a person who wins 40,000 GBP will lose 190 GBP, while a person who wins 10,000 GBP per year will gain 110 GBP more.
Ministers stated that their objective of halving the deficit before 2013 was "hard decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional taxes would weigh the first 5 percent of the employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, refuted an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in expenditure was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, and they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he said to the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that he was confident and that the growth of the economy would resume by the end of the year.
However, Labour forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed at which the deficit will be met - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he stated that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - while borrowing would be 3 billion GDP above the previous estimate.
"Opportunity Missing"'
The Conservatives who will launch a new advertising campaign to warn against the Labour debt crisis on Thursday stated that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, did they add, eluciating "cynically" difficult choices until after the elections - to be held in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary of the Ghost Cabinet Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" Important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from further reductions, contrary to the Tory proposals that would result in a faster and more significant reduction in the deficit.
But Lib Dems stated that the money collected through increased taxes and reduced spending would be used to support next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, claiming that the plans were "constructed on the wind".
Nick Robinson, BBC Political Editor, said that the schedule of announcements - such as the increase of inflation for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor to face charges of propaganda, with money simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is provided while people most need it and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Failure budget"
Although the ministers did not publish the details of expenditures beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that restrictions on public spending would only become felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Tax Studies (Institute des Etudes Fiscales) stated that the Chancellor's figures in the future involve substantial reductions in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only delayed," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, no matter what the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report.
The FBI investigates "the arrests of Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, announced the American Embassy in Pakistan, BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been reported missing from their home in the American state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said he was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and what conditions they are in," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, the FBI's spokesperson said the agency was aware of the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if it really is the students who are missing," she said.
Pakistan's Embassy in Washington stated that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
She said that the house was already under local police surveillance and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, refused to comment on the arrests, reported to the press agency Reuters, but stated that the United States should "co-operate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been taken away from their homes by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuses"
Over the past twenty years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the campaign of the June presidential elections.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran denied previous criticism regarding its non-compliance with human rights.
The authorities stated that such criticisms were politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens were sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors claim that at least five persons were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have tolerated no criticism, says our correspondent.
"Fashion Confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook Networks' and protesting against election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, always in blood and half conscious," said Amnesty.
In August, the candidate who lost the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that demonstrators detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 other people, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disturbances and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these agencies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested over the past three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to transform Bristol's site into a racetrack.
The eventPiste in the Park attracted 16 skiers and semi-professional snowboarders in competition for prices in kind.
At the top of Brandon Hill Park, a small trail preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view on the top of the runway was beautiful but it was quite intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city shining on the ground.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be abandoned at the fountain.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and worried the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr Bowen's latest book presents a much larger and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He has spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very good at listening to and reproducing the discussions between teachers and students on the issues most relevant to them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the city (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to Muslim youth?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to obtain a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their lawyers of a Sunni Purist Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today constitute a small part of the Muslims of Europe.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how much French politicians (and the so virulent intellectual elite of secularism) were really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than increasing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The Darkest View in the World
The Arctic changes faster and more dramaticly than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipments and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the great north, polar bears.
Knowledge of the history and complicated policies of whaling, he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting white bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then brave aspirant of 14 years who had only to fight the tip of his fly, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming next to their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous performance brought together 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally one millionth of the area necessary for an adult in freedom.The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to species survival.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit motorcycles use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of the science of the Arctic and a thrilling overview of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately relate the speed of change.
It's not necessary to try.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the underlying relief changes.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on the icebergs are of great help, but the biggest of the work is done by hard men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by pressurized saumâtre water nets.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn"
Marines, among the 6,000 people who have deposited crowns on the graves in Arlington
The first class of Angello Robinson, 19 years old, made a seven-hour bus trip to place a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
Within a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to gather on Saturday morning to deposit crowns on the graves of the veterans, in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen, make the journey every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the soldiers and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of the Arlington cemetery around the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for victims of United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation provided more than $150,000 to purchase and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a retired career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It's a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Emmitoufled in several layers of warm clothes, volunteers walked between the lawns and the wide hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as the new graves, said the organizers.
The mood was optimistic, while the children played and the couples held by their hand, carrying the fresh pine crowns on the grey graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Closely, he was planning silence on Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are imhumed.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals cried without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported themselves in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned to see the small black and white information cards, plunged into the wet ground for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears on her son's grave.
She was from Zanesfield, Ohio, and had taken eight hours to pick up on the grave of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget what we're free of... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I've disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American national who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, and affirmed the services of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to access the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, pose the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husband and she is followed and harassed by government officials.
Sanchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive awards, but the authorizations have always been refused.
The detention of an American national may increase tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that pursues a "soft" approach in order to improve relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times on Friday evening.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although it is new and desired consumer goods in a country or an employee's average salary is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day's salary.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often must communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press attaché to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a major mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- free distribution of mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas programme of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Even Cuba", referring to Raul Castro's installation as leader in the country to replace Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, when both countries begin to start a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities identified a supposed organization to prepare a plot to send five North Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this would lead to the dismantling of a large network of terrorist recruits who equitate the Internet in search of radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after having discovered them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube video website on the Internet.
Upon arrival in Pakistan, these men were led by Saifullah, who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, Al-Qaida's home and terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani Secret Service representative who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men were not involved in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north-east, and became a refuge from terrorism.
They were considered infiltrated agents.
For this reason they were rejected, said one representative of the authorities who expressed the condition of keeping the anonymity due to the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to obtain entry into the al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are interviewed by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists, in determining the people in whom they give their confidence.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, US secret services have had priority to infiltrate men into the al-Qaida network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of gatekeepers, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
Analysts suggest that potential U.S. recruits are closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert from the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups also need to pay more attention, in recent years in the choice of people they accept because American secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model than so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen demand "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked on the streets, here on Saturday, demanding more action on the climate by the negotiators working in the palace of the Bella Convention Center congresses of the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit up some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day when little has happened during the discussions on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists have walked from the city, displaying signs in English saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, declaring "The Earth says it has enough."
Several celebrities joined in the protests, including the Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travelling to Peru's mother's home country has opened his eyes to the heartbreaking problems facing the country due to the impact of the climate change that is already taking place."
That's one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march -- to put the word out and call on leaders from all over the world to make just, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to Bella Centre and said that she had arrested 19 people because they wore a mask or they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to Bella Centre and said that she had arrested 19 people because they wore a mask or they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to keep anonymity due to its involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing black masks and clothing lit several explosives near the main Copenhagen channel, which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk along the afternoon.
But it seems that demonstrators have failed to awaken the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's climate representative.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English: "In fact, that's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful from the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors in the area of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or hinder the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal tenacious differences between the races
Last week's federal report on mathematics results brought good news to Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District is still far behind the institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are in much greater progress in the past two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures from the National Assessment of Education Progress (National Assessment of the Progress of Education) are the persistent gap between the results of African Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in WashingtonD.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but those of their African-American classmates have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) is generally consistent, with only one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean white result was not included in the test results as the sample was not important enough.
The overall view of a six-year period is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between black and white in Grade 4 (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference only decreased to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the Group of Educational Institutions Director Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in the education of the District.
I am not jumping for joy for one or two winning points, said Kwame R. Brown (Democratic relative), Member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown stated that the test results message is that the city's middle schools (collages) desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what's scary is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to respond to the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the elementary and early school classes who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier into their school careers and who are quite late to their peers.
Every day, the math program for Kindergarten (Maternal) classes in Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they were set up in the District by former leader Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think that we need to continue to work to provide better interventions to these students below the level of the class," said Rhee.
Others believe that NAEP's results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise overall system outcomes while providing money and resources for schools with less results in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at Berkeley University in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest districts in Washington.
This targeting can also have political implications that affect this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other School Superintendent, she is trying to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on developing a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, no matter where they are from, can be assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now the Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap in success was the duration of the traditional public school, today 180 days in the District of Washington, to be in competition with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "point of departure" to get an additional increase in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise for the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, goes down and blinks a moment in sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents were only able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
So, while she and other Grade 8 students (4th) in the group explored Gettysburg where the tuition fees are $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of an impressive new student than an enthusiastic one.
Super That's where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed who would like to study medicine, while the guide was leading them to the entrance to the science building.
Youpi, really? she said she thought, when she was told the low ratio law teacher - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this issue is still widely raised for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left the high school where they became parents in their teens, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a "second generation Hispanic" in five-generation college studies -- a remarkable success when it is considered that both their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without completing the high school.
Their success is important, researchers say, and they open the way for the next generations that will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study the batants claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the university -- in particular, if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepare you), it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that begin when students of low-income families are middle school (school) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil obtains agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has succeeded in attracting major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry in Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies left with a stake in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who put up an auction lost.
Two American companies obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there were Asian and European companies opening the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet news site.
It will take a long time for another offer to be made in Iraq.
The security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability while the U.S. military troops retreated, slowed down American oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with greater force, which has the world's third largest crude oil reserve, say analysts.
In some cases, American companies were disadvantaged by their rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided their technical advice, have broken their hands.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., held by the State, has been more interested in contracts than other companies and has left with significant participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesperson for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal with its competitors and will make its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected companies for auctions made offers that were then compared to the barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that an American missile, having hit along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, declared the counter-spyping authorities on Friday.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car, Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan province, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities stated that missiles were fired by a non-pilot aircraft of the type used by the CIA within Pakistan's anarchist tribal border.
They drove a white car, headed towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a Pakistani civil intelligence member speaking on Miran Shah's phone.
Representatives of the authority stated that the suspected local activists precipitated on-site and quickly confiscated what was left of "totally torn bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somalia was one of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the military organizers of al-Qaeda who led the terrorist operations of the group outside Afghanistan-Pakistan.
His role was to organize conspiracies around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to keep the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of the leaders of al-Qaida and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority stated that Somalia had made rapid progress in the ranks of al-Qaida's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the general American public, but this does not diminish the threat he poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second major character of al-Qaeda or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalololov, leader of a tribal belt activist, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also killing suspected informants ruthlessly, the site states.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul retires
The United Nations Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate filled with widespread allegations of corruption during the United Nations-supported presidential elections.
Eide's departure occurred when the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States calendar for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the good signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition to Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he did not resign but would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
Representatives claim that the name Staffan di Mistura was cited; it is an Italian-Switzerland citizen who recently presided over a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led the United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused in September of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of mass electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which he thanked -- "have been detrimental to the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism with regard to the international observation of the elections".
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the United Nations officials to authorize his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than he was assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in the way their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy recruitment regulations of the United Nations hindered its ability to bring new talent.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary for Defence, Robert M. Gates said Friday that the great world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of his inability to engage in nuclear ambition talks.
Gates, speaking in front of a midwife of 300 U.S. soldiers north of Iraq, during a week's visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, debaptized the eventuality of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the eventuality of such a outcome.
One of the things that weighs me the most is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said that "a set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "their people would suffer enormously from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran would face "probable" consequences if it did not bring its nuclear programme back to full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks, on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of its enriched uranium storage, in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed such an agreement, a means of developing confidence on both sides and making time for negotiations.
Since then Iran has shown itself to be far away from attempts of agreement - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, the expansion of Iran in the face of some of the international community's proposals for which they had actually agreed in early October prompted the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, to join in on what they had not envisaged, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals on 31 December, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement made in New York on Thursday, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "the baseless allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and affirmed its agreement to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane to the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet the Troop Leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in American plans to reduce the number of American troops, from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the anxiety of the Kurds about the outstanding withdrawal. The US authorities quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you."
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up around propaganda posters and preached to them, "The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An additional baby, it's an additional tomb."
They learned so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and by the ageing population, have radically changed direction this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31 years old, Director of Human Resources and who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child's policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good toys and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six children when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 per cent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission stated that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of labour in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
Progressive mitigation
Formed in the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the single child is, without a doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist Government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and be discriminated against in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous tendency for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some authorities have forced pregnant women of a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have had selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys and girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007 they softened a lot of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research, at the University of Beijing, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples, at their homes, and to drag prospectuses under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who wished to have more than one child.
According to the head of the family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although those responsible in a rural city in the suburbs of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for couple files wishing for a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be approximately 165 000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of Family Planning Committee in the Municipality of Caolu of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that they would love to have two children and that they were legally authorized to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and the life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners wrongly consider that the policy of the single child is a problem of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose woman is pregnant seven months of the first child of the couple.
True, we're stealing the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she only wanted a single child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and used to be the one that everybody was taking care of us."
We don't usually take care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company says it more quickly.
For couples working in two middle-class groups who lower the birth rate, he said, it is necessary to be selfish to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 grew up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don't want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even one child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his or her CV to get a place in the best nursery."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft emission reduction plans
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- characterized so far by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- has returned under the banner of the Friday ramp, due to the publication of a document highlighting ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations most of the burden, in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases highlighted the remaining obstacles, as well as the path to be taken.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the time-consuming negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from all over the world coming to Copenhagen next week.
Drafted by a United Nations ad hoc working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give the poor to support climate warming in the long run and in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and new emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that managers would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described on UN climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the complete image".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020 from 25 to 45 per cent compared to the 1990 levels, while the main developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 50 per cent to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations have occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, United States Representative for Climate Negotiation, rejected any discussion that required the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if they were not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration becomes more harsh to China than the Bush administration was, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the major developing countries, says Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei stated that the US main negotiator was "no sense", or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to combat climate warming.
With the future economic paths of the major world powers at stake, defects have appeared both in the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States arguing about their respective obligations while the poorest nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers were fighting to know who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their efforts to make the major issuers responsible for their actions.
This is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also climate advisor to Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries that are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum, political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, has drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, Head of the European Commission's climate unit, said that the action of small island States has "put political pressure on the complete political process", in part by what they are now unified and that they ask emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the issues before the Heads of Government reached agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Minister of Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister descended from their aircraft and rushed to the Bella Center building to attend closed meetings and briefings, in order to be able to make claims that will be considered during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- in which 13,000 people come in and out of the Congress Palace every day -- guitar-player activists present night shows mocking countries that they think are betraying themselves and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity only increases: almost all important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of governments will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the courtyard of the grandes, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for World Conservation International Policy.
The heavy weights are coming.
In Great Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine the Monday syndrome
At 5:13 a.m., Monday morning, a whistle will blow at night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while leaving Ashford, Kent, London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
It hopes that the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and will link the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
The small lost holes will become flourishing suburban cities, the length of business travel will be much shorter, and the passage of the plane and the car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new railway network, the inevitable battle for planning and the fears of danger to the environment are likely to slow down British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will deliver its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow you to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next step for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where environmental impact can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a higher speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will be separated in two to or near Birmingham, with one branch going west of the Pennines in Manchester and Scotland and another heading north-east towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour trip at present.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial trace is designed to allow trains of 400m long and capable of transporting 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that could accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offers this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be required to run off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland longer than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a transition from aircraft to trains, which is a reference point for rail revolution.
The taxpayers repay the 75,000 GBP loan for the Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the main member of the Tory Parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orange shop he built in his constituency home.
The party leader who was demolished by David Cameron to complain that the members of the parliament were "maintainers," increased his loan of GBP 75,000 to build a oak extension to his second house in Rutland.
He had been authorized to have the additional interest paid, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The common authorities received the complaints at that time and were not interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a control of members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan stated that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of the parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village of his constituency in Rutland - Melton.
The neighboring houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office states that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda at home, describing it in his plans as an orange tree.
Neighbors describe it as a "viranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not requested to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on Common Privileges and Standards concerning its prior borrowing provisions.
The Committee innocentized him last month of any charge of non-compliance with the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the 271,406 GBP loan of his London property to the house of his constituency which he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about GBP 1,400 per month of interest in borrowing until March last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RIB loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75,000.
The RIB variable standard interest rate rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication of the Commons authorities showed that Mr. Duncan continued to request GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Phantom Cabinet Officer in September, after a cover-up journalist allegedly filmed him saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's a national now, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated like "the m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a little piece, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for more, but I didn't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his former position as an oil merchant, began to explain his expenses in May, after he appeared to have asked for thousands of books for his garden, before agreeing with the office of costs that it could "be considered excessive".
An activist dug a pound hole in the lawn of M Duncan, to protest after it was revealed that he had asked for GBP 4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved both by the fee office and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of rape or the development or use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It could not be cleaner or simpler."
Faithful, come and see the Brighton Advent calendar
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way of promoting for winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each December day, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 to 6:30 a.m., each day, with pasta and hot wine served free of charge.
The songs of Christmas selected so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest of the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should come closer to people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the advent calendar of the beach cabin came right after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people have declared an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police have conducted several hundred inquiries.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers, have paraded in the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Conference on Climate, to conclude by Friday an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization on climate around the world, illustrated by these events, has contributed to making the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the court, when a group of 300 protesters, fully dressed in black, broke windows with pavements and hammers, observed a journalist from the AFP.
Anti-smuggling police officers were on the scene without any change.
In total, the police announced the interrogation of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them members of the Blacks Blocks, those ultra-violent groups that had illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were interrogated "without distinction", stressing that one hundred of them "were always held on the street Saturday night "menaged and held in position despite the extreme cold".
Part of Parliament, the court, rather good child, took the lead of the Bella Center, a site of negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, not trying to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the speakers planned, before a candle alert with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of demonstrators came in and out of the major cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in impermeable blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for the "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down to the streets to seek repair of the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, thought the Beninese singer Angélica Kidjo.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, watercourses where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement has drawn close to environmental organizations.
French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "today, there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which houses many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had given rise to demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had gone down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, have paraded in red, flying bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of a few hundred demonstrators have also been held to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
The separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
The Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5.00 p.m. GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in high school, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "explains that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating itself from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the electors who went to the polling station in a school in Soukhumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is at the heart of the Presidential in this region with sumptuous landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are installed a little everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district leader, Beslan Archba, provided a warm welcome to the Russian officials who came to monitor the conduct of the poll.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, said during a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba criticises the agreements with Moscow last year, such as the one transferring control to Russia on the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims to support neither the current power nor the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have traveled around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the living side, have interviewed nearly 700 people on the margins of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about one hundred thousand according to organizers, paraded in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until 18 December in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Part of Parliament, the court, overall good child, took the lead in the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped at about 500 metres from the center, without trying to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the speakers planned, before a candle alert with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the departure of the court, a group of a few hundred protesters, fully dressed in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, observed a journalist from the AFP.
Anti-smuggling police officers immediately surrounded them and intervened without planning, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the interrogation of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the Blacks Blocks, these ultra-violent groups that had been illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a peacock and four cars burned near a shark during incidents that led to the interrogation of about 20 people, according to the police.
We have on our eyes the extremist groups, had warned the spokesperson of the police, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces were turning to the sky.
The majority of demonstrators, who came by car and by train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in impermeable blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for the "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down to the streets to seek repair of the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, thought the Beninese singer Angélica Kidjo.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, there are watercourses where you can walk while you have never done so before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement has drawn close to environmental organizations.
French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told the AFP to come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "today, there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen, the former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who was to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which houses many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had given rise to demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had gone down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, have displayed red-dressed and bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, rallies of a few hundred demonstrators have also been held to demand action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
Geo history is strengthened by the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview to appear in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "reinforced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in the scientific terminal.
Now the first students will all have four weekly hours and the same programme for a shared common culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "we have to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S line is no longer a scientific line" but "in large, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L sectors cannot remain sub-filaments of the S, he continues, pointing out yet again: "I have not also heard many historians and intellectuals become aware of the absence of terminal geography history in technological lycées".
On Saturday, an Ifop survey published in Humanity revealed that almost seven out of ten French (69%) disagreed with the government's project to suppress the mandatory teaching of terminal geography. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some elected right.
On the other hand, the Minister added that it was not "no question" to delete the philosophy of terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they felt sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will have an eligibility test in the beginning of the year that will carry on their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will cover their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also follow internships during the year of M2 and will be a first year in front of students as interns teachers.
If you add all the courses offered before the competition, you already get more presence before the students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist in National Education".
It also reaffirms the project to delete the school card "by 2012".
At Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street School of Superior Normale.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, every 15 minutes, filmed and open to the public, observed a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that caught people and they wanted to know more, explained on the margins of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this day who took his name from the one given by the students to the fish in the school basin.
Some twenty interveners were selected from the discipline experts and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
Regarding climate warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about the key objectives in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but using graphs, in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that listeners will consider that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos from these conferences will be posted online on the school's website from December 15th.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled in February, followed by others at a two-month pace.
Delays in payments: anger of prison overseers, planned actions
The prison supervisors' unions called on Friday to "general mobilization" to require the payment of additional premiums and overtime by the end of the year, which was postponed in January for budgetary reasons.
FO- penitentiary (2nd union of supervisors) asked staff who will not be in service to protest Tuesday morning in front of prisons and "block them", to "denunciate the theft of their dues".
The CGT- penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "convene in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", finding "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "additional hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls it to general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Department of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were budgeted, but ensure that the relics will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a mail to the unions of supervisors ensuring that this payment would be made next month.
I do not know the efforts of the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I have asked the prison administration to put in place immediately a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of additional hours is not repeated in the future, says Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be slim, except for management staff with the famous job and target premiums, deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints have good back".
It was a scandal, the interregional union FO de Marseille was outraged, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if the ones in October are not regularized in December, the same for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when our tasks and missions are increased without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take the money of the staff, according to the Bordeaux Prison CGT.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less bad than others.
But anyway the account is not there, he found the secretary general of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he's offering more "cuttles" than the ones he receives
American President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas as a family at the White House, entrusted the "papes" of the little Oprah Winfrey screen that he had a simple gift rule: "I give nicer things than I get."
As part of a special program that will be broadcast Sunday night on the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle provide an overview of how they intend to celebrate the year-end parties in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the small, four-legged companion of the family will be on the side.
Father Noël also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would have "certainly" a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama took a false step against her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he receives: "I certainly didn't, I offered you nice gifts last year," she teased the president.
Absolutely, he was forced to give up before replying with humor by showing from his finger the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "Who offered you this?".
During this one-hour show, in the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous animator who was a strong support of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama referred to a 10-speed bike, but also a basketball ball that his Kenyan father rarely saw him offer at Christmas.
I remember this time I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball, said the president.
It was only later in my life that I realized it was him who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had lined all the furniture against the wall, rather than fix it around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL claims he's in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to significant "damage" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the US doctors had found "injuries resulting from the operation" of the discal hernia suffered in Paris on 26 November, indicated to Paris his press service, stating that these injuries had "needed a restorative operation".
The singer's press service, however, wanted to reassure that the situation was "under control", while a new medical bulletin would be provided within 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday would have been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, adds RTL.
Questioned by the PSA, the press service has neither confirmed nor commented on the information.
RTL also states that "according to certain sources" no drain would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic for this discal hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been carried out by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajous , a well-known physician in the art community.
This was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL information.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for a follow-up infection.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close to Johnny Hallyday, estimated on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured that he was "no concern" for the rocker, who is "a beater".
He had called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because it took twelve hours on the plane after such an operation, it's not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer Jean-Claude Camus wanted to reassure himself, asserting that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "pulled".
Mr. Camus had also said that he had met with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been subjected to a "small colon cancer", then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been highly commented. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the singer moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: the first of Bousquet on its fetish distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, a triple World medal in the 2009 Grand Basin, picked up an international title on Thursday on a distance he particularly loved, the 50 m free swim, during the Euro-2009 in a small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are last allowed saw only three world records beaten while waiting for a deferral.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relays 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, which was sweeping the world record of 50 m free, whose brand is in the large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was imposed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took off against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet preceded Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world brand (20.30) as he had planned.
We can always dream better and in the event, I had said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
At the beginning of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epic in Istanbul, which had welcomed the first in 1999 during the same competition.
The use of combinations did not serve this time to German Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in the great pool this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the brand he holds over 400 m free swim (3:32.77) but nevertheless stood by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: Sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola awarded 1.5 million USD
A panel of Roman sarcophagus that belonged to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded Thursday $1.5 million, well above his estimate, announced the art merchant Sotheby's.
This panel before two meters long on 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satires and bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," he explained to AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale is still under way, but this lot is certainly the one on which the buyers have most dear so far, told the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bath in his Parisian private hotel, and at Paul Reynaud, Minister under the III Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before the accession to power of the Pétain Marshal.
There remained a shadow zone of about 50 years.
By searching the Louvre Museum's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola sequence" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Therèse Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Aborted departure attempt from zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered on Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the fallen President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who had been denied an exemption by the putschist government.
For the time being, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Upon arrival in Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the plane of the Mexican government departed to its place of origin, according to a source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and ask for political asylum abroad to grant him an exemption.
But the fallen president refused, because he wished to go to Mexico as head of state in guest exercise.
The putschist government "has experienced a new failure by wanting me to give up my responsibility (...), they wanted me to resign", said Mr. Zelaya on radio Globo, which he has often expressed since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some agreements the fallen president, refugee at the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico has submitted a request for exemption, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, said on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, on Honduran radio RN.
I do not ask for asylum from any country, answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras should be made as President of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The starting rumors of Mr. Zelaya had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the fallen president, who came to gather around the Embassy of Brazil, where the military had strengthened their seats.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government with regard to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, the day he had held a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he had returned by surprise on September 21 and had fled to the Embassy of Brazil.
If he exits, he will be arrested to respond to the offence of "high treason" which is accused of justice, according to the putschist government.
The putschist President Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organizing a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial vote recognized by the United States but challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street goes up, the U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, the US trade balance figures testifying to the resumption of the activity of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, Dow Jones Industrial Avage increased from 68.78 points to 10,405,83 points, and Nasdaq, technologically dominant, from 7,13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index was 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
There is good news coming from different parts of the economy, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial said.
But this remains anecdotal, did it temper, considering that the market was concentrated on "the glass half full".
For Peter Cardillo, by Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on US trade balance figures, "which show that the activity improves in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit decreased by 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected that the deficit would be widened.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth of trade volumes, particularly for exports of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major US trading partners, Christopher Cornell, of the Economy.com research firm, commented.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States increased against all expectations last week to reach 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The return on the Treasury Bond at 10 years of age increased to 3,482% compared to 3,423% on Tuesday night and the return at 30 years to 4,492% compared to 4,408% on the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of power supporters make up the "White Ladies" · Global Voices
A few hundred Cuban government supporters composed on Thursday of wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Day of Human Rights, and prevented another demonstration for which about ten dissidents were arrested.
Some 40 "White Ladies", married or close to political prisoners, were conceived in the streets by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP observed.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" shocked, the raised fist, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
They were escorted by civilian agents who came to "ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana area of Vedado, about ten dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day were interviewed by police officers in civilian, a journalist from the AFP.
The police force in civilian vehicles has raised dissidents who have been made up by government supporters, according to this journalist.
Inquiries of dissidents in similar circumstances generally last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "White Ladies" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to dissident, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda was part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remained under locks.
Cuban authorities regard opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
In fact, Cuban television reported the demonstration on Thursday of pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of encroaching on rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forced man kills an octogenary with a knife and wound 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed two-shot force killed an octogenary and wounded five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of influx, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the aggressor, aged 28, would have been struck with two knives and for indeterminate reasons, an octogenary, in or in front of a pharmacy of the 85 Jean-Jaures boulevard, was learned from police sources and witnesses.
Grievably wounded, the old man, born in 1929 according to a police union officer Alliance, died in the hospital following his injuries.
In or in front of this same pharmacy, he then took it to a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, about thirty years old, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenary broke down.
The other injured day is in danger, with vital organs apparently being affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became ill and was reportedly hospitalized "in a state of shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the grip of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then have fled into the street, still boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have injured two passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a quadrant, the latter severely.
The scenario was still confusing in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives he wore in the cross behind his back, explained on the spot a union leader Alliance in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressed.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to evidence gathered by the PSA, tried to control the force.
I saw a guy in his 30s wearing a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept it.
They didn't get there because the guy was a seamstress, said Alberto, the server of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Always boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of n°61, two municipal police officers, their head, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded by fists, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Some passers-by came to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I noticed a very important pain in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person came in about thirty years, wounded with a knife.
It was the national police who arrested the man without his identity papers.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office of the Judicial Police of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) seized the investigation.
The coroner was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not exclude him from being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all the forces of this species whose forces decay under the effect of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the abandonment of prosecutions
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again claimed Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of prosecutions against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a matter of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeal of the Second District of California of serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I demand the abandonment of charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who died since -- would have discussed, before giving his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious procedural fault.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared late September to have "lie" to the documentary author.
In the event that the court refused to give up the prosecution, Mr. Hummel requested a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski would appear before the court.
The filmmaker, who was 76 years old, fled the United States in 1978, prior to his sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He's never set foot in the United States since.
Deputy Attorney of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the hearing."
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to flee?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "demands a favor to the court, while disregarding her authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that there were "other alternatives to escape".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to call for the abandonment of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed at every rebound in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure has been fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to residence in his Gstaad chalet, awaiting a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, brake by the increase of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended off on Friday, in a market drawn between better indicators than in the United States and the dollar increase: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Avage rose from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, with technological dominance, dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, Mace Blicksilver from Marblehead Asset Management noted.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think it will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "have helped to improve the market's view of the solidity of economic recovery", summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month of affiliate and much more than expected.
In addition, US consumer confidence increased significantly in December, to 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been slowed down by a further advance of the dollar, up to two months before the euro, which "throws down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of the Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The return of the Treasury Bond at the age of 10 increased to 3,540% compared to 3,482% on Wednesday night and the return at the age of 30 to 4,497% compared to 4,492% on the day before.
Miss Monde's election again in South Africa
After a month of adventure across South Africa, the 112 Miss Monde candidates are about to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the surrounding Johannesburg, five of them have already picked up their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Ka rgbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss sports or Miss top model during their African stay.
This was a real tourbillon.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I've seen so many things and I've had so many experiences!, Miss Sierra Leone exclaims.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17H00 (15H00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to give my crown back.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, says Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "the landscapes to cut the breath in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Misses are now focusing on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and to present this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both became Bollywood stars.
It's every woman's dream of being crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our country and I want to go home with the crown, launch Miss India with a broad smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will score this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimwear.
The show will be animated by a TV host, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a head of the Miss Monde Steve Douglas committee.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with warmth and pride that is difficult to match, says Julia Morley, President of Miss Monde.
The candidates have as last year made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time on bicycle, and tasted local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma, who held their hand.
No running for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will probably remain the draw in Cape West for the June 2010 World Football Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been with people I never thought I could approach.
I will without a doubt return to the 2010 World Cup, enthusiasm Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport where he was to visit his hospitalized father's hair for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's going very well, told the press David Hallyday on his way out of the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13h00 local (21h00 GMT).
The son of the singer, the relaxed air, assured that he was going to go "very fast" to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for a follow-up infection to the operation of a discal hernie on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for a follow-up infection to the operation of a discal hernia on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to Los Angeles's French high school on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade was educated, to attend a school performance, found a photographer of the AFP.
The head of orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salpétrière hospital, Yves Catone, announced that he would visit Los Angeles on Monday to the singer.
The producer violently questioned Dr Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the International Clinic of Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were out, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible future judicial procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus thought Johnny Hallyday was "too soon to leave for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it amazed me, as I had two discal hernias myself, did he add.
Earlier on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "part without drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art community.
He had operated actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where he was working at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to solve a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a physician to the sulfurous reputation, condemned on several occasions by justice, in medically responsible cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
I am Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a unscrupulous man" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of Order, and which is "far from being advisable".
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajous spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention had been "perfectly well performed" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any event, the singer's tour, whose health problems have increased since this summer, seems to be in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF Association increases the tone and sum of the New Centre to no longer use its seal
The UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem, reacted Friday to the POP's attempt by the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the seal of the former Giscardian party, by failing to use it on any media, under trial.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF seal, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after having stretched his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of his approach, he was supported by Mr Hervé de Charette (formerly NC UMP) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand for being the first to deposit it in 2004 with the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the UDF association's office, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be dispossed, came out of his silence to launch a stay with the Minister and the MP, summarizing them to no longer use the seal and to transmit to them the ownership of the mark, under penalty of judicial prosecution.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements indicating that you would propose to your political movement to +reprise+ the UDF seal, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You also thought it good to follow on your militant material and on the page of your website, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the slogan + today's UDF+, also noted the mail signatories.
As you don't know, you have no right to use this seal, explains the UDF office which still requires the NC to "promotely remove the name of the UDF from all media as well as (his) website".
He also asked Hervé de Charette "to transmit the property of (la) the mark to his legitimate rights".
If you did not do so, the courts would be brought before them to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, and they will warn the signatories.
In their mail, they state that the UDF "is an entire political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "choosed" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF (Union pour la démocratie française) in their view.
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 for its membership in MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, he continued the office, "when he filed the mark", he had been "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
It exploits scandalously and fraudulently the absence of deposit of the UDF acronym to perform it on its own.
This indecidence is becoming a crime, they denounce, before ironicizing on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for itself than to try to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled".
Case Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses him, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenary to spoil her part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter break apart while holding the realms of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt's medical expertise, aged 87, should be carried out collegially by three doctors.
L'Oréal's principal heir and shareholder has always refused to undergo such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors designated on Friday will have to submit a report by 10 March 2010 stating, in particular, whether Liliane Bettencourt has been in a state of weakness and at which periods.
I think she'll submit to it.
I'm going to talk to him about it, said Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman at the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) Expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's single daughter has been prosecuting François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist, who has been accused of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years to obtain one billion euros of gifts, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's tables.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-standing friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' pleadings sometimes turned to the big family play on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer referred to three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said to be suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer, "can you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to him since his marriage."
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office once again considered that the complainant was not admissible for action, especially since a guardian's judge had refused in recent days to apply for a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in justice, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Christitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial took place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Manageria revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the great French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile...
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of large companies to its employees has been a reminder of the position of the companies to consumers prior to the marketing revolution: it is a matter of having employees adhere to "values" determined from above, as it once was, to impose on consumers products thought of by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has handed over market conquer strategies to the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products from customer preferences factors comes back regularly!
A demobilisation of employees can result in a mortifying demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects particularly managers.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that authoritarian management revenues are totally against.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would be to put the employees at the centre of the company's concerns in the same way as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Are internal opinion surveys – like the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – going to encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally comes, after many deviations, to do priority... what it has always done.!
- Then, because of authoritarianism—one of the diseases of power—increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
In the major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old Behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the U.S. "nerosciences" and widely disseminated, to their own, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "leaves" (sic) of the engagement of managers, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr comforts leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, which is inadequate to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, implies adopting a finalist view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment to the company is possible only if it appears clearly as a means of realizing some of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, only the studies from the Reasoning Analysis adopt this design of employees' motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business based on a predetermined dose that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and restore their "local" human resources management.
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Speech from Oslo: The "Just War" Is Worth Praises to the Right in Obama · Global Voices
On Friday, the American right welcomed the speech delivered to Oslo by Barack Obama last night, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had embroidered the award of the prize to Mr. Obama on October 9, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, a former vice president candidate during the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, an army of the right wing of the Republican party, to the daily USA Today, adding that she had addressed the theme of war "sometimes necessary" in her newly published memoirs.
The war is of course the last thing in my opinion that the Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be arrested all over there, she said.
Mr. Obama, who inherited from the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday to justify the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done in Oslo "of the very good job".
I found that the speech was really good, congratulated the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this very historic speech, said Mr. Gingrich, interrogated during the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican Investment for the 2012 presidential election, was delighted to see "a left-wing president" reminding members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a peace price if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, a former pen by George W. Bush converts chronicler to Washington Post, Mr. Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke as an American president", reminding the Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it", said Mr Gerson.
Among the few on the right not to be convinced, a Bush-era falcon, the former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, described the speech as "land, pumped and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
On the left side of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When we wrap the war in the notion of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
The left-hand press, however, remained commendable for the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while still thinking that the Nobel Prize has been prematurely awarded to Mr. Obama, has qualified his speech as "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the Californian daily has set itself on fire.
Mr. Obama "spoke the speech he needed," said the New York Times, judging him "at the same time dark and edifying."
Roads: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three Marathon negotiations, the trade unions in the road sector and TLF, the only employers' organization to remain to the end, came to an agreement Friday evening that ended the strike call and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing session Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoked" of this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, started Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left in the early morning on Friday, hoping to sign the text of the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRA) had knocked on the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting that started at 11 a.m. to get everyone to agree and that at 6 p.m. the text was signed.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to businesses" and "he was afraid he would come to disrupt the holidays of the end of years," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages by 4 per cent for lower wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for higher wages (international transport).
At hourly rates, for low wages, "we move from EUR 8.72 to 9.06.
This is not much, but we start from far away, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
In other words, we're going to order our militants that there are no blockades, no blockades from the refueling centres.
But we can still have some recalcitrants that aren't happy, did he add.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed "a good deal", even though it was "hard to grant increases on high wages in the light of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "an historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the re-evaluation of travel costs of 3%, and the maintenance of general road transport status in the first half of 2010, which will enable, inter alia, to address the issue of a 13th month and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in employers' expenses" had been the subject of a government amendment to the amending Finance Bill for 2009, which was voted on Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly on Thursday to Friday.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in the same terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply first to companies that are members of this organization, and, secondly, to the whole profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
She will be "soon as soon as possible," said Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR has denounced a "dupee market", as the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to contradict the turkey eaters of the next awakening, has deplored Unostra.
For the Other, the agreement risks "increasing the grave of a large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, disgruntled unions of RATP proposals
The disturbances on RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a Friday meeting on the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the RATP leadership left them on their hunger for their premium demand.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of pre-Christmas purchases, there will be trains only between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m., due to one train in two on the central section (between the Defence and the Nation) and one train in four outside the central section.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travellers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which waits for 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is making efforts to serve large stores".
The RER A crossing from the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The short section RATP from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains traveled at peak hours, and almost no trains in deep hours, as planned.
As of Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the French had organized themselves.
Thus in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, especially due to the absence of colleagues and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), a 29-year-old engineer, Jack Nbakina explained that he got up "one hour thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive at the time".
Saint-Lazare Station did not experience any saturation, said SNCF, which had provided for the management of law enforcement officers and forces.
The RERs operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the station Saint-Lazare to reach the metros.
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged "poor" by the unions, of a meeting with management Friday afternoon.
The RRSP Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RRA A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
It is not what drivers want, who demand a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP is even putting forward its parentheses premium proposals, the CGT was outraged, stressing that management "was not bound to solve a problem while in roads and SNCF is done".
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", RATP said.
What also made the unions say that the company was "riding users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the Paris headquarters.
It was then that the management, who so far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "in an interest of calm".
The conflict threatens to expand to RRB Tuesday, following the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
Trade unions demand a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to millions of travellers daily.
The RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, are €2,200 to €2,700 gross and €600 to €650 premiums, for scheduled hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurdian party, heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court declared on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-kurd party, a decision that was immediately followed by anger demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task, which has just reached the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "flight of activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", the president of the Hasim Kiliç Court declared to the press at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified seven-vote majority was required to pronounce the dissolution, said Mr.Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including President Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity from Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Party's Treasury of property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
His leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered to be a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political showcase of PKK rebels.
The party claims, however, that it has "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict comes as the government has just held hands with the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to delay the support of the Kurds to the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had claimed that dissolution could lead to an increase in tensions in South East Anatolian, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
As of the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the south-east populated by the majority of Kurds.
Order forces fired tear grenades and used water cannons, while protesters launched molotov cocktails or stones, with frogs.
About a hundred people also showed up in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr.Türk stated that the Justice decision would "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurde, ndlr) by banning a party, he said to the press.
The Government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also deplored the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
That resolves nothing, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedoes of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, one can expect a PKK reaction, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauger wants is a harsh winter.
But the head of the road clearing and sanding service (ESF) clearly states that it is not to upset citizens.
It's just so that agents can test the vehicle technique and learn to master it well.
And according to meteorologists, this might well be this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to tackle snow and ice.
The EDF is following a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explained that as soon as he went snowing on the city of Frankfurt and that temperatures dropped below zero, large sanding vehicles traveled 20 main routes (called routes A) .
This includes large-circuit streets, major arteries, such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
Firefighters, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and slopes such as Atzelbergstraße are also included.
FS officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road shall be salted with a well-adhered road foundation within 3 hours of maximum time.
That's why the EDF service starts at 3:00 in the morning "so that the roads are cleared when the daily migration traffic starts".
That's when the snow goes down at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, tells us the head of the road clearing and sanding service "because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, if it no longer snows, we take care of access roads and desert roads - such as Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets are the last.
Mr. Brauburger is well aware that there are still a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the EDF's pedestrian team is on the way to making the areas considered dangerous and crossings clear.
As for cycle tracks, EDF services cannot usually deal with this.
Mr. Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt which was responsible for monitoring the state of the bridges between 22 and 4.30 hours.
As the frost forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also use this special service in case of need.
They were born with dinosaurs.
The Tawa Hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long for 1.50m high, its posterior limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was filled with sharp and curving teeth, its short arms ended with scarf claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt reports from the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine, the Tawa Hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the land that emerged from the supercontinent, the Pangea and was heading towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa sheds light on a new day the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the relationship, the distribution and the characteristics of the kinships.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt began searching with other paleontologists on the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irris of the Utah Natural History Museum and a member of the search team tells that sometimes they could find a dozen bones in one day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The searches updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories regarding the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named it Tawa according to the word of the Hopi Indians for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: the dinosaur fossils from Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, however it states that it allows to confirm certain theories regarding the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth approximately 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify all the first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, when the swarfs have been divided into three major evolutionary groups: the theropods (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaur and the velociraptor that later appeared and descended from birds, sauropods, long neck quadrupeds, and those that are related to them and ornithischians herbivores, including species such as triceratops and stegosaur.
According to the studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers found clues that the Tawa Hallae had small air sacs in his skull-level bones, as well as birds that are the offspring of the the theropods.
These small air pockets facilitate the breathing of birds compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air bags in its bones.
Since the apparent line of the vast sauropods also had air bags and a light bone, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive migration waves to North America.
Since the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, researchers concluded that the sarians appeared there.
As a result, the three major lines of evolution have divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. all the emerging lands that formed the Pangée Supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the Paleontologist team has also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot come down from a common ancestor that would have migrated, advancing researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History of New York and co-author of the journal Science Studies says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
Of course there are some contradictions.
Martin Sander, paleontologist in Bonn says there is an even older species, the silesaure, which lived in present Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong vision because in South America there are a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved while virtually none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how did dinosaurs become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary age while coming from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, still remains a mystery today.
At the time of Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the current crocodiles and many other Syrians.
At the end of the Trias the dinosaurs spread across the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassics.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There could have been a massive extinction in which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or, then, dinosaurs were better suited and they were thus able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favourable to the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and which since then had vegetated in the shadow: these were mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors at the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, Vienna University or Berkeley University in California.
There are those of lecturers at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt was evacuated by the casino police.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University, as well as other institutions of higher education in Germany, Europe and North America and South America, express their solidarity with the protest students of the Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police claimed by the University Steering Committee.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers on strike after walls and works of art had been barred from graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories felt that the degradations did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commando against the students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation is an "unacceptable threat" to freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing exclusively on vandalism only serves to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and attempts to make the reasons for mobilization forgotten.
The Steering Committee of the University was thus absent from discussions that would be essential.
Court officials require that criminal proceedings be suspended immediately.
The majority of the occupants did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimization of protests
The young people of the Green Trade Union of the services sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGS) are supportive of students.
Protests are only the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Regional Secretary for Youth of the Verdi Union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took action and brought action by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the places is totally unacceptable, she told the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday at the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, expressed the CDU Member of the regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Left (Die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the La Gauche Party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about students' arguments and claims, they are evacuated.
The La Gauche Party tabled a motion that amounted to the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new Silicon-valley
For a long time it was known as a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a secret weapon search site under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from central Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important micro- and nanoelectronic production and research sites are located there.
As of September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, the location of the French science – with the academic institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of Close Collaboration".
The signatories were the deputy mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz Head of Project Section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
Conversely, Russian scientific companies want contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet institutes and research companies.
It includes the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnics, the large Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika companies.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd draws its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which the research centres are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The magnitude of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be sufficiently high.
For its supporters it is nothing less than "the new heart of Europe".
S21, it is much more than the landfill of a railway station, than a colossal construction project that will sink the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg, into a desperate chaos of construction sites for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the 1980s.
The railway stations, with tracks ending in the middle of the city, had a reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th century transport technique that made the effect of modern rail traffic brake sabot as it took a long time to pass the locomotives from the back to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what we have to do.
That's why the liners must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart also: a train pass station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Rail Magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava from where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long been not compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to bury the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, the railway stations no longer really pose entry and exit problems since there are modern trains, reversible with autorails and car-pilot at both ends.
However, we are now launching the realization of Stuttgart 21 next to the new trace of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
Regional and communal policies have taken it.
The railway company is part of the party because it is the taxpayer who makes the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if you believe the graphs of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the expansion of the section are designed for a traffic of people to whom - and it is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At that time there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on the strengthening of the traffic of goods because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new trace, with its inclinations, does not fit the freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, EUR 6 billion will be included in the Souabe project.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of connection and congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentions sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been constructed slowly.
It would be very urgent to fully support the fungus here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking sabot.
The route of the Rhine Valley is about to become the bottleneck of international goods traffic, which is at the very heart of Europe.
The Government reviews the judgment of the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Government of the Land referred to the possibility of appeal to the Hesse Administrative Tribunal for the prohibition of night air flights.
The Minister of Economics Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had instructed experts to review from a legal point of view the judgement rendered by the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the proposed construction of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport would be carried out.
The authorization to land 17 aircraft between 23am and 5pm, as envisaged by the Government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air damage.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to file an appeal against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticises this time frame and tries to pressure the government representative to file the complaint with the Federal Administrative Tribunal in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD Group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their pledge made before the elections and which consisted of banning night flights. Otherwise, this will be judged as a total failure to a given word.
It is very difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the Chief of the Green Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's electoral slogan "We keep our promises."
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's complaints that the government of the Land is still trying to authorize night flights using "avocado and roubledness".
It takes time to carry out a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make decisions on the basis of a "first rapid impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of its fraction on the ban on night flights is completely mistaken.
U.S. Banks Pay Back Aid
The large American banks, heavily affected by the crisis, are falling apart from their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully reimbursed the Treasury $45 billion (over EUR 30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The U.S. television network CNBC reported that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions seek to rid themselves of imposed restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of the amounts, such as the limitation of the bonuses awarded to the executives and the higher fee settlement.
The Bank of America launched an increase in capital through the sale of securities to investors that provided it with $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the amount comes from banks that are well filled by the sale of several branches from other sectors.
On Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank of America, expressly thanked US taxpayers: the capital injection helped considerably to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capabilities by buying Merrill Lynch's investment bank at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to obtain money in the financial markets in order to free itself from the State's custody.
As a result, the U.S. bank could launch a 20 billion-dollar capital increase as early as Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain quoting the banking community.
Citigroup's spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had reimbursed the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Finally everything happened even sooner than expected.
Just two weeks after the current limogage of the editor-in-chief position Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German ZDF chain, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey who runs the Berlin edition of ZDF was the big favourite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to harm the ZDF's steward Markus Schächter further if the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is the candidate for Schächter, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Bender's contract by five years, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council voted in favour of the re-election of Brender and 7 others voted against. Brender's voting dismissal represented a failure which was quite predictable and predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is the majority on the Board of Directors, had already let him hear several weeks before the vote, did not want to take Bender back to his position.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief by invoking the fact that the ZDF's reporting rate had fallen under Bender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, eroding the growing political influence on the ZDF.
At the end there were even 35 experts in public law who had interfered in the debate and believed that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it won't do any good.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political sciences, pedagogy and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked in the Südwestfunk (Rhénania-Palatinate radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national citizen).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first of all at the news magazine "high-journal" (journal of today).
Then he continued his course: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then until 1998 he was chief and presenter of the "Morgenmagazines" (a bimonthly broadcast presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then chief editor of Berlin.
After Brender's misfortune, while he had just been elected a journalist of the year by the specialized journal Medium Magazine, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent to the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the intruder's staff proposals could not be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political personalities from the ZDF Supervisory Commissions.
Peter Frey, Brender's probable successor had skillfully worked with the Board of Directors by criticizing the commission with vehementness in his decision to limoger Brender.
With this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as well as the Board of Directors could elect it without being suspected of placing a political partisan in the position.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified liberal from the left.
Large cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to show themselves more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and delegates of the Conference of Rectors, an agreement was reached stipulating that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of the examinations: a single examination must enable the chosen study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload must be recognised to ensure "realist and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder also undertook to organize more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master sectors.
At regional level, there should be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Less reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the directors of universities have constantly spoken the expression of fashion: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board decided to significantly reduce the number of examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", can be read in a document of about 30 pages on the future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the Accreditation Board, states that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, we should be able to stop the slippages, which were significantly detrimental to the studyability.
The "studyability" should also be the decisive criterion for the organization of studies in the future.
Modules as well as the background should be carefully examined to see if this feeling of suffocation, which is sometimes felt in the choice of courses, cannot be avoided.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition considers that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the possibility and scope of manoeuvre necessary to allow and promote personal initiative".
The new regulation will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only by 2015 that all cycles have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put pressure on the Länder to pressure the agencies so that the programmes were not too busy and the review regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized higher schools have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
The Rhine-Palatinate has so far been the only Land to have agreed to give more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organise tutorial programmes and strengthen educational guidance offices as well as examination offices and international relations service.
The Länder and universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wishes to submit to Parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act.
As a result, only one examination will be needed to complete his studies.
The organisation of the studies will need to be more flexible, and the recognition of notes from other higher education institutions must be guaranteed and access to the Master should be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all university cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the question of the conditions of study in the country.
Decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students stated that he would like the organization of education policy to no longer happen in the future "behind closed doors" of the Ministers and Rectors of Universities.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as persons should be able to express themselves a little bit.
The future graduates of higher education were supported by the President of the delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful to us" said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the union of education and science (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It calls for the right and the possibility for each Bachelor graduated to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller member of the GEW Steering Committee also asks that the Länder assure Bachelor students today, that there will be enough seats tomorrow for Master studies and the conditions of study as good as possible.
The Länder must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of facilitating access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrived in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work of the poet Werner Söllner, in which he feared in shorts of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and subsequently director of collection in a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received several literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly coveted chair of poetry at Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of Hesse's literature forum at Mousonturm's artist's house in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the deforming mirror of your Security dossiers".
Söllner, visibly destabilized and embarrassed, made a statement in which he acknowledged before his fellow German-Roman writers Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Political Police Security.
Söllner received the German language award in 1989 jointly with some of the participants.
Recruitment trials had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, Söllner concludes, "so someone who has not been able to resist the intimidation trials of Security."
The poet Werner Söllner is informer Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its exemplary literary disintegrations with the mechanisms of power of dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the absems and the lowness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own security record, IM Walter played a role, assures the literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
"He was able to get him out of all the difficult situations at the time," Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, however, the notice of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is not, in fact, so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for security spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have made speculations and sometimes guess what real names were hiding last the names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter borrowings.
Unlike Germany where, in the meantime, the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Security files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been constantly counter-tracked and slowed down in the past few years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of Security (CNSAS) but the restitution of the files has been somewhat delayed since.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former security officer from Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expresses herself in a manner that is very insulting to the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end, she was questioned only once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here, without any genes, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many ineluctable questions are associated with the Söllner case as so often happens in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been flogged? The weighted reaction of the listeners, to Söllner, leaves the hope that the continuation of this chapter will be more defined by a desire to know that by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumults at the Champions League
It was felt that a representative arrived there, shot at four pins coming straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the manufacturer of sports items had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross mounted at midnight less the quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier by hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, allowed himself to be led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our five-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he had not drunk alcohol and he was also not drunk with happiness.
He had had a nice evening, but tomorrow he had to get back to work.
'Cause now it's gonna start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just begun three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final," that is, in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against Uniera Urziceni of Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal struggle not to recover."
The "great work" awaits us on Sunday.
There, it is a question of repeating to Mainz the results of the league of champions daily.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced the surface after the three expeditional goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Luck drawing
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16/17. + 23./24 February/ match return 9/10. + 16/17. March) will be fired at Nyon on December 18.
The joy of Babbel's successor's fulminant function was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only at the one who had been lucky, who had passed on to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and I told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "soul approval" – Gross - the recipe for the success that sounded so much but that did no more effects with the caregiver Babbel.
He triggered some magic, he said Jens Lehmann - Babbel's partisan, "in football when there's a new impulse sometimes happens things that would never have been thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of pause for injury, goes to the top of the player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "problem" observed by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the new chef's method of work: "It's someone who moves on to action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't crossed the line yet, warned manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs mainly tenacity.
Just like Gross, players and the manager are careful to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated defence and weakens Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with the 0:4 , objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't had a hard time yet.
That Heldt on the day of his 40th anniversary has not had the heart to celebrate, even after the first home victory for three months, is due to the weekend events that a TV interview by the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann made rebound just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, would counter Heldt, in response to Lehmann's acute criticism.
He had accused the management of a weak style and said she had decided to change trainers under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also regarded as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of free time after the games had been removed from him.
Lehmann's statements were "troubled by selfishness" Heldt spoke and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for the life of these two quadragenaries.
In any case, they agreed on everything else, that is, without the pre-work of the group by the coach replaced, strong sport and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for the most part in success" retorted Heldt and Lehmann in choir – and even the man in the plastic bag aquiesça.
World heavyweight championship
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly provoked verbally and managerially the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title of heavyweight world champion according to the version of the WBC Federation.
At the same time as the judges, it is necessary for the points to be taken.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title of heavyweight world champion.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night, the 38-year-old champion had won a victory at the points at the same time as the judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends with honor his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already won twice the WBO and WBC federation world championship title.
Unfortunately, he didn't make the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, out 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, had to confess twice his defeat for injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th battle.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2.02 meters, against its left.
Johnson, of eleven centimeters smaller that, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, succeeded in avoiding the champion's shots, thus urging Klitschko to bring into play his dangerous right.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has mainly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continues to provoke Klitschko in words and in gestures his blows only rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, he passed the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital Switzerland before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko the "violent zombie" who "is not really capable".
During the heavy Friday, the champion couldn't help but provoke Johnson by dropping his nose sunglasses "in order to see his eyes."
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko re-imposed in his fourth battle since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten at the time Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had once abandoned without a fight.
This year, defending his championship title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a shot in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Haye cancelled a game against Vitali Klitschko, which was scheduled to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotional company is planning to play this game now at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz Affairs.
The SPD and La Gauche parties (Die Linke) ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz air strike, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a contraverity" on the murder strike of two tank trucks last September," said the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the issuance of information from the ARD chain "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given to total disregard for the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
In substance, the contents of the NATO report, which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the goal of the attack was in reality, not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to NATO's survey report, 142 people were killed or injured during the U.S. air attack that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Gauche asked on Saturday chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to speak in the shortest possible time before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Künast party are of the view that Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Government if the chancellery, the army and the intelligence services approved this new strategy.
The Government's spokesperson categorically rejected these criticisms.
The Chancery has in no way influenced the military's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were becoming increasingly loud to express doubts about the real reasons for the return of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Ministry.
According to the SPIEBEL newspaper, the information they had given to Guttenberg regarding the attack on tank trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some embarrassing details from the Minister.
However, in the vicinity of the two senior officials, it is suggested that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have requested a clarification of the facts in a mail in the meantime.
So far, he has not received an answer
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these charges and referred to the Federal Parliament Board of Inquiry, which was to become the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dream
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in psychic patients, or under the effect of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest themselves during sleep, everything is fine.
When we are lying in our dark rooms, we can find ourselves without hindrance to the most insane dreams and ghosts.
However, the one who, awake, experiences the state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world to be mad or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices only appear in psychic patients or as a result of drug use.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes stimulates the limits between dream, madness and reality to melt.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best case it is called visions, to the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect stand out, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingo, the drug experiments of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitter substances of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts often occur during schizophrenic psychosis.
The ground attraction force no longer has power over the person.
From antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always considered the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, the hallucinations were a form of wake-up dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T becomes a character of a comic strip.
Its body is in two dimensions with created colors.
Earth's attraction has no more power over it, it's flat on the ceiling.
He's feeling a bit.
Behind him were winged, grizzly devil creatures, bloody mouth, showing the teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain in the whole body.
Voice thundering, wicked, screaming, coming out of walls and radio.
He can no longer stand these voices that insult him and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo chain, in fact a loop and attach to a hook fixed to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and hovers the loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop's ticking.
Let it be a lesson to you, scream the voices in a choir to rip the tympan out of him. "Go to a clinic and get yourself taken care of!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last 2 years, the first of about 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is manic-depressive, it takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, and he's been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers from at least once in their life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer make a difference between the internal world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitation, which makes them suffering from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter disruptive signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tangle of ideas and fantasies coming from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis focuses on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry of the CHU of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrene is located in the center of the situation, with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time it is found in a passive role, it is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That's why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
To experience once in his life a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the life takes place in a real setting.
Why does our brain make this kind of kid, it's always a puzzle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to temporarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that the individuals concerned are suffering from minimal brain damage.
Neuronal maturation of the brain is assumed to be disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a mother's viral infection during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what is still unexplained is the way the neuronal system anomaly occurs and the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, however there is predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychos because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain warms up.
What's crazy, Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten from Lübeck tells us is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of viewpoint.
Kasten has been gathering reports on hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are among the typical concomitant phenomena of psychoses but also an impressive number of many other pathologies.
Among them are mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising that in some conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when brain areas that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently cooled; when our brain warms but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state just like brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, sorrows of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledge that they have experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, 16-year-old Sarah K. lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania and went to high school.
A girl to be normal to be true.
If there were no images and voices.
During recreation, a young boy, thin, long-haired chestnut, sometimes speaks to him.
When she answers her friends look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She may even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this nice young man.
Am I crazy, she's wondering sometimes.
But she well knows that this young man and other visions are not real and will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
Often visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she happens to be unable to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while she is invisible to others and that the teacher is visibly explaining equations in the table.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep that happens too rarely and too late, she can't often make a distinction if she is awake or already dreams, if the images she sees, the grumpy faces or the girl with bloody laces on her arms and legs are in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or friends, they'd take it for crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is today 20 years old.
She had her bac last year and she lived with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact over the Internet with Dr Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is great that he will have hallucinations after a while.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, so there's animation.
Sarah K., the only girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played by herself.
His hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was an age to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain zones that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Each experience", according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Healthy people's hallucinations are not fundamentally different from acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
Unfortunately, in our world too focused on consciousness, there has been a tendency to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but also containing something positive, creator - madness is a work of despair art.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniroid experience, a particular form of the modification of consciousness raised by the dream.
Oniroid lives are very complex semi-rejectives that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The state of onyroid consciousness manifests during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with fully aware polyradiculopathy, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that damages his life with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental limit between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
This is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, an organizational capacity which is given to us, men, not to darken in the void of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
The Zuricher Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his oneroid experiences in his book "Change of heart" as a safeguard of the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious leaves for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during that time, his body is condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen dives into a world that he has created of all parts, visits of foreign places, travels in time. He sees himself as an old man raised in a railway sanatorium, a robot with his hair careful about his health.
He lives in the middle age among nobles who manufacture blood-based narcotics.
He is taken away by a Greek motorcycle who takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It absorbs completely into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these interior travels are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes by describing what he experienced.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even in later years.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and intensive than the real life.
The intensity of this experience brings out the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of the external reality are even in a state of vigilance.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snows can fall
Burd
At the age of 27, the children will take the next step in the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment as CEO of Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to resume the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 years of age and are firmly committed to integrating society, said Hubert Burda, 69, at Spiegel.
All details have been resolved in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
It will also be necessary to see if they are capable of it.
It is not possible to impose its children on 7,500 employees without knowing whether they have the ability to deal with them.
This would demolish children as well as business.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he had retired from the position of President-Director-General as of January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently, he was in charge of the Treasury sector, that is, he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the lead in marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children were 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the family's hands.
The ruins have always taken place in the families who have been trained by a bubble of capital, which have made enormous unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
I've never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I do not see myself in the role of the leader of the country as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you can wish, in the matter of beauty and well-being, is within reach.
This is the goal that has been set by El Corte Inglés, which has just opened up in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of over 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious signs such as Hedonai, laser hairdressing specialist, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a sports room, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a ray of food, with in particular a tea salon, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation area in order to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a session of jacuzzi, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, it is 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms, where the most innovative face, body and hydrotherapy are available.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The sports room also has these virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything begins with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to do our exercise program properly.
His director assures that 15 minutes (heating and stretching included) are enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And, if after having made our body work, we want to go through the hairdressing salon, the sign Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer rituals of repair of hair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the slogans of this urban spa, which will be opened every day of the year from 10 a.m. to 22 p.m.
Miscellaneous take-offs
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of stars to adapt it to our wardrobe.
The shape of the decolletity, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must consider.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated take-off. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, equipped with the electric car
The Endesa electric company, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Hall, created the "LIVE Office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" will define and coordinate the roadmap for the installation of the electric car in the city and will establish mobility agreements, by taking steps, coordinating, providing subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville come to join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa is taking with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a series of complementary projects such as the G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT Verde.
Zapatero brings "a future of tranquility" to the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, asked for "a future of tranquillity" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
At the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures undertaken by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitiveness Plan of the automotive sector, we would now have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"Through this plan and the decision of brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of tranquillity for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integrated Plan for the Motor Sector (IPA), devoted €800 million to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than €3,000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, put in place in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by "40 per cent" in November.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Exhibition of Collection Cars, a meeting space for professionals and enthusiasts of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is an exposure area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
It will not only be possible to find motorcycles and collector cars, but it will also be possible for ClassicAuto Madrid to find items of any kind related to the world of the engine.
For example, at the exhibition hall, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will bring happiness to collectors and curious people.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Mos Classics and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restoration, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration, or Cochera Classics, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Outdoor aptitude test
But the trade activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with motor vehicles and motorcycles will also take place on an equipped circuit outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop : A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sports spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated the engine stop and start system i-Stop, a device that, at least for the time being, is only available on the 150-horse petrol 2.0 engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it has obtained as a whole.
Details, finishing the vehicle, housing, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control board and the console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Japanese, both of them, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and especially with the Gulf of Volkswagen, that they all want to overcome.
By continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough housing to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, there is a great box for regular forms.
The engine stopping and auto-starting system, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-litre and 150-horse petrol engine and with manual change of the six-speed engine.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, low noise, performance and control of its consumption.
Although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those that do not perform a large number of kilometres a year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is Sportive, i.e. the one with the largest number of serial elements.
Among the serial equipment, the track change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive inner mirror, the dashboard on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio, and the 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
Furthermore, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes among other elements of bi-xenon adaptable beacons and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is illustrated in particular by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not perform many kilometres a year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the fuel engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, between €21,770 for the Luxury finish and €23,270 for the tested model, Sportive.
In return for this important amount, Mazda3 will offer us a great amount of satisfaction each day.
Luxury "First"
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality incarnate by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever dazzled us, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the coming out of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark "lady".
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows to look at his e-mail, without offering the possibility would only be to see certain types of attachments or to navigate on the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
Indeed, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, less than half of what costs, for example, the iPhone's date subscription.
In view of its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, six times more expensive than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the The Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American grandfather, but has a surprise.
The monthly subscription price, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately looking for a café on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) in order to view their mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it should have worked for a long time.
In fact, some operators have special arrangements and travel options, but as far as I'm concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and have good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated reminders from the European Commission to propose affordable roaming tariffs across Europe have had a barely perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it's always curious that it's called the Fon when it doesn't have Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators start thinking differently and studying various proposals to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other Internet searches.
No subscription and no payout.
It is a connected device and is paid when it is purchased and not every month.
And this is what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: an option to buy with access to life as Peek already proposes in the United States.
Not that I wanted to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a more just formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the preferred color of the first lady in the United States.
If she went to Barack Obama's position in the U.S. presidency with a dress and a coat of that color, she chose the same to accompany him at the second moment, no doubt the most important of her life: the surrender to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: apart from their similar color, a yellow pulling towards the green with bright reflections, twice, the dress consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So much so that at first glance, it would appear that the first lady of the United States followed the seat of the Princess of Asturias and chose to hand over the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick lace for the take-off, it would bring a printed veil to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium heel green shoes for the first time, and a similar but golden model this time.
The hairstyle also changed: the hair is now raised while it was wearing the hair on the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased over the past few years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Federality and Professional Career of Women in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey, conducted in 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers have experienced limited careers due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life in couples and the number of children, whether or not the woman works and the type of employment occupied.
Those who do not have activity outside the home, work part-time or have an unstable job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are pushing people into marriage and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after they have settled in a couple, which is 4.1 for those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with a stable job have needed more time in their lives to obtain it, which has led them to push the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences maternity, but less the starting date of common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that increases the age gap in the marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who did elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"An additional distinction is also found among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have completed elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have done intermediate or higher education reverse this program and give priority to achieving stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
The Oreal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will incarnate the image of several brand products, ringing the universal motto "Because I value it well".
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses of the international scene, has come to join other celebrities inscribed at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones to enter this club if selected were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
In men, the cosmetics brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, lessons of anatomy) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, creators and models, from yesterday and today, met for the annual award of their prize, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best model of the year.
The Ace Poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have passed through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not according to predictable and apprehended genres (biographic summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The trip is exciting and Vincent spares neither the friars nor the lights.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you here for a few moments.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, that even I felt without naming it: the pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between impotence and ignorance, with a poetic mood dazzling, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that nearly killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he conjured the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven by the path of loss."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre peaks of universal literature, which must be engraved on the north side, on which the best mountaineers are still leaving and always taken."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a land owner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collects the cry of dementedness pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to bring his echo to the depths of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he made it in the escape of himself and invoking the posteriority with a violent speech to the asticots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled and prayed: "God, dear, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved the verses of Spenser: "The sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after life, tired of death. "
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband agreed very normally that she told him that Edward VII was spying on him among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man as patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent went beyond madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it is to try to conceal Joyce from Baroja?
What's Benet trying to do if it's not to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did this do if it was not to aspire to the glory of this man to serve him as a pedestal?"
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years passed by her and our dog, a bloodmelon, saved from the SPA and did not weigh more than six kilos, and without a word, they sat to her two feet that left the dog severely injured.
Our outrage is immense because we don't see what it's funny to attack for free a little animal without a defense that was also in the leash.
It is necessary to add to this the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, comes to fear for her physical integrity, since an energy that attacks an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, child, old man or, ultimately, anyone weaker than him.
The episode took place about 5 p.m. on Tuesday like another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog moaned all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint at the neighborhood police station even though we doubt that it is useful and not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to make it clear that the killer cowards were Spanish.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with young people so they find it fun to treat a helpless animal free of charge that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, assemblies for the wearing of the helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tires, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet, mainly among younger motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, since it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin stated that this campaign was part of his commitment to road safety, which "exceeds the design and production of increasingly secure products" and stated that it contributed to this objective through other educational and informative actions.
This new encouragement campaign for the wearing of the helmet in two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly secure products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of the Anfafk and Ganvam manufacturers, that of the concessionaires.
However, the good news needs to be announced, since the comparison reference in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite last month's rebound, registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous fiscal year.
Since January, all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pick-up, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95 853 have been sold.
Large clouds that affect most of their demand have not dissipated; indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in the limitation of bank credits, other factors such as the increase in unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic environment should be added.
In view of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, the aid for the purchase of 2000E has been of little use.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit from it, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for administration to focus particular attention on these vehicles and industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) was reiterated.
The concessionaires' association provides for a year 2010 similar to the one ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (tourism vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As has been the case with the ABS braking system and as will be the case with ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a shortage period has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The purpose of the measure, imposed by the European Union, is to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, through its mode of action, it can also help to avoid numerous rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always hold the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the Bosch car component manufacturer, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to support the pre-collision brake, and half of them had not benefited from its full strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in revenge, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of these intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four fatalities with injured people would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects the obstacles and prevents the driver, as well as acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exercises the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors rejects the plan for Opel until January
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on 8 –, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it would take more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, understood that each point of the plan had been approved beforehand by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, be postponed to the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be made within the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian group Converg, takes importance.
In case there would be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious jewels, the Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and succeeded in shrinking it from nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to pass, first, the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual low roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, 15 other kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of winnings, to mount sports boats, 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, winning another six kilograms and replacing the door handles with tissue handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double clutch PDK box, the test was performed on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on roads of the secondary network of California, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour can only be described as irreprehensible.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: for a long time we had not tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees such safety in the turns, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at small speed for as long as necessary, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
It's what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as specified, the car will do as our hands will indicate on the wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Motor sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that changes the engine rust, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either at the stop or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The surface of the roads we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car managed the chicken nests well.
Electronic assistants barely showed presence on the whole route, while on some turns we found greens in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
Finally, an ultra-light car, the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than just a change of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of EUR 70 831.
Bag Girl
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the parades of the house, the singer shows her face as bad a girl with as much container as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or "It Girl" is a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia is offered a victory in Israel
The Caja Labor has achieved a triumphal triumph at 91-82 during his visit to the hot field of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic's team. It is thus at the head of his group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic, which, with eight three-point baskets was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team has been able to fill the significant absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large amount of commitment and collective work, although it has had to wait until the end to win the victory.
Moreover, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three marked points, largely determines the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blues and reds, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, suggested that they had jumped on the Israeli field with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the leading artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's inner game and Eliyau's work, which was received by applause and applause back to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to notice himself as the best player of his team, with 13 points marked, although Splitter's "less six" evaluation was already suggesting that this night was not going to be the best of Brazilians.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from there, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria's team that they didn't win so easily on their ground, and thanks to "Elias' hand," they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellow taking advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, injured but far from being killed, needed to chain up some skilled actions to catch the air, and it was at that time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerged that, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas returned the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the premises succeeded in emphasizing at the end of the third quarter-time (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play everything during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they would not let anyone take what they deserved during the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
In spite of this, and with Splitter eliminated for errors, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defend well, and although the Israelis approached at the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
Unicaja lost sharply in Greece against the Olympiacos and gave him the head of Group B of the Euroliga, during a game marked by the absence of players from Unicaja, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of the Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, at the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the internal game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, led to the reversal of score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a beginning of battle, between North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to function by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on Unicaja.
The internal players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the 44-32 advantage at the nineteenth minute.
An impossible climb
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, showed himself superior and even equaled the difference of the meeting at Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, leading the group.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to her organization, to Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left some hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But victory was practically impossible because the Olympiacos proved relentless when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, at thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympics.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate ads, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The "How Much Should You Be Payed?" tool calculates user wages from over 140,000 job offers found in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you have to register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For a week since the application worked, the search engine has generally found that the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to data available to Trovità from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well-paid.
A British computer programmer receives €45,226 gross per year and a Frenchman, €31,059, while a Spanish man receives €24,000.
Likewise, a driver earns €34,247 gross per year in England, €25,751 in France and €16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid work in Spain is that of a server, with 11 592 euros per year net, followed by that of a seller, with 14 725 euros, and that of a worker, with 15 667 euros.
The most popular Internet jobs in the last three months are driver jobs, half-time jobs and social workers jobs.
Brazil sets a date for departure from Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a time limit for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his Tegucigalpa Embassy.
The reversed President shall be required to abandon the diplomatic law no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business at the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, following his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The chain also mentioned the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
Finally, the operation failed, as Zelaya refused the political exile condition which the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After pink days since last spring, during which the inflation of assets has been the dominant mark on the markets, uncertainty has arisen again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise markets has been to monetaryize debt through the purchase of assets directly and indirectly by providing liquidity at close rates of zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to be mobilised.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct acquisitions of assets have been almost completed and, without jeopardising their non-conformity liquidity policy, they are beginning to put some sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their award to one year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are seeing a reversal of risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and differences in corporate obligations are increasing again, although they remain very far away from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Again, there is a flight to quality, and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuges chosen by investors, leading to an increase in differences between euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this instability episode, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a further down-revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not wrong to silence moral risk defenders, who were once again trying to raise awareness among those responsible for global economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects of the limitation of credit on the destruction of employment, while what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is similar to a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore their place to power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the rose pot.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be totally unreasonable for the Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member country to fail to meet its commitments.
On the other hand, what is logical is that the Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we find ourselves facing an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our differences in public debt increase to the extent of European business obligations, we do not have to worry.
If European differences were to decrease and our differences continued to increase, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators require most study services to anticipate their relaunch models and to revise their forecasts for 2011, with in addition the OECD and the European Commission, which are responsible with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not give much hope for their warning.
Again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the time being "safety is a mother of certainty".
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the sub-committee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán sketched for the press what he had referred to before the subcommittee, at eight-clos.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 billion until 2020 and EUR 60 billion more between that date and 2030, if nuclear power plants are to remain open today.
If that is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95 000.
On the other hand, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue changes, and power will need to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18 000 MW more are needed, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the proposed Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with the demands of his company, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate warming policies.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "pointual" measures, as the President of Iberdrola described them.
In any event, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, because they take some time before reaching their maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus handling market in ten airports
Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground airport services, will play the role of a privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, is five years long.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Board and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaborative protocol yesterday to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance provides for an investment of 20 million up to 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to carry out research on energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Exiona disputes her first motorway to Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Exiona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market on which she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The project is an estimated 1,700 million Australian dollars tunnel (about 1,047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A five-kilometre long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and concessionaire of highways.
The city's mayor wishes to have it available by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, within the framework of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their offers in May, the planned investment amounts to Australian $1,700 million (about EUR 1,047 million) and in the last phase there are three consortia, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in smooth, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first one is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second one, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European underground workers.
Against the team of Actona, the consortium Northern Direct was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield Infrastructure Manager and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, who in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large constructions and privatizations, but entering them is a major challenge, unless it is through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has just won a seat in this market by its 30% shareholding in Hochtief, Leighton's owner.
Assets millionaires
Actiona has placed on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a wide presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm in Victoria, Waubra (192 MW), and directs the grouping of companies responsible for setting up and managing the Adelaide desalination, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the building and infrastructure management markets.
The underground tollway, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and Northern Link (northern link), is called to connect the western highway of Toowong to the peripheral road to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the Administration indicates that the award will take place in the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll route will be opened for traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction site will be completed by 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide US$500 million (€308 million) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief widely fruitful, which yesterday mentioned obtaining a contract with the government valued at $154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national high-speed optical fibre network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have rapid access to the Internet and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company gave in to the construction project of the 27-storey King George Tower in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet begun and Hochtief concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, amounting to €64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having seen the work of expanding the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The construction is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Ms. Rushmore will be awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore, for a budget of approximately EUR 3 million per year, indicated the railway operator.
The contract refers to the possibility of two 12 month extensions each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that presented themselves to Renfe's call for tender, including four of which were finalists, including TBWA, who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million in France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of €63 million in France Télécom for its anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition on fixed and mobile telephone by signing exclusive agreements, by tariffs and by consumer loyalty programmes outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state enterprise, has accumulated more than EUR 450 million in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it poses to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore repeated.
An app store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephony subsidiary followed the wake-up of other operators and opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that did not come from voice transmission.
Initially, the Orange app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be necessary to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has reported 476,4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its inception
The League of Champions has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, which places them in third and fifth place of the clubs that cost the most money in this competition.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of the major clubs.
The competition allocated €5 362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third on the continent to make the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are the Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich, the two teams who also made the most money for their participation in the last League of Champions.
And that, although they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the League of Champions, although it has won more titles than any other country (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Out of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification games (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in excess of 550 00 euros for each of the games.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth final receive three million each, the eight teams that arrive in the fourth final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win nine million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
For example, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça took 2.5 million to win the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are spent.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four seats.
The previous year's champion is 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid on the basis of the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the offer to purchase shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force it to launch a public acquisition offer (OPA) for all securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share, which will be paid in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this carry-over.
Yesterday, Sos' shares finished at 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa's offer assesses the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual assessment of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV assured that it was not informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to take place, the disbursement would amount to $611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is $254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues the restructuring of his leadership.
In an attempt to stay out of possible offers of buying and going and coming justices from its former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as internal audit director.
A decision that makes it the first woman to hold a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created post that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos reveals new diversions of funds cannot be ruled out.
With regard to credit to Salazar, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorises Paternina's Exclusion OP presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were consistent with the current standards and considered "sufficient" the content of the explanatory sheet submitted, following the amendments applied on December 2.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were fixed, and that they could not in any way be transmitted prior to the completion of the tender, which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are reduced to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex work.
Calculate by hand the cost of repairing between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the most recent computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of experts use such systems.
Providers of services and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance devote themselves to the collection of information provided by manufacturers and then process them and offer them to their clients in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American Solara Group, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of sector assessment and information development tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years, more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes out of the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard job, because we need to catalogue each of the thousand pieces of the vehicle and register its price.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image of each model can be used on the various parts of a tourist car.
If this is a model sold massively, the work can be ready in a week if the process moves very quickly.
If this is a low-sales car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has full information of 99.2% of cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsches, but not the Ferraris or Lamborghini.
With respect to vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audatex has eight centres throughout the world (in Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each one specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than 100 technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million each year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer various products.
The most frequent application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the countries, there are also tools for managing cashiers or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide to the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but it does it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution, for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is EUR 5.75, for customers who use it little, not more than ten times a month.
Next, each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the assembly chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and Auda Subastas is an open server to the professional sector on the Internet that makes it expensive on vehicles declared to be wrecked.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geo-demographic analyses or know the current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given trade mark went to the garage for a failure or how many severe accidents occurred for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.

Four-step garage device
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a quote in only four steps: identifying the vehicle, looking for the replacement part, creating a quote and generating it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are responsive to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 of tourism, 109 all-terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears then the necessary piece is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, increments or reductions, and then can print the quote to give it back to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which may be credited.
Currently, the Audatex company is working to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that the mechanics see as a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
