members of the Majelis (AM) Welsh are worried if they look like a muppets' doll.
There is concern among some AM about a suggestion that they should be called MWPs.
This is due to a plan to change the name of the Majelis to the Welsh Parliament.
The AMs all over the political spectrum are worried if it can invite excitement.
An AM worker party said that his group was concerned, "It's called a Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
One member of the assembly (AM) said that his group as one unit, felt "not happy" and had proposed some alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open-minded" about a change of name, but judging that it was a fuck-up from the MWP abbreviation to Muppet.
In this context your letters in Welsh are spoken like the letters u in English Yorkshire.
"The final decision on any explanation of the words for the AMs is of course a problem for the members themselves."
Wales ’ 2017 decision gave the Mayor of Wales the authority to change his name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on a known proposal for broad support to refer to the Welsh Parliament as the Assembly.
Regarding issues called the AMs, the Commission preferred WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members) but the MWP option gained the greatest support for public consultation.
The AMs seem to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can disqualify the president, Elin Jones, who was expected to hand over the bill's plans for a few weeks.
These reforms will include other changes on how to work together, including the rules of disqualification for the AMs and committee system plans.
The AMs will get the final voice on the question of how they should be called when they discuss the laws.
The Macedonians went to give a voice to the referendum on the change of country names
The voter owners will decide whether their country name will be changed to "Northern Republic of Macedonia."
The celebrated vote was held in an effort to settle disputes for a decade with the Greek neighboring country, which also had a province called Macedonia.
Athena has long argued that the name of the neighboring country to the north shows a confession to her territory and has repeatedly rejected the offer of the European Union and NATO membership.
President Macedonia Gjorge Ibanov, a voice caller for a change of name, has said that he would ignore the voter.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, felt that the change of name was a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St.Martin's bells don't listen when the churches in Harlem are in trouble
"Historically, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adam.
"Today, there's no one."
He said that missing all the bars could be understood.
"People are socializing in another way" right now, he says.
"The bar is no longer a public guest room around where people visit it regularly."
As well as the church, he's worried that money from the sale of assets won't last long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they'll come back from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could have been replaced by an apartment building with a condominium filled with people who wouldn't help keep the sacred places around him.
"Most people who will buy condominium in these buildings are white people," he said, "and therefore will speed up the day when these churches close together because it is impossible for those who move to the condominium to become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white churches before Harlem became the city of black metropolis - Metropolitan Communities in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white-skinned Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
The black congregations that have served in the surrounding area have taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black church under the head of Reverend John Howard, who led a boycott of the retailer on 125th Street, the main road to shop in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
Fire in 1939 was a major damage to the building, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson were planning to rebuild, they built a tower bell.
Reverend David Johnson, Prince Johnson's son and his replacement in St. Martin proudly calls the tower bell "The poor folk bell"
An expert who played the tower bell in July gave him another name: "A treasure of culture" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
An expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also noted that this is the first tower bell in the world played by black musicians, Dionysio A. Lind, who played the largest tower bell in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in Santo Martin in the past few months is a complex architectural and contractor story, some brought by public church leaders, and the others by the Episcopal diocese.
Westry's bodies of government, which are made up of the leaders of the public - write a letter to the diocese in July with concern that the institution "will endeavour to burden costs" on the archives, although the archives are not involved in architectural recruitment and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some parish communities complain of the lack of transparency from the bishops.
Sharks hurt teenagers 13 years old in lobster dives in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch lobsters in California at the lobby opening, accused an officer.
The attack occurred before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy ask for help and then rowing in groups to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a memory of joy after catching the lobster, but then he "discovered" that the boy screamed, 'I was bitten!
I'm bitten!'
The whole cell bones are broken," Hammel said that he realized it when he reached the child.
“ I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘ There is a shark in the water! ’ ” Hammel adds.
The boy was flown to Rady's Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was treated in critical condition.
Shark species responsible for the attack are unknown.
Captain Larry Giles Beach Rescuer said in the media conference that a shark had been seen in that area a week earlier, but it was categorized as an harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles realized that there are over 135 shark species in this area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sciencebury's plan broke into the British beauty market
Sciencebury takes over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with a beautiful toss-style kiosk run by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial boost to the British beauty market worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while sales of fashion products and household equipment decreases, the biggest beauty kiosks will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more stores next year if it proves successful.
Investment in beauty becomes a hunting facility for supermarkets to use shelves used as a TV, microwave, and household appliances.
Sciencebury said that it would double the offer of beauty up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current brand range starts from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with a branded area like that found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched its product makeup scheme so that most of its products would be friendly to vegans - something that the young marketers are increasingly interested in.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfumer will test the performance of two Sainsbury stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London last week, while the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, at the end of this year.
Shopping online and switching it on food needs daily in small amounts at local grocery stores means that the supermarket has to do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive head of Sainsbury, has said that the fasts will become more and more like the mall as the supermarket chain tries to fight back the exploits like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and more non-food service.
Sainsbury has put the Argos trades on hundreds of stores and has also introduced some Habitats since they bought both of those two years ago, which he said has supported the sale of daily food and making more profitable acquisitions.
The previous supermarket's attempt to renovate the beauty and pharmacy department ended with failure.
Sciencebury tested the attempts of the image with Boots in early 2000, but the same work ended after there was a conflict on how to share the profits of the chemical store in the supermarket.
A new strategy emerged after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy, worth £125 million, three years ago.
It was announced that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a variety of fancy skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director Sainsbury, said: "We've changed the look and nuance on the beauty kiosks to fix the mood for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brand lines are designed to suit all the needs, the environs and comfortable locations that indicate that we are now being a binding goal that challenges the long-term shopping."
Peter Jones 'run' after Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a £11 million deal
Star Dragons Den, Peter Jones went ‘with rage’ after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a £11 million-dollar business-style deal to focus on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to manage the trademark of their household appliances and accessories, Truly.
This couple business is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of this morning, using his Instagram account to announce that he's out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons star" Den, Petes Jones is angry at pulling himself in the last few moments, from their profitable lifestyle business - to focus on his larger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source states that Jones was so "slow" when the golden girl TV admitted during the exciting meeting on Tuesday at her business center office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth up to £1.5 million - means she doesn't have enough time to devote herself to the trademark of their household appliances and accessories, Truly.
Their business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's wealth to £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones flew away from Britannia to one of his vacation homes,
One source says, "Thruly so far is Holly's most important priority.
That was going to be the long-term future, which would make it last for several decades to come.
His decision to stand down made everyone involved very uncomfortable.
No one will believe what happened on that Tuesday.
There's a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's main office ready for sale."
Experts believe the departure of this morning's host, one of the most expensive British stars, could damage the company to millions of dollars due to a large investment in the form of products, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household equipment, as well as the potential for further launch.
And this can mean the end of long-standing friendships.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, aged 52, was in charge in March.
This couple on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent stock at Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be ambassador to M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host to the I'm A Celebrity I'm.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on this business relationship."
Speaking seriously 'and then we fell in love'
He's joking about the criticism he's going to get from the news because he makes comments that some people view as "non-presidential" and has been very positive toward North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with his "newsreader" squeal.
"I didn't give up anything."
He knew that Kim was interested in meeting twice after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as a step forward for the North Korea decrimination.
But negotiation negotiations have been stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the highest diplomat in North Korea Ri Yong Ho spoke to the leaders of the world in. The General Council of the United Nations on Saturday that North Korea did not see the "adequate response" of the United States to the early wave of arms violations of North Korea.
On the contrary, he noted, the United States continued its sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump's got a more optimistic view of his speech.
"We do our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this extraordinary relationship,"
He said that his success in improving relations with Kim has brought positive results - stopping rocket experiments, helping to free the hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relationship with Kim.
"Very easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 outsiders trying to get into this dreary arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing towards the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami Indonesia and the Earthquake Destroyed an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population has lost their homes, there is no declaration of national disasters, as a precondition for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've made it clear that they're not asking for international help, so it's a bit challenging," said Mrs. Suunke.
While Save The Children is setting up a team to leave for the Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesperson for the national disaster department, said that the Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in the Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute aid.
In view of Indonesia’s continuing global turmoil, this country is still very unprepared to deal with natural anger.
While the tsunami shelter was built in Aceh, it was not a public sight on the other shoreline.
There are no tsunami sirens in the Palu, although warnings have been made, it is likely that they have contributed to the death toll.
At the best of times, the journey between many Indonesian islands is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The nursing hospital that has been located in Lombok to care for the victims of an earthquake on their way to the Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made repairs to Indonesia's infrastructure as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on the construction of highways and railway tracks.
But lack of funds has disturbed Mr. Joko's government while he faced the re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faced the pressure of ongoing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated from their homes when Muslim and Christian troops fought on the streets, using umbrellas, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Witness: Liverpool Player Daniel Sturridge entered a balancer goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat against Chelsea on the Premier League with a score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received bait from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from outside Chelsea's gallows when his team left 1-0.
He put the ball on his left side before kicking him toward the far pole.
The ball bound high on top of the gallows when the ball bounds to the right corner of the net.
The ball eventually fell across the Arrizabalaga's father who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think too much about it, and just kick it."
Chelsea led with a 1-0 score in the first half after the Belgian play of Eden Hazard scored goal in the 25th minute.

The victim died from the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The death victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia had increased to 832 people, according to the state disaster agency on Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the ruins of a 7,5 - magnitude earthquake that struck the Richter scale on Friday and triggered 20 - foot - tall waves, says Sutopo Purwo, the agency spokesperson at a press conference.
The tree city, which inhabits more than 380,000 souls, is filled with debris that collapses.

The statue of the Cromwell Parliament became the last memorial of the "rewriting history"
It will be a poetic justice for the destruction of many British cultural and religious artifacts by fanatic Puritans.
But Cromwell's people described Mr. Crick's advice as "foolish" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: "This cannot be avoided in the current debate about the destruction of statues, that figure Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster palace will be targeted.
English brother war iconoclasses are not ordered or done by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell descendants would be sacrificed for Thomas' ancestors' actions the previous century.
The extraordinary representation of Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure still believed by many to be worthy of celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of external pressure, in the case of course the kingdom.
Whether it's a completely accurate representation, it's still the subject of ongoing historical debate.
Certainly, the conflict in the mid - 17th century has shaped the next nation's development, and Cromwell is a figure that can be recognized by individual representing one side of the difference.
The success of the Lord of Protection is also worthy of celebration and remembrance."
Killer Pigs Hunting Chinese Farmers to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeast Chinese market, according to the local media report.
The man, identified only by the Marga name "Yuan", was found to have died of a broken artery, covered in blood near a pig cage in the Liupanshui market of the province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in the Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have gone with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the door of the pig cage near him has been opened.
He said that in the pighouse there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research has confirmed that the male pig with a weight of 550 pounds has persecuted the farmer to death, according to the report.
"Betis my cousin bled and destroyed," said the cousin who was known for the Marga "Wu", as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was already locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities were reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attack on humans have also occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
10 years before, a pig weighing 650 pounds shoved a Welsh farmer into his tractor until the wife frightened and expelled the animal.
After a farmer Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were usually not aggressive but the aroma of blood could act as "negotiators".
"They're just messing around.
They're biters, very curious to know... they're not going out to hurt you.
You just need to give him enough respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's storms bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States.
As expected, Rosa’s storm weakened as it moved over the cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
In any case, Rosa would have rained all over Mexico’s northern and southwest parts of the United States a few days to come.
Rosa had a wind at 85 mph, a Category 1 storm, starting at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday in the East, and located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa may have moved north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Palung began to form over the Pacific Ocean and moved east toward the U.S. West Coast, as Rosa approached the border of the California Bay on Monday as a tropical storm and began pushing the tropical rains northward to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring rain up to 10 inches in part of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropics of moisture that interacts with the approaching bead will create heavy rains in the West of São Paulo for several days to come.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause the dry rain level to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour at some points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is estimated that 2 to 4 inches of rain fall in some parts of Western Day, especially in most Arizona.
The storm likely occurred with a rapidly deteriorating condition because of the widespread tropical rain.
It is highly uninvited to explore the desert by walking on foot because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause the chaff to become violent rivers and stormy local winds and strong dust.
The approaching cliff will cause heavy local rain to part of the coast of Southern California.
Total rainfall that exceeds half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and the highway to slick.
It's going to be the first rain in that area in their rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and Monday morning, before the rains become wider on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains would spread to four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some great changes in temperature throughout the United States when the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropical area remains quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature within a short distance.
There is a precise example of the dramatic temperature difference throughout the U.S. central area on Sundays.
There's a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the remaining summer heat will be formed and spread again.
Most parts of the U.S. central and eastern region are expected to start warm in October with an 80s speed spread from the South plain to parts of the East Sea.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast showed a high chance for above average temperatures for the eastern U.S. until mid-October.
Over 20 million people have witnessed Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by the future Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who was accused of the alleged sexual violence in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, political failures continued, with publishers who suspended a regular event to announce an unexpected event in the last minute of Friday: A deal designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that the woman was 100 percent convinced that Cavanaugh was getting drunk and trying to take off her clothes at the High School party.
Cavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
Probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company is counting average viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Calculations for other networks that broadcast this are not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually experiences difficulties in counting the number of people who see him at the office.
To put this in perspective, it's the number of viewers that's almost the same as the playoff football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose host opinion strongly supports Kavanaugh's performance, excels all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the whole day, says Nielsen.
ABC ranks second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
Interest remains high after trial.
Flake was the key figure in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican Party office made a statement that he would choose to support Kavanaugh, he was arrested by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning by the taste pointer when he tried to climb the elevator to the Justice Committee.
He's standing down for a few minutes when he's being insulted by maki, being broadcast directly at CNN.
"I stand right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think that he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power when there are many helpless women.''"
Flake said that her office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that there was much more to be said in the committee congregation.
The cable TV and the broadcast network all went directly over a few hours later, when the Justice Committee would choose to advance Kavanaugh's candidacy throughout the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do that with the understanding that the FBI would check the charges against the candidate for a next week, as requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake has been assured some of the conversation with his friend, Senator Democrat Chris Coons.
After the conversation with Coons and some senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has power, because it's clear that the Republican party won't have a voice to approve Kavanaugh without any investigation.
President Trump has opened the FBI investigation into the charge of Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critic of playing politics over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses criticism of "playing politics" with Britain's future and damaging national interests, on his plan to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one interview that featured it on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed the attack on what he called the Chequers plan for Brexit, said that the proposal about England and the EU that must gather the tariffs for each other was "very unreasonable."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police captured suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU's death.
Police have captured a suspect in a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20 - year - old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and imprisoned on charges of murder level two, says Baton Rouge Police Department.
The officer released a video confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his eyeglasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said that they found Simpson's DNA on the stuff, the WAFB CBS affiliate reported.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said that he confessed to making a fatal shooting at Wayde.
The contract has been set at $350,000, the lawyer's report.
Coroner's East Baton Rouge parish office released an advance report on Friday, saying that the cause of death is a head-to-head gunshot wound to the neck.
The department thanks to the defiant defiance group of Louisiana State Police, state police labs, Southern University police and citizens around to assist in the investigation that leads to arrest.
Athical director LSU Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement for the "reliance and search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old then.
With a height of 6.6 feet living in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
His average score is 5.6 and he's bound up to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, basketball coach LSU Will Wade said his team felt "broken" and "shocked" with Wayde's death.
'This is what you worry about all the time,' said Wade.
The volcano pours ash in Mexico City
Abu’s exit from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the network and registered already 183 gas and ash emissions within a period of more than 24 hours.
The center monitors a number of shakes and vibrations.
The images on social media show a thin layer of ash hanging on the front glass of a car around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted the increase in activity in volcanoes 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital city since the 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
This volcano is known as the "Don Goyo" that has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatist towards the election of independence.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-freedom demonstration clashed with the anti-huru-hara police, and when thousands joined the rival demonstration to mark Catalonia's first polarization vote on self-separation.
A group of pro-separatist masks held by the anti-huru hara police toss them with eggs and throw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually filled by tourists.
An argument also occurred after that day with the police who used their stick to control the dispute.
For a few hours the pro-freedom groups shouted "No forget, no forgiveness" in the face of the signaler of the workers' union shouting, "Spanish Life."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries obtained in the protest, the local press reported.
Tension remained high in this media - oriented region, a year after the referendum of October 1, which Madrid considered illegal but celebrated by Catalan separatist.
The voters chose to be free, despite the low number of voters who opposed the separation and most of them boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were wounded last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the entire region of the GST in a severe conflict.
Pro-freedom groups have camped all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support the national police.
Demonstration continued but forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's prospect of independence.
"Then we went through one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out for choice, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having won a vital victory even a little in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-freedom parties have fought to maintain this year's moment though many of their well-known leaders, who are in exile or in detention awaiting trial, on their role in organizing referendums and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who recorded a protest with his phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"Now it's getting hotter," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been imprisoned for pre-trials since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the election of the European Parliament next year.
"Standing up as a candidate for the European election is the best way to condemn poverty in the values of democracy and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

The goal written by Menga has given victory to Livingston over Rangers with a 1-0 score
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston ensures victory
Livingston's victory led the Rangers to fire Steven Gerrard from his position as the manager of the Bemox club, on both defeats in 18 games.
The Dolly Attack has been evidence of a difference when Gary Holt's side movement is equal to the Hibernian in the second order.
The Gerrard side remains without victory in this season's Premiership and faces the head of Hearts who stands eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Earlier, Rangers met Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, in the meantime, extended their invincible record in division to six games, while Holt's coach's head has been racing since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost his chance against a sloppy guest team
The Holt team was supposed to be superior long before they scored goals, with their accuracy giving Rangers various difficulties.
Scott Robinson broke through but his attempt missed across the gallows, then Alan Lithgow could only widen his efforts after launching in and out of the cracks of Craig Halkett from across the gallows.
The host feels satisfied to allow Rangers to play great at first, to know that they can make it difficult for the incoming team to cope with the deathball.
And that's how to achieve a very important goal.
Rangers broke free kicks and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got a turn and scored goals from the middle of the field.
At that stage, Rangers have dominated the rulers but realize that the defense of the host can't be breached and Liam Kelly's Kiper is completely unconcerned,
The pattern continued until the second round, although Alfredo Morelos managed to fish for Kelly's rescue.
Scott Pittman was stabbed by the foot guard Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow are far removed from the other Livingston game tactics.
The attack continued to come to Livingston's gallows and constantly settled, while two criminal claims--after the Halkett challenge on Glenn Middleton's replacement player, and one for handball--refused.
'Fenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont by Tony Macaroni Arena
Performance and phenomenal results for Livingston.
For a man, they are amazing, they go beyond hope on this ever - rising route.
The play style and their staff have almost not changed since they went back to the top board, but large credits must be given to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He has so many champs.
Captain Halkett is very large, leading well-organized defense, while making Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall remain vigilant during the game.
Nevertheless, Rangers lack inspiration.
As good as they were at the time below Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was less good - only once they could break the formation of the host - and it was a warning to Rangers, who realized their existence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne.
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
They disagree about issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne to open a new great mosque.
This city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cite security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters move around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan prosthetics - many of them Kurds - also speaking, protesting both, Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him in that country.
The protest of resistance describes a conflict over the existence of an intruder who was welcomed as a hero by some Germans and was tried as a dictator by others.
Deptford highway crash: Drivers of bicycles killed in collisions with cars
A biker was killed in a collision that involved a car in London.
Strikes are taking place near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of town, about 10:15 BST.
The driver had stopped and the paramedics came, but the guy died in the scene.
A crash took place months after another biker died in a crash at Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan police say that the officers are trying to identify the man and report to his family.
The road was closed and the bus track was diverted and motorists were taken to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six wounded officers in the storms
Six wardens were injured in a riot in a man's prison with strict guard, the airfield said.
The chaos in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire was about 9:30 a.m. BST (GMT+0100) on Sunday and continues on.
The Tornado Special Officer has been directed to deal with the riots, which involve eight prisoners and occur on one side of the building.
The officers were treated at the scene because of slight injuries to the face.
A prison spokesperson said: "Specially trained flight attendants have been directed to deal with an incident that is taking place in the Long Lartin HMP prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We did not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that the responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend a longer time behind iron bars."
The Long Lartin HMP prison accommodates more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the prison chief was treated in the hospital after an inmate attacked.
And in October last year, the anti-huru-hara officers were called to prison to deal with serious riots where a fireman was attacked with a bile ball.
Rosa Storm Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Bandang Flood
Tropic depression that hit Arizona rarely occurs, but that's what's likely to happen next week because of the energy footprints of the Rosa storm left across the southwest desert, causing the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning that floods were raging on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona to South Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa was thought to be heading straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, hitting on Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix mentions in twitter that there is only "ten tropical storms capable of causing tropical storms or state of depression in 200 miles Phoenix region since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm in 40 miles border area AZ."
The latest storm power plant is capable of predicting 2 to 4 inches of isolated rainfall that reaches 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Other southwest desert areas include Rockies and Great Basin power plants are likely to be affected by 1 to 2 inches, with a possible 4 - inch isolation rate.
For those in the unrestricted flood zone, Rosa’s rain may be a blessing because of the drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, this part of the rainfall is likely to be beneficial because today the southwest is being sunk.
According to the U.S. United States Drought Observer, only about 40 percent of Arizona's region suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category,"weather.com reported.
First, the route through the Rosa Storm leads to land across the California Bay on the Mexican peninsula.
Rosa, still at storm power on Sunday morning at wind speeds 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at speeds of 12 miles per hour.
The storm met the colder waters in the Pacific, and that's why it's weakening its power.
Hence, it is expected to land in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or night.
The rainfall may be high in part of Mexico, causing a high flood risk
"Total rain white 3 to 6 inches is estimated to reach Baja California to southwestern Sonora, probably up to 10 inches," saidweather.com.
Then Rosa would cross the northern part of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which would cross through Arizona and south Utah on the middle of the night.
"The main risk that Rosa storms might pose or the rest of the storms is a very high rainfall in Baja California, the southwest of Sonora, and the U.S. westwestern U.S. desert," National Storm Center (NHC) states.
The rain is expected to cause flood and debris of buildings flowing into the deserts, and the terrain of the mountains.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Arrest four suspects attempted murder
Three teenage men and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a stab wound in Somerset.
The young man was found wounded in the area of Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He's taken to the hospital where he's in stable condition.
A 17 - year - old youth, two 18 - year - olds and a 20 - year - old man were arrested last night in Radstock, Avon, and Somerset, says the police.
Officers are calling out to anyone who might have the video footage of the incident on his cell phone to come and report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh ‘receives hatred and anger’ from the Democratic Party
"One voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for rejecting the cruel and shameful Democratic Party," said Trump on a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "receives hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party during the process of tying
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forced and emotionally denied a charge by Christine Blasey Ford that she had committed sexual violence to him several decades ago while they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the intelligence and quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"One voice of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reinforce someone who has the most perfect thinking of law in our time, a jury with a record of true public servants," he said to the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The President implicitly refers to Kavanaugh's candidacy as he talks about the importance of the participation of the Republic in the middle of the election.
"Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really racing," he said.
"That's why I went there to come, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argued that Democrat is on a mission to "block and block."
The first voter procedure at the Senate level in Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to be carried out at the latest on Friday, an assistant senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds of people died from an earthquake in Indonesia, the tsunami, with an increasing number of victims.
A few 384 people were killed, many of them drowned when a giant wave hit the beach, when a terrible earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia’s island of Sulawesis, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when the waves were six feet (18 feet) to destroy the beach in the evening, resulting in a lot of death and destruction.
Tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and didn't run so fast that they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the Disaster Relief Agency (BNPB) said at a time of tacitity in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, timber, houses, crawled everything on the ground," says Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before setting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to save themselves from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of service in the tree.
The air - pictures produced by BNPB illustrate many buildings and shops that were destroyed, crooked bridges and ambers, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The quakes continued to shake the city along the coast on Saturday.
The earthquake is felt in 2.4 million people.
The BPPT said in a statement that energy emitted on the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb force dropped in Hiroshima in the Second World War.
The city’s geography, which lies at the tip of a narrow bay, can increase the size of the tsunami, can be said to be.
Nugroho describes the damage that has occurred as "extensive" and states that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
Some victims were found trapped under the ruins of a damaged building, he said, adding that there were 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho says that the victim and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 mi) north of the Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Communication's really paralyzed with no information from Donggala, says Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers are heading to the region affected by the disaster.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get worse," he said.
The forum on Saturday received many criticisms because it did not inform us that there was a tsunami in the tree, although the authorities said that the waves were on the alert.
An amateur tape distributed on social media shows a man on the floor on a building sounding a warning with panic about a tsunami approaching, towards people on the streets below.
In a minute a roll of water hits the beach, disperses buildings and cars.
Reuters can't immediately prove the original footage.
Earthquakes and tsunamis are the biggest cause of the electrical heating that shuts down communication around the Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
The military has already begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities say, but refugees still need food and other basic needs.
The Air City has been reopened just to channel relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center at the Palu on Sunday.
The victim of Tsunami Indonesia has increased over 800.
That's awful.
When World Vision officials from Donggala made it to safety in the city of Palu, where they protected them in the tent of the best cloth that was built in their offices, on their way they had passed through various rotten areas, says Father Dosebah.
"They tell me they've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's awful.
Even when relief groups began to move slowly to start disaster relief activities, some of them complained about the attacks on foreign volunteers who had skills, who were to leave for the Palu.
According to Indonesia’s rules, funding, overseas supplies and energy can only begin to be provided if the affected area has been officially declared a national disaster region.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, the spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"At the moment the government says, OK, this is a national disaster," we can accept international help, but there is no such status."
On the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and family of the missing victims still hope that those whom they love will be part of the miracle that will fix the story of the tragic natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was released from the glass.
On Sunday, the rescuer took out a woman who had been stuck under a rubble for two days with the mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesian national paralysing team coach, has been a coach for two missing paralysed athletes, who were able to follow the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those who are still trapped at the Roa-Roa Hotel, with Father Mandagi, are his disciples.
"As a senior in the field of paralyzing, I have my personal emotional burdens," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me again how after the news of the Roa-Roa Hotel that was destroyed traveling around the paralympic community, he was desperate to send a message to the Palu competitors, who also participated in the celebration on the beach.
Even so, all the messages, had only one sign of the ashes, rather than two blues.
"I think it means no message sent," she said.
The robber took $26,750 during the ATM loading at Newport in Levee

Anyone who has information about their identity can contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
That rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announced the change of name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Formerly known as Kanye West."
West, aged 41, has had Ye's nickname for some time and uses it as its eighth album, released in June.
The change was made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande to perform at the show, which was cancelled because of the "emotional reason," said the creator of the show.
As a abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously said that for him the word had religious significance.
"I believe 'ye' is a common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you," said West earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with the publisher of Big Boy Radio.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that name is us.
That name was taken from Kanye, which means only one, to be Ye-- as a mirror of our goodness, our evils, our confusion, everything.
It's more of a mirror of our true self."
He was one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs in various ways has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announces his preference for Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a sign of liaison and big letters.
President Mexico, AMLO, swear not to use the military in the face of civil society
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn that he will never use military power against the civilian community to warn the 50th anniversary of the bloody action against the student.
Lopez Obrador promised the day on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to pressure the Mexicans."
Troops fired at the peaceful demonstration activity held in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time, when left wing students moved their roots across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has already guaranteed support for young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who are studying and opening up more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encourage young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. was supposed to double the A.I. fund.
Because China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should increase the amount of funds that will be used for research in that field, the word investor and practice A2 Kai-Fu Lee, who has been working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comment came after parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. overall lack of formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: to be number one in the AI innovation of 2030.
"Making AI research funds is a good start, considering all other countries tend to stay away from the U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
Multiplying funds can double opportunities so that the next major AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed the AI system that defeated the best American Othello player, and then he became an executive at Microsoft Research and Google's Chinese branch president.
Lee admitted that the U.S. government technology competition was like the Robotics Challenge for the New Defense Research Project and asked when the next activity would be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win the government's prize, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes over the academy; it's a company," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been employing college figures for AI research for the past few years.
Lee says that changing immigration policies can also help the U.S. to support AI's efforts.
"I think green cards can be offered automatically for PHD holders in AI," he said.
The Chinese Council issued the next-generation Science Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides funds for people in academic institutions as well as the way the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic tasks in China is lower, says Lee.
Early this year in the U.S. Department of Defense developed the Joint-Building Intelligence Center, which aims to involve industrial partners and academics, and the White Buildings announced the formation of the Committee's Selection for Steel Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announces a $2 billion investment in an initiative called the Next AI.
As for NSF, recently DARPA invested more than $100 million a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that called for the establishment of the National Security Commission for Earth Intelligence did not see any further action for months.
Macedonians make a vote in order to change the name of the country
The Macedonians made a vote on Sunday to decide to change the name of the country to "the Republic of North Macedonia," an action that would settle disputes for a decade with Greece that had already granted its membership to be part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains the view that the name of the neighbouring country on its north side represents a recognition of ownership of its territory and has banned it from joining the country with NATO and the European Union.
Both governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of a new name, but nationalist opposition argued that change would damage the identity of most ethnic population Slavia Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he wouldn't vote for the general election and a boycott campaign had raised doubts whether the results of the election could reach a minimum of 50 percent of the vote required for the election results to be declared legitimate.
The question is: "Do you agree to NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to get permission to enter the body like the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born of Yugoslavia's destruction.
"I came today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the young generation of Macedonia so that they could live free under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament say they will obey the vote to make decisions.
Change of name requires voice loss of two by three in parliament.
The National Election Commission says there's no report of violations until 1 p.m.
However, it turns out that voting results are only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliament elections in 2016 when 66 percent of voters registered their voice.
"I came to give my voice for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a picker at the capital, Skopje.
Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their voice to the public elections in Macedonia in order to change the country's name that would open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavarvarkov, 54 years old, has prepared a small stage and pulls chairs in front of tents made by those who will boycott the vote.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we wanted to join with honor, not through the maid's door," said Cavavarkov.
"We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can switch to China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO would bring more investments needed for Macedonia, which had a unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that most of the population will approve it because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," said Zaev after giving his voice.
He said the "yes" results will be "confirmed our future."
An opinion poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institution on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote - less than the number needed.
Another opinion, held by Telma Macedonia TV station, found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sundays.
Of them, 70 percent said they would choose yes.
In order for the vote to be successful, it takes 50 percent plus 1 vote.
A failure to vote will represent the first rejection of pro-Barat government policy since taking over in May last year.
Witness: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City explores all Brighton’s defenses to score goals.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were led as Brighton Defense on Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made that win look very easy on his score in the minutes to 65.
The Argentine striker received an operand in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three people defending Brighton, before he stepped into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green - necked people.
He turns past one man to defend before running ahead of some other opposites at the end of Brighton's gallows.
Then he ran to his left, to Sterling.
The British front gecko used his first kick from the gallows to operate the ball back to Aguero, which used his right foot to beat the Brighton kiper, Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the gallows.
"Aguero struggles with some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola Manager City to the reporter.
"We're talking about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
Sure enough, the young Bethelites have befriended Jacob.
We're glad he scored a goal at the time."
But Sterling gave Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal is in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, far into Brighton's territory at the game.
He's pumping the ball with a far kick that's glaring through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little kicking the ball before taking Sterling to the farthest post.
The front icehead Sky Blue pulled the ball towards the gallows just before the ball went out of the border.

Scherzer wants to get spoiler versus Rockies
With the elimination of Nationals from the playoffs, there is no reason to force another game.
But Scherzer's too competitive to expect to be able to take off Colorado Rockies at the game on Sundays, but only if there's still playoff involvement for Rockies, who excels in one match over Los Angeles Dodgers at NL West.
Rockies at least haven't got a place after winning in the wild-card game against Nationals by 5-2 on Friday night, but still trying to get their first division title.
"Although we play without winning, at least we can't figure out the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd of spectators and other teams that will compete at the highest level of any point that I may face this year.
How could I not want to compete in such a game?"
Nationals haven't announced the opening game for Sunday, but reported that in such a situation, they tend to let Scherzer join the match.
Scherzer, who's going to start a lab for 34 times, having a practice session on Thursday and starting a Sunday game that's usually used to get some rest.
Pitcher's right-hand Washington is an 18-7 scorer with an average run (ERA) 2.53 and 300 strike-out in 220 2/3 inning this session.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The president referred in a word to the situation of the future High Court judge's choice, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of the results of the Republicans' votes in the middle of the election.
"All our efforts were at stake in November.
Five weeks before it was carried out the most important election in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't really run that's why I'm fighting all over the place for an amazing candidate," she said.
Trump went on to say, "You've seen a radical democracy group that's really awful, you can see it's happening right now.
And they decided to take back power in any way, you see the crimes, their abuses.
They don't care who they hurt, who they should be beautiful in order to gain power and control, that's what they want, that's what they want, that's power and control, we won't give it to them."
Democrat, he said, was on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you saw it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "wrath and evil and evil and unbelief and unbelievable."
He referred to the Senate of Dianne Feinstein, who served on the Senate Court Committee by the name, which was warmly welcomed by her listeners.
"Remember what the answer is?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for it -- it's a very bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Power Party is no longer a public service place.
Now be intolerant to anyone who tells his mind
When Momentum activists at the local party gave me a voice to denounce myself, it wasn't surprising.
After all, I was in the final order of Members of Parliament, who were told that our presence was not expected — all because we expressed our views.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan got similar treatment because he stood up for anti-Semitism vigorously.
In my case, that rabid move criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, in national security, in Europe, the issue that is ironically the same as that of Jeremy Corbyn with the previous leader.
Notice for the meeting of the eastern Nottingham workers on Friday states that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For nearly eight years I became a member of the local Labour Parliament, a meeting of the General Committee on Friday evening was exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises about "better, more friendly" politics has not long been forgotten, if, indeed, it has begun.
Opinions in the labor party are becoming more and more intolerant and every opinion is judged by the party’s authority.
It began soon after Jeremy became the leader, as a colleague I thought would share the same political view, began to expect me to turn around and take a position that I would never have accepted - both in national security and the single European market.
Whenever I speak openly - and no matter what I say - then after that there will be a search in social media that calls for a cancellation of the show, reproaching the political center, told me I should not be serving in the Labour party.
And it's not just me who experienced it.
Of course, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because of comments directed to me tending to politics.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who face sexual abuse or racism every day but never avoid it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current political era is how much abuse has been considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party was supposed to help develop a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we're no longer in a wider church and with every "unbelief" motion or turn selection of party rules into more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that motivated me to keep my head down, not too loudly comment, and then I'd say, "All right."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Working Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by thatcher government’s payouts that literally caused my comprehensive school class to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public service for those who desperately need it - both as local counselors and ministers in the government.
I never hid my political actions, including the last election.
No one in Eastern Nottingham will question my policy position and things I don't agree with today's leadership.
For those who encourage the motion on Friday, what I can say is that when the country moves fast towards the division of sovereignty (Brexit), it will endanger the business of our country and our public service, I do not want to waste time and energy for loyalty to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constitution, as a member of the Labour Party or not.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes up to the top
The last two experiments may have been a little misleading the end results, but no doubt Ayr deserves to win the Tennant's Premiership game that's been very entertaining today.
Now they're in the top order, the only unbeatable side of ten.
In the end, their superior defenses, and the ability to achieve the best of opportunities, which made the host team and coach Peter Murchie have the right to feel happy.
"So far we've tested our game, and we're still invincible so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose says: "The prize for Ayr, they're better at taking chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but yellow cards for Captain Scotland Rory Hughes, given to the game by Warriors, give Melrose the chance to score and Jason Baggot hijack unaltered experiments.
Climo extended Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, right in the middle of time, he scored goals and then did a single attempt to make Ayr's score 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose began the second half well and the Patrick Anderson experiment, which Baggot modified, reduced the chances to five points.
Then there was a long pause because Ruaridh Knott had a serious wound, being held out, and since the beginning of the game, Ayr went faster than Stafford McDowall's experiment, modified by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then hit the yellow card and again, Melrose made a backup player pay with an unaltered Bruce Colvine experiment, at the end of the hard pressure.
The host has returned to play, though, when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for circling the unballed Climo, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived behind the advanced wounded Ayr.
Climo was replaced, as was the case again, almost from the beginning of the game, after Kyle Rowe had a win-win kick and thwarted the fifth effort of Gregor Henry.
The Star Still Game looks ready to run his new career in the restaurant industry.
The Star Still Game Kieran appears ready to move to the service industry after it was known that he was appointed as a director of a licensed restaurant.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis performer at the BBC's popular event, who was screened and also starred with the old comedian, Greg Hemphill.
The couple had announced that the nineth series that was coming was the last episode, and Kiernan was planning to drive the live broadcast after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he's Director Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a Scottish Sun narrative implied that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the "growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours: Bolivia surrounded by land hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific.
Sailors patrol the main base of the Roman legions, located in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue sea flag.
The Marine Camp from Titicaca to Amazon is polished with a motorcycle: "The sea is our rightful right.
To rise again is a duty."
Through Bolivia, surrounded by land, memories of the loss of a coastline to Chile in a 19th - century bloody conflict still clearly as a desire for once again to sail the Pacific Ocean.
Hope is likely to reach its peak in a few decades, for Bolivia is waiting for a ruling from the court on October 1, after a five - year trial.
"Bolivia has moments, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope for the outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ trial on wide screens across the country, hoping that the courts in Den Haag will support Bolivia’s demands that - after a few decades of extenuating elections -Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s guarantee of sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, President of Bolivia's native charisma facing a controversial war for next year's election - also has a lot of support for Monday's trial.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific Sea," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court can't decide Bolivia's wishes-- and it'll only change a little if it's possible.
The Netherlands based on the United Nations body has no power to hand over Chile, and it has already established that it will not decide the outcome of a possible dispute.
That the ICJ decree came only six months after the final argument had been heard, which indicated that the case was "uncomplex," said Paz Zárate, an international law expert in Chile.
And it's still far from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the last four years, it's probably just going to fall apart.
"The error of access to the sea has been hijacked by the Bolivian government now," said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has weakened the good manners of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at a certain point will remain in a concordance, but it will be very difficult to keep a conversation after this.
Both countries have not exchanged Ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian government vice president of Den Haag, rejected the idea of taking decisions quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia an "extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relationship with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales-still one of the most famous Latin American presidents-using maritime issues as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Sea," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see what we need to finish the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons are not going to happen unless they can trust the U.S.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho said his first country would never be able to disarm nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He mentioned that the United States made the deal that was made at the Singapore meeting between rival leaders.
His comment came up when Secretary of State A.S. Mike Pompeo saw almost starting nuclear diplomacy that had been deadlock for more than three months after a meeting with Kim Jong One from North Korea.
Ri says just a "your dream" that by continuing U.S. sanctions and rejection of the declaration of the Korean War settlement will cause North Korea to give up.
Washington is looking forward to approving the declaration without Pyongyang making an effort to stop the armed forces first.
Well, Kim and President of the U.S. Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
However, there is a widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the acknowledgement of the weapons warehouse that the country has become the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeii plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris mode shows show show a lot of recent cover-up collections up to the main road near you
If you want more hat collections or really want to be protected from sunlight don't look for anything else.
Designer Valentino and Thom Browne released a series of large-scale caps for their SS19 collection on stage fashion shows with a dazzling style held in Paris Fashion Week.
The really impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and these designers have shown an eye-catching creation on stage.
The notable thing about Valentino is a cream - colored hat that is embellished with the wide edges of the fur vat that covers the model’s head.
Large accessories include a bucket adorned with diamonds, a witch hat, and even a pineapple, but not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a bunch of weird-and-right masks towards Halloween.
Many masks of different colors his lips have been stitched and look like Hannibal Lecter compared to high couture.
A similar creation of scuba diving equipment is equipped with snorkels and glasses, while the others look like melted ice cream.
And if you keep going through the collection of the abs - then you're in good luck.
Modest observers estimate that the large hat collection will be placed on the main road near you.
Large hats become a very loose train in the ‘La Bomba’, straw hat with a two-legged edge is used all people including Rihanna until Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult of the label behind the hat that is very impractical the cracking of social media makes a great creation on the beach catwalks of the huge straw almost the same as the swimwear - used with a slender model.
The raffia bag burned, cut with raffia on the edge with white straps, is an outstanding feature of the collection Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity painter Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I hope to see the big hat and the beach bag arrive on the main road for the summer next--because the designer has made a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the request for the big accessory'
John Edward: Language skills are very important to global citizens
Scotland's private school kept track of academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with an extraordinary test, which was reinforced by every student and collective success in sports, art, music and hard work.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish School Council (SCIS) working hard to provide the best service for students and parents.
The independent school aims to prepare its students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the school curriculum as expected, we see that modern language continues to be the focus of popular choice and desired in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in the language he understands, your words will go into his head.
If you speak to him in his language, then your words will go into his heart."
It's a strong reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest test this year, we can see that language is the top position of the league table with the highest graduation value in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn foreign languages get A Plus.
The data, gathered from 74 SCIS schools that show that 72 percent of students gain A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French and 63 percent who learn Spanish also gain A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that will certainly be needed by children and teenagers in the future.
Today, languages, as an option of teaching, are held in the same standard as the STEM study (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematics) at the modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Ministry of Labor and Skills in 2014 found that for some reasons why the workers had to continue to struggle to fill the voids, 17 percent why language skills were lacking.
Thus, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare young people for their careers in the future.
As there is increased opportunity for more speaking skills, this quality is essential in the global world.
Whatever career choices a person has, if they have learned a second language, in the future they will feel the real benefit of having such a lifetime’s skills.
Being able to communicate directly with the people of a foreign country will automatically make a multilingual superior in competition.
According to YouGov’s opinion on more than 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak foreign language well enough to have French spoken and became the only language spoken in two digits, 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning for children today is important for the moment.
Having multi-language skills, especially the language of developing countries, will multiply children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on a more classical modern language, while others will teach the language that is considered the most important in England for the next few years, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that can be selected in the independent school, with the teaching staff of experts in this field.
Scotland's independent school is designed to provide the learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It cannot be ruled out that at present, in the global business environment, language will always be an important aspect of determining the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language must really be regarded as "international communication skills."
The independent school will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and superiority to Scottish teenagers.
We have to do this right.
John Edward is Director of Scotland's Board of Schools.
LeBron will run debut for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting for fans to see LeBron James set off his debut for Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing in the opening of the Spring Pre-Summer Day against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not been specified how many minutes he will play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote tweets that James might be playing for a few minutes.
After the initial exercise this week, James was asked about his plan for six Lakers Prefects.
"At the stage of my career right now, I don't have to do the pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trump General Meeting Schedule in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a general campaign meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first general meeting of five public meetings scheduled next week, including stopping in some fun places that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
After asserting that the vote was delayed so that he could choose to fill the Supreme Court’s office, Trump intended to build support for him for the upcoming public elections because the Republican Party risked losing control of Congress if voter elections were done in November.
What time was Trump's general meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's general meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia scheduled at 7 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's public meeting in West Virginia online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump's likely to discuss this week's trial for future Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which is becoming more tense after the accusation of dishonest sexual activity and the Senate's voter estimates will be postponed until a week while the FBI investigates it.
But the main purpose of this public meeting agenda is to help the Republican party to get a few moments in the face of the November general election.
Therefore, in President Trump's campaign, it is mentioned that five general meetings next week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters because the Republican party is trying to protect and expand the majority that they hold in the Senate and the DPR," says Reuters.
"Congress control is very important for his agenda so that the president will be as likely to travel to the states as long as we face the busy campaign season," Trump's campaign spokeswoman who refuses to mention his name to Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, a general meeting tonight is expected to provide support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the media from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second Trump visit to West Virginia in the last month, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, a West Virginia Senate candidate from the leftover Republican Party.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come as an effort to increase his winnings in opinions," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States team shows courage to stand up to the single game on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome session Saturday afternoon is probably needed in this Ryder Cup.
The momentum swings are a concept of sport that is a result of the complete trust of players, and nothing goes beyond this competition.
Where do they think they're at this moment?
"Before, they beat six points and now four, so I think we consider it a little bit of a moment," Jordan Spieth said while passing that day.
Certainly Europe has the advantage because it excels four points with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth said, felt they had a little momentum and they had many things that could be exciting, except for the Spieth and Justin Thomas formation that played together all day and each prided three out of four points.
Spieth has played deadlyly from the tee area to the green area and led with a grip.
The clamoring of the parachute is getting louder as the turn comes, doing a big putting blow to make a series match when he and Thomas lose two to two.
His puttling blow that won them at the number 15 received with a similar shout, a shout that tells you that he's convinced America didn't lose.
"You really should try harder and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
All these players have gone now.
18 holes need to be marked.
The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas for two days yesterday was Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unbeatable story from Ryder Cup.
A unique but interesting couple from Europe is four for four and can do it without mistake.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't do bogey punch on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seems to flow both to and from this rich crowd that convinces them that they are players to be defeated on Sundays, and no players more famous than Fleetwood or Molinari will seal the potential of Europe's victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
It's better if at the same time both are placed in a different hole.
Still, it is too early to talk about Europe’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson shorten Sergio Garcia's work, fourball hero in the morning, when he was installed with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the Nine front like digging holes that will never be climbed by Spanish and Swedish golfers.
Even though, on Sundays no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are a good show to see closer because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how strategies can change immediately.
So far, Europe has been playing better as a team and leading quite far to the final day, but the foursome session also shows that the US team has the guts to compete in the face of some doubts, especially in the United States.
European top 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of the final day of Ryder Cup after rising from the fourball and foursome games on Saturday by leading 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over Tiger Woods who had to fight to record their points so far in Le Golf National with four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to defend the trophies that didn't reach Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong American team in the morning fourball, made this series 3-1 result.
The United States is giving more resistance in foursomes, winning two games, but they can't reduce deficits.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points of the 12 single games on Sunday to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debut to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were called "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, only became the second pair to win four points of their four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in their fourballs they became very strong to defeat Woods who slammed and the American debut Bryson Dechambeau more firmly 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturday, once a brilliant performance, but he's already lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and sevens in a row.
Justin Rose, rest at fourball in the morning, then back to pair with Henrik Stenson in foursome and lose 2&1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranks one and three worlds.
Europe didn't reach it itself even though the day was fun and winding in the southwest of Paris.
The main winner three times Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a two-point measure for America on Saturday.
They won 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourball and then came back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in foursome after losing two holes first.
It just happened twice in the history of Ryder Cup where a team returned from the four-point deficit into the single game, although as a champion of the Furyk team just needed a serial point to maintain the trophy.
However, after becoming the second best for two days, the Sunday strike seems to be overrun by them.
North Korea says it's impossible to disarm a weapon in one side without trust.
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations of the continued sanctions on their disbelief in the United States and that it could not have partially disarmed its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Council of the world's annual body that North Korea had taken "significant steps that show good intentions" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, unblocking nuclear testing locations, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"No, we don't see a proper response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation we may not be able to disarm our own weapons first separately."
While Ri repeated the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the "progress" approach to denuclisation where North Korea would be punished for taking a step forward, a statement indicated that they did not completely reject what Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri refers to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the summit meeting between the United States President and North Korean officials who were first held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to pursue a "Korea-like settlement" while Trump promised North Korea security assurance.
North Korea has wanted the end of the Korean War 1950-53 officially, but the United States says Pyongyang should stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused to call for the release of international heavy sanctions in North Korea.
"United States insists on "pre-enactment" and increases pressure by giving semi-sanctions to achieve their goal by force, and even rejecting "the statement of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us bend our knees is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the constant punishment will deepen our disbelief."
Ri didn't mention a plan for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, which was hosted by the U.S. leaders of the United Nations earlier this week.
In fact, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leaders Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added, "If the problem side of this is South Korea and not the United States, the South Korea is not going to face this kind of dead end."
Nevertheless, Ri's speech tone was dramatically different from last year, when he spoke to the United Nations General Assembly that targeting North Korea rockets on U.S. soil was something that couldn't be avoided after "Mr. Devil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN meeting, Trump last year threatened to "break up" North Korea in total, praised Kim for her courage to take steps to disarm, but the great work still had to be done and the sanctions had to be done until North Korea did the denuclision.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months--no problem," he said.
The Chinese and Russians believe that the United Nations Security Council must punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, the Foreign Minister of the United States, Mike Pompeo, addressed the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must be continued with rigour and must not fail until we know that full, final and verified denukliization."
The Security Council in a round-up voice increased sanctions for North Korea since 2006 as an effort to stop the execution of nuclear programs and Pyongyang ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri in the ranks of the General Council of the United Nations and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had actually been progress, only North Korea in the hour's brink that he made "a charge like a gangster."
North Korea promises at a meeting with Moon this month to unload the missile site and also nuclear complex if the United States takes "the right action."
He stated that Kim told him to do "the right thing" with his wish is security assurance that Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students took a course on quite a break.
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all S1 students sleep more, in an effort to fight macho culture in learning that is developing through the 'man of the owls' with caffeine.
An academic found that students at university number one world often know nothing if they discuss a very basic thing about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep specialist medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed courses, which he believed were the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleepless study.
'In the end a girl came to me and said, 'Why have I just been told, in my final year?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleeping -- which surprises me,' she told The Telegraph.
This year’s first course, explains to the students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic outcomes, and improve their public well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding a very sleepy student all week.
The one - hour course involved a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there is a picture of the dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to find out about the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic results are influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleep routines.
On the other hand, participants were told how long sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with an interactive icon, then pushes participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know this won't change student behavior instantly.
But we're convinced that they have the right to know-- like you have the right to know the effect of choosing to suck cigarettes on health,' mother of Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride with 'abstaining' still exists, he said, in addition to that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students that means lack of sleep is a problem that continues to grow.
Make sure you sleep enough, with good quality, have to be 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, it learns - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep enables the brain to trigger hunger, causing continued hunger.
Raymond So, 19 - year - old Californian who studied chemistry and physical biology that helped Professor Czeisler design the course, had taken one of his classes last year at Harvard in the first year.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize a course for the entire college.
The next step, he hoped that the entire graduate student would be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting up sleep alarms, also wake-up alarms, and realize the effect of the ‘blue light’ emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, which can move your circidal rhythm out of its set path to cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga lower mental army Gerrard
Again, Rangers felt the sadness of the day in the cage when Dolly's attack drove a team of Steven Gerrards who had suffered a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Hemox team was trying to record their first win on their way, since 4-1 win in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team just gave Gerrard a second victory in 18 games as a manager, leaving his team eight points left by the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts class.
Attack seven minutes before the first round is over and the rangers who run out of logic don't seem to balance.
While Rangers now descend to sixth position, Livingston ascends to third position, leaving only a gap of goals from Hibernian.
And maybe there'll be more trouble in the Rangers' fortress after the Calum Spence guard has to be taken care of for a head injury after an object is thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that copied Ayr to the semifinal Betfred Cup.
Instead, Holt went with Livi 11 who took one point from Hearts last week and he'd be happy with the costumes that turned their opponents on every occasion.
Rangers may dominate the possession of the ball, but Livingston uses the ball they have better.
They should have recorded the score in just two minutes when the first short bait was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor, but the swing pulled the big chance too wide.
Jacobs' free kick in and then met Captain Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow's defense partner can only stab wide in the back.
Rangers take control but there seems to be more hope than confidence about their game in the third.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he was supposed to get a penalty when he and Steven Lawless crashed at a quarter-hour mark, but Steven Thomson's daughter refused the citizens of Colombia.
Rangers only managed to make two shots at the first round, but the previous Ibrax guard, Liam Kelly, hardly ever had any trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's headband and the easy-to-done Ovie Ejaria attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be opposed to the path of the game, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their own hard work.
Once again Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' dead ball tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm chose Menga for the simple end.
Gerrard acted when he rested by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and that change almost directly influenced when the wing player put the ball on Morelos but Kelly played impressively fast out of line to block.
But Livingston kept forcing the team to play exactly what games they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping all the long balls.
The Holt team was supposed to extend their excellence at the final stage but McGregor stood up well to drive Jacobs away before Lithgow rounded wide from the corner.
Rangers' replacement player, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty when he had a disagreement with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his face around.
Almanac: Geiger Breaker
And now from our "Sunday Morning" German page: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and it's still going to be the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, it was a discovery that eventually made the device called the Geiger Breaker.
As a scientific tool since then, Geiger's story is also a pop culture story, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring cowboy scientists who seem to be less convinced of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What kind of thing is that?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger divider, used to find radioactive mineral locations, like uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the atomic effect released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, it's coming up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But that discovery kept his name alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to ‘generate’ evil cells
The new cancer vaccine taught the immune system to 'know' evil cells and kill them.
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
The method involves the process of extracting immune cells from patients, changing them in the laboratory.
They can then 'generate' common proteins to many cancers and then inject again
A test vaccine shows promising results for patients with various types of cancer.
A woman was treated with the vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize a bad cell, her ovarian cancer was lost for more than 18 months.
This method involves the process of extracting the immune cells, changing them in the laboratory so they can "generate" proteins that are generally found in many cancers called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the United States National Cancer Agency at Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The fact is that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "pulses the growth of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and cholorectals, Prof. Berzofsky explains.
The same approach as taking immunosanitary cells and "teaching" to them the way cancer cells target has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West starts Diatribe Pro-Trump, wears MAGA hats, after the SNL look.
It's not going well.
Kanye West went to the studio during Saturday Night Live after a mess where he praised Donald Trump's President of the United States and said he'd be running for 2020.
After bringing the third song that night, called Ghost Town where he wore the make America Great hat, he challenged the Democratic party and repeated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yeah, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL started a show with a charade star named Matt Damon laughing at Brett Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate's Yudisial Committee on the sexual violence claim made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the West's peas tapes were uploaded to social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock is trying to make fun of the West with that upload.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble behind the stage because of the hat he wore.
"They slammed me behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They're taking me down!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sink?" said that he would wear Superman's coat, because that means you can't dictate what I should do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comment produces at least twice a nuisance from the audience and the SNL audience seems embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling him: "The entire studio is silent."
West was taken in the last few moments as a replacement for Ariana Grande's singer, former Mac Miller's rapist boyfriend who just died a few days ago.
West is confusing a lot of people with the performance of I Love it, dressed like Perrier's Bottle.
West was supported by the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who wrote tweets: "To one of the bravest souls: I'm sure you've had a good time."
But the host of Karen Hunter's show writes tweets that West just "became itself and it's really very good."
"But I chose not to provide a person (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his "art") who I believe to be at the side and to expose a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, said that he is now "an officially known Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapist, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course died of the legend of Prince's music, turned its name into a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.

The Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in a mid-century fantasy series full of violence from HBO Game of Thrones.
But this actor, 31, insists on stereotypes of male hero, he says that role on the screen of this kind often makes young boys feel that they must be strong to be honored.
Talk to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit says that he's convinced there's something wrong and question how to deal with bad masculinity issues in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who just married his opponent at the Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, claims he felt 'strong enough' to discuss the issue.
'I feel personally, strong enough, right now--where is our fault in this masculinity?' he said.
'What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the emergence of a bad masculinity with its very masculine characters.
He goes on to say, 'Where is the character of birth and what is taught?'
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel they have to have a certain side of this to be men?
I think it's really one of the big questions in this time - how do we change it?
'Cause obviously there's something wrong with the young people.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not play in the prekuel or the sequel Game of Thrones when this show would end next summer, saying that he was already 'completed with the battlefield and horses'.
Since November Kit will re-enact the True West of Sam Shepard, a story about the movie producer and his brother, who was a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to get out of the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so gave me the future family, and from here my life began' his word.
Rose played Ygritte, the character love flower Kit is Jon Snow, in the fantasy series winner of this Emmy award.
This couple got married in June 2018 in Leslie's homeland in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: Dogkok reports 14% of new cases
Thiongkok has announced 14% of its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected in this country, says a health officer.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are transmitted through sex, marking changes from before.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of Tiongkok as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who have HIV in this way has declined to almost zero, the Tiongkok health official said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Yet, from year to year the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in Thailand has increased to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the community of LGBT Tiongkok.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in Tiongkok in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is called increasing.
Because of the conservative value of this country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many diseases are derived from improper sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Tiongkok government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters contends that the staff has leaked Senator GOP's data, spread 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
The representative of Maxine Waters on Saturday protested that one of his staff had sent personal information to three U.S. Republican Senators on the Wikipedia page of Parliament members.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party confirms that the claim was moved by experts and the "ultra-right wing" website.
"False lies, lies, and many other disgusting lies," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
It was reported that the information that was released includes the home address and telephone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, sent by unknown people at Capitol Hill during the Senate panel session on the accusation of indecent sexual behavior against the future Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
This bocoran appeared shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that IP addresses that identify the source of the shipment are connected to the Waters office and reveal information from one of the Waters staff, Hill reports.
"This accusation is not based on the truth and is an absolute lie," further Waters.
"Member of my staff--identity, personal information, and safety are threatened because of the false and misconceptions--no responsibility for the leaking of this information.
This is a false accusation.
The Waters statement quickly draws online criticism, including the former Secretary of the White House Press, Ari Fleischer.
"This is anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This shows he doesn't fit to be a congressman.
A person who is falsely accused of something he or she does not commit is incapable of feeling angry.
They shouldn't be distracted.
They must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must be quiet and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Kavanaugh Judge, who accused critics of being too angry during the Thursday congregation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican party candidate who is trying to move Waters on a part-time election, also tweets his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true," he writes on Twitter.
In his statement, Water says his office has warned "the right authority and law enforcement entity about this wrong charge.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are damaging and dangerous to one and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Storyes Again - less good Rowan Atkinson spy parody
It's now looking for Brexit's significance in every new film with Britain's biased view is a tradition and it seems to be valid for the resurgence of Johnny English's larynx parodies - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcasm syndicate about how clearly bad we become a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, Johnny English, who looked at the muscles, the rubber face, and the uncompetent, has updated his license to screw up all things for the second time — his name has led more than anything that he is a vast comic creation designed for non - English - language cinema territory.
Of course he's a crazy secret agent who, despite his strange suspicion, has a little Clouseau character, a small character Mr Bean and a circle of wanderers who contributed a little note to the theme Chariots of Fire at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
Indeed, he is based on international mystery tourists and men who have been playing Atkinson at the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving the chaos behind him.
There's one or two sweet moments on this recent JE trip.
I like it when Johnny English comes near the helicopter by wearing a middle-century diaper and rotor handcuffs quickly sticking onto his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown, but his humor feels less powerful and too strange, especially when branding "serious" movies like 007 and Mission Impossible has been confident to enter comedies as materials.
It felt like it was meant for children rather than adults, and for me the strange Johnny English is not innovative and the focus of Atkinson's movies' jokes in Bean's personality.
The award that's been warm these years is that England is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a super-secret British spy web network, revealing the identity of all British agents in the field, to disappoint an agent on duty - unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for the proud and hostile prime minister, who has completely destroyed his popularity politically: Emma Thompson plays a very good role with the quasi-Teresa-May character but not much that can be taken from his manuscript.
His intelligent advisor provides information that since every active spy has been weakened, he must bring one out of retirement.
And that means the Johnny English kikuk himself, now employed as the principal in some fancy buildings, but giving a secret lesson on how to do the undercover operation: there are some nice jokes here, when English offers spy academy like the School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for emergency briefings and again united with a long-suffering old friend of Bough, told by Ben Miller again.
Bough's married now, getting a sub-commander, the top-class role of a bitch where Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin who made a mistake on His Majesty's Secret Agents are back in action, met with the mysterious beautiful woman of Ophelia Bulletova, whom Olga Kurylenko suggested.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is concerned about falling into the influence of the millionaires of charismatic technology that claims can solve the British computer problem: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough started their ridiculous adventures: undercover as servants, they burned up the fast French sajia restaurant; they made chaos by smuggled themselves into Volta's luxury ship; and English triggered anarchy when he tried to use the virtual reality headset to get used to Volta's interior.
All the stops are definitely pulled for the last sequence, but with hospitality and such a riot, there's a little TV channel for the kids that's all about it.
That's quite moderate.
And like the other Johnny English film, I can't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a really appropriate role for his talent?
Workers are planning plans for British citizens to work four days a week but are paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn of the Workers ’ Union considered the radical plan that wanted British citizens to work four days a week - but paid five days.
The union was reported to want the owners of the company to continue the capture through artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for the workers by giving them additional day off.
He'll let the employees enjoy the weekend of three days-- but still get the same pay.
Some sources say that the idea would be 'pass' with the party's economic agenda and plan to push the country to support the workers.
The four - day week transition has been approved by the British Trade Congress as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
One source, which is the senior of the Working Group, said to The Sunday Times: 'The emphasis on this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
'This won't happen overnight, but four days' work in a week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to balance the economy that supports the workers and the party industry's strategy as a whole.'
The Labour Party was not the first to support that idea, since the Green Party had promised four days of work a week in the 2017 public election campaign.
However, these aspirations are currently not supported by the entire Labour Party.
The speechist of the Labour Party said: 'Four working days in a week are not party policy and are not considered by the party.'
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to perfect his vision for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell said he's determined to regain power from the "anonymous director" and "students" at the utility company.
This shadow chancellor plan also means that current stockholders in the drinking water company may not be able to get their entire stock back because the government of the Labour Party can do 'refund' for the reason of the violation they feel.
He also made sure his plan to put the workers in the company board and create the Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to employees, who would meet the annual dividend up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their view.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his candidacy in the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised questions as to whether the findings of this office could affect the senators of the Republican Party to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Senator of the Republic Party, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their mind.
Looks like Kennedy's more open than his South Carolina partner.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'd attend the trial, I said, I've already spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the charge came up, and said, 'You did it?'
He's a firm, determined, firm man."
However, Graham’s voice may not seem to be able to change.
"My mind has decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but what I know is: Brett strongly disagrees with him," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he mentioned cannot verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the meaning of the Global Citizen Festival and has this event been doing something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will be holding the Global Citizen Festival, a annual music event that shows the stars that are performing very impressively, and a mission that is also effective; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, Global Citizen Festival will be the witness of tens of thousands of people coming to Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the purpose of this event that is actually ending extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay a VIP ticket), concert visitors must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing the world's leaders, calling, or other ways that will help raise awareness of their goals to end poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal over the past 12 years?
Is the idea of giving a free concert the right way to ask people to do something, or is it just another case called "clickivism" - people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, spurred on to set another goal.
It is said that this action has helped trigger world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will influence more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group has collected 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, at least $10 billion of them have been channelled or made fundraising.
This group estimates that the funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some major commitments among others The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership made up of investors and performers committed to "helping children grow to their maximum potential," promised to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end the country's lack of nutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the British government, the donors, the national government, and the Global Citizen like you, we can make social injustice of this lack of nutrition a record of history," Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman told the crowd of people at the London live concert in April 2018.
This group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to increase nutrition for mothers and children in England, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Answering one of the questions in General Question on their website that asks "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizen said, "It's going to be a long and difficult road--sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, like civil rights and great anti-apartheid movements that have existed before us, we will succeed, because if we unite, we will grow stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the stars that appeared on this New York show, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy as a "blockade" to hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of State
"If necessary" Washington could ask the Navy for help to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, Secretary of State, Ryan Zinke expressed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly suspected that Russian involvement in Syria - especially, where it operates on legitimate government invitations - is a pretence to explore the new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is they want to be energy make-up, just like they did in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reported.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to make sure the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the event participants held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group of non-profits who called himself "the voice of energy customers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to a deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they were the same.
"Economic choices in Iran and Russia are less, exploiting and changing fuels," he said, referring to Russia as one of the "experts in the field" with economies that depend on fossil fuels.
This statement appears when Trump's government representatives are doing a mission in order to increase their liquid gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump's government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to pull itself out of North Stream 2 "unsuitable" oil plant pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a "container" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the two-billion-billion-dollar North Stream oil plant project, which is designed to enhance the capacity of the oil-blowing plant that exists up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a pure economic project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's hard resistance to this project was merely driven by economic reasons and was an example of unfair competition.
"I'm sure we have the same view that energy cannot be made a tool to put pressure on it and that customers should be able to choose their own supplier," said Russian Minister for Energy Aleksandr Novak after meeting with US Minister for Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US attitude has attracted the reaction of Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to this project.
The leading German industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to interfere in European Union energy policy and bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I will face big problems if the third country mixes our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the latest meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "respect the situation" when recommending himself as President in 2020, said Senator Massachusetts
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said he'd "look at the situation" when he nominated himself as president after the part-time election.
While campaigning at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirms he will consider himself himself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, including putting women in the top position," he said to The Hill.
"After the 6th of November, I'll look into the situation when I'm running for president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while campaigning at the city hall, saying that he "brought this area in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren's criticism of Trump and the future Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we make a vote."
However, an opinion published on Thursday shows that most of Warren’s own constitutions do not want him to run for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts say it's best that the senator doesn't run, according to the opinion of Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent that supports the claim.
The opinion shows more support for former Governor Deval Patrick for himself, with 38 percent supporting himself and 48 percent against him.
Other important names on the Democratic Party discussed in connection with the possibility of self-scheduling in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd officially decide on it in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quoted PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump's campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What happened to my son, what would happen when he returned, I could connect with another family who also felt the consequences of PTSD and some injuries suffered by our soldiers," he said in front of the audience who were present at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin calls his capture "an elephant in the room" and tells of his son and other war veterans, "they return a bit differently, they come back harder, they come back and wonder if there's respect for what they've given each other, for the other soldiers and for the other fighters and for every other member of the military to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, plus with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in the state of drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, the spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support the legal challenge to new U.S. policies that refuse asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court briefing on Friday in Washington to support the asylum seekers challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of Grace v.'s defendant in a session called the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and his son was a cruel gang member," had insulted him, but the U.S. officials refused his asylum on July 20th.
He's under arrest in Texas.
The state attorney for Grace’s support described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced a large number of lawyers for the U.S.A., as a country facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy goes against the Council's 2014 decision to allow black immigrants to escape violence in their homes to apply for asylum.
Attorney General District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy "has ignored state, federal, and international laws that have existed for decades."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims should be determined on the basis of certain facts and conditions related to that claim, and such prohibition is contrary to the principle," friend-of-the short briefing said.
Further the prosecutor's opinion is that the policy that refuses to enter the U.S. economy lost immigrants says that they're likely to be entrepreneurs and "get the necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June ordered the immigration judge to no longer give asylum to victims who fled from domestic violence and gang violence.
"So it is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear caused by race, religion, nationality, or membership in a social group, or certain political opinion," Sessions said in this policy announcement on June 11.
It's not meant to ease all the problems -- even though all the problems are serious -- that people all over the world face every day.
A very sad rescue effort in the tree because the victim doubles as he competes with time to find a survivor
For those who survived, the situation was getting worse.
"It's very exciting," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calming her baby boy who was on the back of the refugee center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes with a body.
Clean water is very rare."
People look back to their destroyed homes, take the stuff that's soaked up the water, try to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and taken care of in the hospital, the damage caused by a 7,5-strong earthquake, is so fucked up.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffer from a broken back and shoulder, lie outside the Palo Army Hospital, where patients are treated outside the room because of a powerful earthquake.
His tears flow as he recounts his feelings as the earthquake shook the five - floor hotel room where he stayed with his wife and daughter.
"It wasn't able to save itself.
I think I'm stuck in the wall ruins," Haris told the Associated Press, he added his family to the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, then shut up.
I did not know my son and his circumstances.
May they be saved."
U.S. Ambassador accuses Tionkok 'doing intimidation' with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after the official newspaper Tiongkok had a four-page advertisement in an US newspaper that called the U.S. trading backlog, the U.S. ambassador for Tiongk accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
The U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a supplement paid by China Daily in Des Moines Registers - the most public newspapers in the state of Iowa - after accusing Tiongkok of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congress election on November 6, an accusation filed by Tiongkok.
Trump's claim that Beijing was trying to get involved in the U.S. election, which marks what the U.S. officials told Reuters, was a new phase in the expansion of Washington's campaign to press Tiongkok.
Although it's a common thing for foreign governments to put commercials to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington are trapped in an ever-increasing trade war, which makes them raise the rate of import to each other.
Tiongkok's pay rate at the beginning of this trade war was designed to hit exporters in the state like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of the former leadership of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has damaged the workers, farmers, and businessmen in America.
Tyeongkok, Branstad wrote an opinion at Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now duplicate the intimidation by running advertising on our own free media."
"In spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the tradition of free speech and press freedom that was highly valued in the United States with paid commercials in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In fact, at the street newspaper outlets here, in Beijing, you'll find a barrier to different voices and you won't see the actual mirror of the different opinions that people may have about the troubled Tiongkok economy, considering the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent media in Tiongkok denied the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
Analyst Warning, Republic Party Avoids Women's Elections Near the End of Time With the Disaster of Kavanaugh
Because prominent people in the Republican Party who stand up and defend the prospective Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in dealing with a number of allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will see a return attack, especially from women, on the upcoming part-time elections.
Emotions of this problem are very high, and most members of the Republican Party have already shown that they want to move forward in the vote.
It cannot be prevented," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator's (R-Arizona) push in the final minutes to do an FBI investigation would be enough to ease the anger on the voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn said it on Friday, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators shouted "November is near!" when they did a demonstration in the Senate hall when the Republican Party controlled the Justice Committee to continue to advance in Kavanaugh's pleadings escaped the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will come out of the list," political analyst non party Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among women's voice-blowers in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, because they don't like the president, often don't give voice."
Even before Ford’s public testimony explaining in detail the sexual harassment of himself by the prospective Supreme Court leader, analysts advise that there will be a retaliatory attack if the Republican Party continues to push him forward with confirmation.
"It became a mess for GOP," said Michael Steele, former head of the National Committee of the Republic Party, earlier this week, to NBC News.
"It's not just about the election of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the backup bench, it's also about how the Republican Party handles this issue and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities, a group that helps to choose the Democratic Party, points to the news channel.
But the Americans would seem to be divided about who should be trusted after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more choice for the last.
A new poll that YouGov did shows that 41 percent of respondents really believe in or perhaps believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they really believe in or maybe believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or really lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford and one of the other bullies, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Justice Committee that the drunk Cavanaugh had attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court's candidate showed him his candidacy when they attended a party while they were in Yale in the 1980s.
A World Wide Webcomcomer is planning to start a new Internet to address Google and Facebook
The Berners-Lee team, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that tried to match Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the open source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, while joking Berners-Lee says that the meaning behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to start now," he said from the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
This application uses Solid technology that allows people to make "private online data storage" or their own POD.
The storage can include contact lists, task lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about this personal online data storage is that it's really up to the user who can access what kind of information.
At the company known as "personal empowerment through data."
The idea to set up Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce's company, is to provide the company with resources, processes, and skills that are right to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is now composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM-buyed security platform, some staff developers contracted to work on the project, and the volunteer community code maker.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralization applications using the tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not they would introduce a total change where all their business models would actually be reversed last night.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a post on the Medium that was published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built above Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in network-disputed neutrality.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.

Bernard Vann: warn the WW1 Victoria Cross
The only Church scholar in England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior, remembered in his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won an award on September 29, 1918 for the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attacks.
However, four days later he was killed by snipers and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A warning stone mourned by two of his grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a symbol of intelligence that would reveal exactly 100 years of his grandfather's achievement won the award.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across Canal de Saint-Quentin "passes a very thick fog under the firing squad of field weapons and machinery."
Then he rushed forward to the battle line and with the "great courage" leading the front line before rushing using the field weapon alone and slowing down three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, says his grandfather's action is "something I know I won't be able to live but it's a very humble act."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also put up a bouquet of flowers after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says he's "very delighted to play a part in this parade" and adds "the courage of a true hero being shown by the support of many people."
MMA fans stayed all night watching Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you've been spending the night watching Bellator 206 who's full of pain just to avoid watching the main event.
The bills from San Jose contain 13 battles, including six on the main card and are being displayed directly all night in England on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face each other, the audience in England was shocked when the loop turned into Peppa Pig.
Some feel unappreciated after their stay until the early days of the fight.
A fan on Twitter describes the change to cartoon children as "a annoying joke."
"This is a government rule, that at 6:00 a.m. the content is not suitable for viewing, so replaced with the children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, senior marketing vice president and Bellator's communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker's company said that they're going to fix their schedule by counting the audience in England in the future.
"In my opinion, if we think about replaying, I think we might be able to finish it," said Coker.
"But now there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, at the change, there's a lot of back-and-back text and everything's uneducated.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government matter.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
We're going to cut down to five fights from six fights - as we used to do - and we're going to try to avoid excessive staging for fans, and we're doing it.
This is an unprofitable state."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'low' about sexuality
Tom Daley’s Olimpiade diver said he grew up with low self - esteem because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old man said he didn't realize until he entered high school, that "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, he said, he talked about the right of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent doesn't care so much about winning the Olympics.
The host of the usual show with this long-standing show, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off because of the pain.
He acted as a sloppy person on Laverne's first program, and Daley said he felt "less than" everyone else growing up with him because "not what is socially acceptable to like men and women."
He said, "To this day, it is a feeling less than any other, and a different feeling has become a real thing that gives me power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let everyone down when they found out about his sexuality.
The two Olympic bronze medalists have become the lead of the famous LGBT campaign and have used their appearance at Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries not to discriminate against homosexuals.
He said that he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world champion three times said he fell in love with a guy -- the movie maker from the U.S. Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 -- "surprising me."
Daley married Oscar's 20 years older than him last year, and says that age gap is not an issue.
"When you have so many problems at a very young age," he followed his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was very difficult to find someone with the same age who experienced the same tide.
This couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "the whole perspective" has changed.
"If you ask me last year, it's all around 'I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know, there's a bigger thing than winning the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father can't accept that he's going to die, and one of the last things he asks is whether they've got tickets for the London 2012 Olympics - because he wants to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'You won't sit in the front row father'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, I finally admitted that he was invincible," he said.
The next year Daley competes in the 2012 Olympics and wins the bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I dreamt of all my life--to dive in front of the crowd of people in the Olympics, no feeling better than that," he said.
It also inspires his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - that has joined him in his preparations for the Olympics and still makes him a little less.
Desert Island Discs is BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changed his role when being served at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American pelf Phil Mickelson will record the record on Sunday as he plays the 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to change his role to avoid an unpleasant achievement.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year-old event to record the 12th time, was suggested by Captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball game and the four-group game on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of action, as he used to do for the United States, the main winner five times this divides the time between being a cheerleader and doing his game on that scale, hoping to fix what has troubled him.
Never become the straightest golfer even when he is at the top of his career, this 48 - year - old man does not fit to take a very strict course in Le Golf National, which routinely gives long and harsh punishment for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it's not scary enough for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, to face the very accurate English champion Francesco Molinari, who has worked with the new arrival Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four matches this week.
If this American golfer, starting 12 single games with four points below, starting with a hot start, then the Mickelson game proved to be very important.
Furyk declared his confidence in this man, not because he could say a lot more.
"He really understands his role today, slaps my back and embraces me, and says he'll be ready for the game tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's so confident.
He was the Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine he played two games.
I imagined something else, but that's the way it is and that's the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most popular Ryder Cup game, on Sunday.
It can mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup that will never match the height of his individual record.
Mickelson's 18th victory, 20 defeats, and seven times the series, although Furyk said his presence brought some things that couldn't be said to the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's sly, he's funny, he's funny, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he said.
"I think a younger player has fun with him, this week too, which is pretty fun to see.
He's given a lot of things, more than just playing."
Captain European Thomas Bjorn knew the great superiority could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, learned from experience that someone who leads quite big into his last single game at Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant journey.
Dane made his first debut at the 1997 Valderrama match, with the captain of the Seven Ballesteros team holding five points above America, but just touched the finish line with their nose with the thinest margin, won 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we've got great superiority in Valderrama; we've got great superiority in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just now," said Bjorn, taking pictures, after watching the Class of 2018, won 5-3 well on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you will enter a really boring game.
Get out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you get the points on the writing board.
We have a target, and the goal is to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've been saying a long time ago, I've focused on 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side - the world's greatest players."
It's nice to see the players playing in the tough golf field, Bjorn adds: "In this case I'll never go ahead on my own.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players will move forward, and this is a different thing to do.
It's really nice to be out there with a partner if everything goes well, but if you're out there playing individually, then your full ability as a golfer will be tested.
That's the message you have to tell all players, get the best out of yourself for the game tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk's opponent will ask the players to play better individually than they do as a pair, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself had been on both ends of the last day of the great game, had become part of the team that won in Brookline before ending with defeat when Europe did "The Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every word," he said, answering the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought the players together toward the last day.
"We've got 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start it quickly as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When the moment goes one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in different ways we think, you know, we're trying to do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been commissioned to try to lead the fight against Rory McIllroy at the top, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players in the top order.
"I went with a group of these guys in a sequence like this because I think I could close all the way," said Bjorn about his single choice.
The new German warship was rescheduled
The new German Navy warship was supposed to have been on duty in 2014 to replace the old Cold War era warship, but it won't be there until next year at least because of the wrong system and the rising cost, the local media report.
The assignment of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg guard ship, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, who quotes military speakers.
This ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the post-shipment issue has disturbed the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships that had been ordered by the Navy in 2007 will come to replace the old Bremen class ship.
This ship will be equipped with strong cannons, a series of anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-capal missiles, as well as some demon technology, such as radar eraser, infrared, and acoustic keys.
Other important features include longer periods of treatment — it should be possible to use the latest watchman ship for two years away from its original port.
However, the postponement always means that this advanced warship -- which is said to enable Germany to highlight its strength abroad -- will be obsolete when it begins to enter the time of its assignment, Die Zeit notes.
The f125 ship of bad luck had become a preaching last year, when the German Navy officially refused to appoint the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship building in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy returned the ship to the ship builder after shipping.
Only a few reasons are known behind the return of the ship, but the German media cites a number of important "software and hardware defects" that make the warship useless if used for a battle mission.
The software defect is very important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will be operated by the crew of 120 sailors - only half of the workforce on the older Bremen class warship.
It was also discovered that the ship's bobot would be too much to reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add updates in the future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with this 7,000-ton bomber is believed to be twice as heavy as a ship with a similar class used by Germany in the Second World War.
In addition to the damaged hardware, the cost of producing the entire project - including crew training - is also a problem.
It is said to rise surprisingly to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - rising from the beginning of €2.2 billion.
The problem that has gripped the ship of the new watchman has become vital in view of the latest warning that the German naval forces have been forced to fend off.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliamentary Defense Committee acknowledges that the Navy is actually "out of ships with the ability to spread."
The officer says that as this problem gets bigger, because old ships are no longer used, but there is no replacement ship available.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg's ship guards could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to bat secret life secretly
New research is being done at a farm in Scotland’s Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use natural dams in their food hunt.
Expected this discovery will provide a new light on this unique flying mammal behavior and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The studies carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common bats and sopranos and long-sleeved chocolate bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special footage will be placed at the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform a cellular survey using a magnetic detector.
Sounders who analyze all recordings will ensure the frequency of bat calls and which species do what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be created to create images with a detailed nature scale of behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes this result will reveal which habitat area is most important to bats and how each species uses it.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the work of habitat management such as grass - building and the best way to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
Battalion populations in Scotland and throughout England have fallen sharply in the last few centuries.
These bats are threatened with the construction and development work that affects the nest and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as glued paper to trap bats and chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks from pets.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because of his habit of hunting at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes in catching prey.
They're using advanced echo tracking techniques to find insects properly and obstacles in their flight lanes.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, is very concerned about bats.
It has ten trained personnel, who routinely do survey, survey the nests, and sometimes rescue efforts.
This organization has also set up the first and only natural berries in Scotland at the Threave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of ten bat species in Scotland.
Farm manager David Thompson said that farming is a suitable area for bats.
"Here in Threave, we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many old trees, and all good habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to grow."
He stressed the importance of bat checks before carrying out maintenance on the property, because unaware of the possibility of the destruction of a copycat nest could kill up to 400 female bats and a small one, which would probably destroy the entire local population.
Bats protected, killed, harassed, or destroyed by our enemies are just illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland’s official for Trust Kelelawar Conservation, has encouraged the public to help.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot about our bats and for many of our species that we don't know how their fate is."
Ronaldo who refuses rape claims is preparing lawyers to sue for German magazines
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape claim on him "false news," and said that people "wanted to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer demanded German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusation.
This attacker Portugal and Juventus were accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was then expected to have paid him $375.000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in the Instagram live video to 142 million followers a few hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is false news," the winner of Ballon d'Or five times said to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's the usual thing.
They want to be famous for calling my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is getting ready to sue Der Spiegel for the charge, which they call "a report of unacceptable privacy suspicion," says Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said he would claim compensation as "for moral damages in a number consistent with the weight of the infringement, which may be one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in the past few years."
The incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga were reported back to the player's room, where he was suspected of having raped him, according to a report presented at Clark's District Court in Nevada.
Majorga says Ronaldo kneels after the incident is charged and tells him that "99 percent" he's a "good guy" who disappoints only "one percent."
The document said that Ronaldo confirmed that they were both having sex, but it was based on desire together.
Majorga also said he went to the police station and had a vision of his injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to solve the problem outside the court because he felt "fears of getting revenge" and worried "to be humiliated in public."
This 34-year-old woman says now she's trying to cancel the peace settlement because she's constantly traumatized on the alleged incident.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the giant Italian Juve club with a €100 million deal.
Brexit: England 'will regret forever' for the loss of the carmakers
English "will be forever sorry" for losing its status as world leader after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added to Toyota, England had told the BBC that if the British came out of the European Union without a deal, for a while it would stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car builder said the impact of the border suspension if there were no deal, would have cost Brexit a job.
A factory in Burnaston - which made the production of Auris and Avensis Toyota - produce nearly 150,000 cars last year, with 90% exported to the whole European Union.
"I think it's British coming out of the European Union at the end of March, we're going to see the production halt in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of the Toyota executioner in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concern about their exit from the European Union without a deal about how cross-border trade will run, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem with what the carmakers said was the risk of the supply chain if there's no deal with Brexit.
Toyota production lines are run on the basis of the "right time" production principle, with spare tribes entering every 37 minutes of English and European Union entry for cars made as ordered.
If the British were to leave the European Union without a deal on March 29, there might be a disturbance at the border, which the industry thought could cause the slowdown and the lack of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at her factory in Derbyshire, the company's representative said, and thus production will be stopped.
Clark said the plan of Chequers Theresa May to connect with the European Union in the future is "calibrated properly to avoid border checks."
"We need to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that will also allow what I'm saying not only to enjoy success at the moment, but for us to get this chance," he told BBC Radio 4.
"It's not just Toyota but other producers too, that we really have to be able to continue what's been a very well-walking supply chain."
Toyota can't say how long the production will be stopped, but clearly in the long run, warns that increased costs will reduce the power of the steel factory and will eventually be costing the job.
Peter Tsovallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and has been the manager of the United Workers' Association at the factory, says his members are already worried: "According to my experience, once this job is released, it will never come back.
The government spokesperson said, "We've put forward a proper and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed, White House said
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with attorney's deputy attorney Rod Rosenstein can be "scheduled back a week more" because of the ongoing fight of the future High Court Chief Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the public elections, the relationship between Trump and Russia's servants, and the potential that hinders the president's justice.
Whether Trump would fire the deputy attorney grandiose or not, who would endanger Mueller's freedom, has been triggering gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using telegrams to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of merging the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein disputed the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, in the middle of a report that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations Office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he'd "choose to not" fired Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate court committee where Cavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week over Kavanaugh's claim, which then postponed the full vote of the Senate.
Press secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, shows on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "For that meeting hasn't been set up, so this week, I can see that putting it down to another good week also recalling the other things that happened in the high court.
But we just see and I've always wanted to deliver the latest news to the press."
Some journalists will object to the statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since September 10.
The host of Chris Wallace's show asked why.
Sanders says the meeting is rare not because of the dislike of TV journalists "who are trying to attract attention," though, he says, "I disagree with the fact that they're trying to attract attention."
Then he proposed that direct contact between Trump and press be improved.
"The president did more direct questions than the previous president," he said, adding without mentioning the evidence, "We've seen the numbers."
The meeting is still going to happen, says Sanders, but "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried more often and you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it'll replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump routinely asked questions when leaving the White House or participating in open session or press conference with visiting high officials.
The solo press conference rarely happens.
This week in New York, the president might point out why, doing free looks and sometimes weird before the journalists gather.
The health secretary wrote to the European Union workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit's concerns
The Health Secretary has written a letter to the European Union staff working in NHS Scotland to express their gratitude and hope that they will still be working here after Brexit's problem.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until England pulled itself out of the European Union.
The government of Scotland has committed to meet the fixed-term payment costs for European Union citizens who work in the transferred public service.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between England and the European Union on this withdrawal continue, approaching the decision expected this fall.
But the British government has also been prepared for the possibility of no deal.
I know this must be very disturbing to you all.
That's why I want to reiterate now how much I appreciate the contributions of every member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union, and others, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and enhance health services, and benefit our patients and society.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Performs Emergency Surgery After Experiencing Head Injury
The back end of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency after having suffered a head injury on the 31-27 defeat of Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Chief of State Coach Tennessee, Rod Reed told the injured reporter that it happened shortly before the rounds ended.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell unconscious there," said Reed.
Coach and medical power gave oxygen to Abercrombie on the edge of the field before putting it in the bay and brought it to further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details of the kind of injury suffered" and the State of Tennessee were trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, this second-degree student of red socks, was in his first season with the State of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
He got five totals on Saturday before leaving the game, which turned his totals into 18 shots during this season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher price if they buy property in England
Foreign buyers will charge higher materiel costs when they buy property in England, with additional money that will be used to help homeless people according to Tory's new plan
This step will hold Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
This material charge will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in England.
The Finance Department estimates to collect up to £120 million a year- to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will wear higher mattresses when they buy property in England - and additional money that will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce it today.
This step will be seen as an effort to halt the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters by promising to provide more affordable housing and target high income.
Material charges will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in England, along with additional money that motivates government efforts to fight bums.
Additional costs are an additional cost on today’s materiel costs, including a higher level that was introduced two years ago at the purchase of the second home and the purchase of the house for rent - up to three percent.
The Finance Department expects this move to rise to £120 million a year.
It's estimated that 13 percent of the newly built property in London was purchased by non-English people, which led to higher prices and made it harder for the first buyer to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many rich areas in this country - usually in the capital - have become "the ghost city" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called for a cutting-off of mattress costs to help more young people have their first home.
He accused a large construction company of maintaining the price of property remained high by buying the land but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to ignore the quota for the homes it reached in order to repair the "aib housing" in England.
Corbyn has announced a series of reform proposals in the interesting housing sector, including renting supervision and terminating a "no guilt".
He also wants to give the council greater power to build new houses.
Mrs. May said, "Then I promise I'll dedicate the prime minister's office to restoring the English dream--that life must be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our bankrupt housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to stay, work, and build lives here.
However, it is not the right thing for individuals who do not live in England, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy homes as simple as those who are already working hard.
For many people the dream of having a house is a very distant thing, and an indecency towards the homeless.
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the Scottish team'
Boss Sunderland, Jack Ross says "his main ambition" is to be a Scottish manager at some stage.
The Scottish player is 42 years old, enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which is currently ranked third in League One, approximately three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last summer.
"I want to establish my country as a player.
I got B's hat and it's him," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up and watched the Scottish team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always became something that would attract me to return.
But the opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management."
Manager Sunderland before Ross among others Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
This former Alloa Athletic boss says he doesn't feel afraid to follow the traces of such big names in the club, after he's previously declined the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the current success will be measured by 'Can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities in this club, there is no doubt to be in the Premier League," he said.
"Don't be easy to be there, but I'll probably just see myself as a successful person here, if I can bring this club back there."
Ross career in team management for just three years, after some time as a boss's assistant in Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coach's staff in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to third position, and turned St Mirren from the degradation abyss into the winner of the championship in the following season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It's probably the intersection of the road that I have to cross," he remembers taking over Alloa.
"I really believe management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I'm fine, looking for a decent living, and enjoying some natural things.
But playing can be hard.
A lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still experience it in terms of work pressure, but in management it feels fine.
I've always wanted to lead something and now I'm doing it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt in my adult life."

Summer summer waves have increased pub-pub income in England struggling to survive, but more put pressure on the restaurant network.
Figures show, pubs and bars see sales rise 2.7 percent in July - but income in restaurants is down 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant, who compiled the numbers, said: "The sun that shines hot and British participation in the World Cup is longer than expected means that July will follow the same pattern as the month of June before, where pub income increases by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that get a hard hold.
The drop in restaurant trade of 1.8 percent in June is going to get worse in July.
The pub and bar sales that sell drinks so far are more powerful than what happens at the restaurant that goes down.
The pub that sells food also suffers from the heat of the sun, even though it is not separate from the restaurant operator.
Looks like people just came out for a drink.
Sales throughout the pubs and the coolest bar selling drinks up to 6.6 percent for this month, with those selling food down three percent."
Paul Newman, a recreational analyst and RSM hotel says: "This has continued the train we've seen since April.
Weather and impacts of social events or major sports remain the greatest factor involved in market sales outside the home.
It is no surprise that the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, although sales decreases of 4.8 percent from year to year will be very painful over the current cost pressure.
The long summer should not come when the operator who sells food has a bad time, and the time will tell if the temperature is good enough that we have enjoyed in August will give you some needed rest."
Total sales growth throughout the pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, were 2.7 percent in July, showing delays in branding.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales survey for pubs, bars, and restaurants in England gathers and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with osset combined more than £9 billion, and is a total industrial size that can't be traced again.
One of five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
Survey reveals, one of five children - some of whom are still 11 years old - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
Survey of 20,000 middle school students reveal the page "False Institute"
This news has increased the concern of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have "main" accounts to show parents
One of five children - some of whom are still 11 years old - make social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed the development of a "false institute" account -- a reference to the photo-sharing site in Instagram.
The news has increased the concern of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they operate the "main" account that has been cleared to show their parents, while they also have a personal account.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found a teenager who asked someone else to " Rape me."
The research conducted by the British Digital Consciousness and the Head of Women's School Conference (HMC) from independent schools found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them claiming to hold a personal account.
HMC chief, Mike Buchanan said: "This is disturbing so many teenagers who try to create online space that their parents and teachers cannot find."
Eilidh Doyle will be "sounding for athletes" at the Scottish Athletic Council.
Eilidh Doyle has been selected to enter the Scottish Athletic Board as a non-executive director at the annual public meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle was the most honored athlete and Scottish field, and the head of Ian Beattie described this movement as a great opportunity for those who led the sports field to benefit from his various international experiences over the last few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we believe that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him into the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I acted as a voice for athletes and I wish I could really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
The American athletic athlete, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre run at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the four gold medals of his Olympics and now becomes the BBC expert, is now unable to walk after a moment of ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "It was a month ago that I suffered from stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said that only time can determine whether I can recover and to what level the recovery is possible.
It's like a very tiring job to get back to full recovery, learn how to walk again, and today do a capable exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump commercials comparing mother to cow have split opinions in the online world
The breast - pump company has split opinions in the online world with an advertisement that compares the mother who nursed with the cow that is dying.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be a "pump of breasts that can be used with the first silence in the world," Elvie's consumer technology company released an advertising inspired by the video of gypsy music to show the freedom of this new pump to express a mother.
Four moms danced in the barn containing herrings following a song that included lyrics like this: "Yes, I blush myself, but you don't see tails" and "If you don't notice this isn't ambling, it's my tits."
It goes on with the refrain: "Out pump, out pump, out pump, I feed them baby, out pump, out pump, I milk my lady."
However, the ads that have been posted on this company's Facebook page have caused online controversy.
With 77,000 times seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received a variety of reactions from viewers, with many saying it causes "worry" in the milk industry.
"A very bad decision using cows to advertise this product.
Like us, cows should also be pregnant and give birth to milk, except the baby was stolen from them in a few days after giving birth," someone wrote.
Elvie breast pump is very fit in BH nourishing (Elvie/Ibu)
Another comment: "A trauma that can be understood well for mothers and babies.
But why not use it to advertise the breast pump for the mother who has to look after the baby?"
Another adds: "An ad is meaningless."
Someone else defended the ad, with a woman admitting that she found the song "lucue."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still feeding.
Squeezing makes me feel exactly like a cow.
That ad was kind of crazy, but I accepted it.
It's a genius product," wrote someone.
Another commented: "This is a pleasant advertisement for mothers who blackmail (often at their workplace or toilet) and who feel like "cheese."
This is not an advertisement to praise or judge the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with hidden pumps that were tucked in their bras.
The basic concept of this campaign comes from the perception of many women who blackmail the ASI who say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is really quiet, without wire or tube and fit in bra nourishing, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby, and even go out squeezing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother comments: "Elvie Pumps are worthy of launch with convincing and provocative.
By comparing the expression of the woman with the cow we want to pump the ASI and all its challenges, and showing it in a way that pleases and delights with the full freedom offered by the new pump.
It's not the first time that Elvie's pump has been the headline.

Hundreds of Migraine Children Move Silently to Tent Place on Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children is increasing even though the monthly border crossing is still unchanged, partly as a result of the harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump government that make it difficult for children to take care of sponsors.
Basically, most of the sponsors themselves are immigrants without documents, and fear to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by moving forward to save children.
Risk is increasing in June, when the federal government announces that potential sponsors and other senior members of the household should hand over fingerprints, and their data will be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and Bea Cukai official, testified in front of Congress that the institution has captured dozens of people who have applied to sponsor children under the most advanced age.
The agency then made sure that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80 percent of people who become sponsors or sponsors are illegally in this country, and most of them are bad foreigners.
That is why we keep hunting these men," said Mr. Albence.
Aimed to process children faster, officials have introduced new regulations requiring some of them to attend court within a month of arrest, not after 60 days, which has become the standard before, to cover the workers of shelter.
Most of them perform through video conference calls, not direct, to plead their legal status case to the immigration judge.
Those who are considered unworthy of help will be deported directly.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, leading to increased violence or attempts to escape, the workers of shelter and system reports that have been accepted in the last few months.
The lawyers say that the concerns are increasing in larger facilities like Tornillo, whose signs are on a child struggling tend to be ignored because of its size.
They say that moving children to camp without giving them enough emotional preparation or saying good-bye to their friends can make a lot of trauma worse.
Syria asked the US, France and Turkey to retreat immediately.
Speaking in the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return, although the country's war has now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as the prime minister's representative, said foreign troops occupying the land of Syria illegally, for reasons of combating terrorism, and "will be handled accordingly."
"They must retreat as soon as possible and without any conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem asserts that "war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with over millions fleeing their homes.
He affirms that Damascus will continue to "war against this holy battle until we cleanse all of Syria's territories of terror and "the presence of illegal foreign soldiers."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, especially training and influencing the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in war - torn territories.
With regard to the problem of refugees, Moualem confirmed that they should return immediately, and he blames "a few western countries" for "placing extraordinary fears" that motivate refugees to move further away.
"We have asked international society and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They're politicizing what's supposed to be the problem of humanity."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats said the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the large fortress of the last Idlib rebels has provided an opportunity to continue the political discussion.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented the massive attacks of the Syrian army supported in that province, where there are three million people who live.
But Moualem asserts that the agreement has "clear timing" and gives rise to the hope that military action will target the Mujahids including the fighters of the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be swept away."
U.N. Staffan de Mistura was hoping that the first meeting of the new government and opposition committees would quickly be convened to create the post-war elections for Syria and pave the way for the public elections.
Moualem published the requirements of the Syrian government on the committee, asserting that panel work should be restricted "to review the latest draft chapters," and warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Period
According to those logic, Trump will win the public election again in 2020 except because many liberal spectators hope that the prosecution and scandal will end his presidency early.
No one doubts, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
Until now, there are no signs of fatigue for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's top-level watch has increased more than twice to 1.05 million and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average 2.4 million viewers, rising from 1.7 million to four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped cable TV ranks with 3.5 million viewers on the night of the headline news.
"It's a spirit that makes people interested in something that's not understood," said Neal Baer, the host of the ABC drama "Designed Survival," about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedian author and author "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truth In sneaking into Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He remembered taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he'd give Trump his voice right.
Why? He asked.
"He said, "Because he made me laugh," Miss Scovell told me.
There's a value of entertainment in a mess.
Surely, unlike any other event on TV, the story line that emerged from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the immigrant family can unite again and restore the global economy.
Unlike that, the most outstanding audience in the world has luxury.
In spite of this, not just being a citizen of the country who knows when you're six hours old, you've found yourself watching panel experts discuss the use of "back" Bob Woodward's source for the book called "Fear," Paul Manafort's camelskin bomber jacket worth $15,000, and the implications of the terrible Stormy Daniels description of Trump anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario again.
"The subject of the policy he's doing makes it the same as a reality event that comforts you every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive head Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator "Pawn Stars," about the performer and storybook Trump (choose hostile to NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

A lot of money from outside flooded the tightest part-time selection in the White House
It is only natural that Pennsylvania 17 was flooded with money, thanks to the re-arrangement of the congress district that surrounded two peasants in the same chair.
Pittsburg District recently re-established, filed Conor Lamb from Rep. Demokrat - who won the other district seats through the special election last spring.
Lamb advances against other peasants, Keith Rothfus Republic, who now represents the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which is inundated with the new Pennsylvania 17 district.
These maps were re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally on the part of the Republic.
The competition in the new Pennsylvania 17 district has resulted in a great campaign between the financial side of the big party, the Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lambs became increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in the March special election, which was under public scrutiny for the 18th Pennsylvania Congress District.
The seat has been held by the Republican Party officials for over a decade, and President Donald Trump wins the district with 20 points.
Political experts are sending the Democratic party a little superior.
The U.S. Balanced Sentenced El Salvador for Supporting Tiongkok, Then Back
Diplomats ensure that the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing, by giving a little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and ordered hotels in Panama until the partner expelled the Trump Organization management team.
The Department of Foreign Affairs decided to withdraw the head of the American diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest decision no longer to acknowledge Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokesperson, appeared in a statement earlier this month.
However, the punishment is considered only to El Salvador, who has received some $140 million from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed punishment, which includes financial relief and visa restrictions, would harm the Central American country and increase unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings continue, North and Central American officials postpone high-level conferences that focus on security and economic prosperity to follow up the same meeting last year that was considered a step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior government officials confirmed that they wanted the conference to be continued, so that it would effectively end the judgement of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as an important signal from the government at the meeting, to the diplomats.
And three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing new counsel or severe punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate outlined by the three United States officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations of this unclear situation.
Their statements were reinforced by outside analysts close to the government and also spoke about this inconclusive situation.
Studies
Another shocking story is a special report by Robert Mueller on the possibility of Mr. Trump's court hearing, which is now very important evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's report also discusses his investigation of Trump's campaign as a coalition with Russia in attacking our general election.
When Congress moves in hand, Mr. Trump will be asked for responsibility from him, just as he prepares to go again in front of the voters, and perhaps eventually become a jury of his partners.
That is why there is still much to be done, and I do not intend to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump’s government cannot be avoided — or his equality in Europe.
There's a choice we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West were to fight him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We've failed, and missed out on the opportunity to avoid the next years of slaughter.
History begins at the heart of such a dormant point, and the accelerated or delayed democratic processions cannot be avoided.
Now the Americans are facing a few points of this change.
What should we do if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who was monitoring the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since this paper reported that, last year, she suggested secretly filming the president and arguing that he didn't deserve to be the president.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times account wasn't right.
"How do we respond if the F.B.I. investigation that Brett Kavanaugh has just been asked is incomplete or fair--or if he is brought to the Supreme Court despite a strong charge of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we going to give Congress a voice in part-time that will call for Trump's responsibility?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will get worse in the long run.
But I believe we'll succeed, because the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my great embassy.
He survived, then migrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light the Sabbath candles on the table that wrote the sorcery.
By leaving that legacy to me, how did I lose hope for our future?"

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans feels optimistic about the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers met Rapid Vienna on Thursday, winning over Austria, following the good results of Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will strengthen their position to escape the G Group of the European League.
The knee injury made the middle corner of Graham Dorrans can't be seen in the first season until the results of 2-2 against Villarreal, but he was convinced that Rangers could take advantage of the result as a stepping stone to greater despair.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal is a great team," said the 31-year-old player.
"In this game we're sure to get something and go by one point.
In the end, we may be able to do it, but, in our view, the results may be fair.
In the first round, they might be better off, but in the second round, we woke up and became a better team.
On Thursday night, it's another great day of Europe.
We hope to be able to meet three points even though it's going to be a tough match because they have good results in their last game, but, with support behind us, I'm sure we can keep moving forward and achieve positive results.
Last year, we had a hard time, because of my injury and the change in the club itself, but now there's a very good hope in this club.
This squad is good and the kids really enjoy it. It's good practice.
Now we can thrive, put the past behind us and achieve success."

Although it turns out that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, only a few people were able to discuss it with their family members.
About half of the people in the nationwide study discuss the long-term care costs with their couples.
Only 10 percent of them say discuss this with their children.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's no way to start the discussion," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Here's the time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your own family for treatment if you do not inform your wishes first.
Be content with your family counselors, where and how you get treatment, because your choice will mean that it is important to determine the cost.
Include your financial advisors: Your advisors can certainly help you in showing you how to pay those fees.
Your choice of long-term care includes the traditional long-term care policy, the hybrid cash insurance policy that guarantees these costs or ensures yourself with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Show your legal documents: Face the lingering legal debate.
Show immediately the power to your health care, someone you believe in to ensure your health care and ensure that your wishes are carried out by professional people when you are unable to communicate.
Moreover, letters of authority in your financial matters should also be considered.
Someone who trusts you to take care of any financial decisions you have to choose, other than to make sure your bills are paid if you can't afford them.
Always remember every detail: Try to imagine when your aged parents are in a state of emergency and on their way to the hospital.
Are you ready to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Write down such details so you're ready to answer.

A man shot a windgun at Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a wind rifle on his way home from a party night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area, Ilfracombe, Devon, when several times shots were fired on the chest, the stomach, and the hand.
The shooting event was described by the officer at about 2:30 a.m. BST, and it's called "a random event."
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The injuries suffered by the victim did not threaten his soul and a number of witnesses have been submitted by the police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
The earthquake and tsunami struck the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, had destroyed at least 384 souls, captured the officers, and the estimated casualties would increase.
The breakdown of communication led officials to difficulties getting information from the Donggala County, a region north of the Palu that is closer to the earthquake center that hits 7.5 Richter scale.
In the Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are some of the main facts about the city of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
The tree is the capital of the Middle Sulawesi province, located on the narrow tip of the bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population estimate of 379,800 in 2017.
When earthquakes and tsunamis hit, this city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
In the meantime, Donggala was an extensive reserve of over 300 miles (180 miles) of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
This county, which is an administrative district under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 souls in 2017.
The economic eye of South Sulawesi Province is looking for fish and crop matching, especially on the coast of Donggala.
However, the existence of important nickel mining also plays a role in this province, although most of it centers in Morrowali, across the coast of Sulawesi.
Recorded over the last 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, over 200 people died in a tsunami disaster and hundreds of homes in Donggala fell to the ground.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami disaster in western Donggala.
In a seismic way, Indonesia is located on the Pacific Firecin and as a result, earthquakes will occur in an orderly manner.
A number of large earthquakes and tsunamis that have plagued the past few years have been as follows:
Year 2004: December 26, Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake, right on the west coast of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered tsunamis in 14 countries, until 226,000 lives were lost along the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half of them died in Aceh.
Year 2005: At the end of March and early April, a series of equally strong earthquakes have struck the west coast of Sumatra.
On Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
The year 2006: The 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, the densest island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami on the south coast, resulting in nearly 700 deaths worldwide.
2009: An earthquake struck 7.6 in the vicinity of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died in the victim's death.
2010: One of the islands of the islands of Sumatra, also struck a 7.5 - strong earthquake, triggering a tsunami that was ten feet [10 m] high and then struck dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya, Aceh, also experienced a shallow earthquake and caused destruction, as well as the panic of those who were reminded of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
Although this time there is no tsunami, more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Lombok, which is called the island of tourism, also experienced a major earthquake that killed more than 500 people, most of whom were on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake caused thousands of buildings and while scattering thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, Sarah Palin's eldest son, former governor Alaska and vice president's candidate, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on domestic violence charges, obstructed domestic violence reports and against arrest efforts, as released by the Alaskan State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, she took the phone call from the woman.
Palin was handed over to the Mat-Su Prep Prison, with a $500 fine without bail, as reported by the KTU.
As reported in the news media, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, declared himself "innocent, surely" when asked about his defense.
Palin faced three minor violations of Class A, which could lead him to one year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
Also, he was also charged with Class B charges, with a day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
For Palin, criminal charges are not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
Her own mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to make a report on the allegations of the attack.
The case is now being filed to the Alaskan Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing reports of domestic violence crimes, and possession of firearms in the state of drunkenness, which are also related to the incident.
Her boyfriend accused her of staring at her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was vexed by a group of veterans associated violence against her son with PTSD as a result of her duties in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of victims died
On Friday, the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia was struck by a massive earthquake until at least 384 victims died.
The 7.5 - scale earthquake that might trigger the tsunami caused thousands of homes to fall into effect.
Power grids and communication connections are broken, and death rates are projected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake struck the central Sulawesis, which was located in the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Video clips showing how terrible the moments of catastrophe spread across social media.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, when the tsunami broke the beach.
The federal prosecutor pays the death penalty that rarely occurs to the suspect of a terror attack in NYC
The federal prosecutor in New York paid the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terror attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- including few and never in the federal crime-related state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is expected to make an attack by hitting the truck he hired from Home Depot to pedestrians and bicycle riders on the bike lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify this death penalty, the prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "in will" killed the eight victims and "in will" also caused serious bodily injury, based on a declaration of willingness to punish the death penalty, which was submitted to the South District of New York.
According to the court documents, the two charges allow the death penalty to be imposed.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury's board set Saipov on 22 charges, including eight charges of murder in the conduct of extortion, which is usually used by the federal prosecutor in the case of organized crime, as well as the charge of violence and the attempt to destroy motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutor, the attack requires "substantial planning and early release," as a description of Saipov's crime that is done with "criminal, cruel, and barbaric."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, danger, and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five victims on the incident were tourists from Argentina.
Counted a decade since the New York South District dropped the death penalty last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of killing two drug dealers, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last execution of the death penalty in the federal court of New York in 1953, was dropped in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were found guilty in a spy conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg was executed with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, from Uzbekistan, does not show the sense of regret as the day and month after the attack.
When asked by the investigator, he said that he was happy with what he had done, sent the police.
Saipov also reveals to the authorities that his attack was inspired by the ISIS video that was watched from his phone, as the charges were.
He also asked the ISIS flag to bet in his hospital room, the police.
He ruled that he was innocent of the 22 charges he had been charged with.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, declared "clearly disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"In our opinion, the decision to execute the death sentence rather than accept a conviction for life imprisonment without bail will only prolong the trauma of the people involved in the incident," Patton said.
Previously, Saipov's defense team had called on the prosecutor not to order a death sentence.
NIGEL FARAGE is the one in charge of Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage's calling for today's citizens' warden in protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the Uchip said that politicians should 'feel the heat' Eurosceptics - because one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, suggested to join in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporters, Peter Bone, told street action in Birmingham that England should come out right now if Farage were to serve as Secretary Brexit.
However, the challenge facing May in its shared position reconciliation has been driven by the supporters of the Remain Tories who joined the separate protest protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister fought to defend his Chequers' compromise plan to stay on his track even in the middle of Brexiteers, Remainers and the European Union.
Allied countries stress that they will be driven forward to reach a deal with Brussels, even if they get a bad reaction -- and force Eurosceptics and Labour to determine the choice between the proposed package and the 'failure'.
Bone told the mass Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to 'get rid of Chequers.
The suggestion is that Farage should point out a partner to be given responsibility in negotiating with Brussels.
"If the responsibility remains with him, we'll be out now," he said.
Members of the Wellingborough Parliament added: "I'm ready to stand up for Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
He said, "We are not fighting in the war of the world to be submissive."
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.'
Bone suppressed the suggestion that potential public opinion has led to changes since the 2016 vote vote: "An idea that the British people's thinking has changed and wanted a steady state, that's absolutely not right."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, also involved in the mass action, appeared to the reporter: 'Simple, I want to say, "Oh, Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Checkers aren't popular in the public, but the opposition won't pick them, because they're not popular with our parties and our activists who really went down the road and made us elected in first place.
Our pleas, get rid of Chequers and start listening to us.'
Through a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Minister maintains their work when they promise."
Farage says that the political demonstration must be constructed in order to 'feel the heat' if they want to disobey the 2016 referendum decision.
'This most valuable time is trust between us - and our political groups,' he said.
'They tried to deny Brexit and here we are today, confirming to them that 'we won't get you to do that'.
He added in a message to an enthusiastic crowd: 'I want you to make our political groups, who are preparing to deny Brexit, also feel the heat.
'We're moving this country's coven that will win us in Brexit and will never give up until Britain's self-reliance, self-reliance, and pride.'
Meanwhile, Remainers’ mass moved through Birmingham before acting in the center of the city for two hours.
The line of activity appears to spread the banner of Tories Against Brexit after setting up its line at the end of this week.
Fellows in the Labour line, Lord Adonis, joked the conservative group on their party security issue when the conference was opened.
‘These people are the ones who tell us that they can master the IT system and all the technology for Canada, whatever, for the anti-rust border, in the boundless free trade chain in Ireland,’ his mother.
‘ It was a real show.
There's no good Brexit at all,' his mother.
Warren plans to do a serious strike in the president's chair.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that he was going to "break the president's candidacy" after the election moment in November.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic Party declared its future at the city hall in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who repeatedly denounced President Donald Trump, nominated himself for a re-election in November against the state GOP representative Geoff Diehl, the president of Trump's campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was marked against Trump by 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th with the voters, which was called in the city hall format since Trump's office.
A contestant asked him a question, if there was any plan to run for president.
Warren also said, "This is the right time for women to enter the Washington circle to restore our broken government, and it's the time for women to sit at the top."
Arrested the shooter Sims, the LSU player
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced the arrest of the suspect of the shooting to cause the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m. in the ET press conference.
They released the video of the shooting on Friday, where a identified man asked for help as seen in the footage.
Friday morning, Sims, 20 years old, was shot and found dead near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury and eventually died," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, to the media on Saturday, through 247sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend and Simpson took a shot at him.
When interrogated, Simpson claims to be at the scene of the incident, holding a firearm, and shooting him towards Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a fight and imprisoned in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-inch-high junior player, growing up in Baton Rouge, that's the Sims figure, has played in 32 games with 10 in the past season and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls in each game.
Original Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world after the team admitted his victory over Sebastian Vettel
It's all clear when Valtteri Bottas is in front of Lewis Hamilton on a qualifying date on Saturday that will bring the Mercedes team's orders have a great role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton because he held his position at the first two and pulled Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel was the first to move into the pit and let Hamilton move in the thicker at the end of the crowd, something that should be very determined.
Mercedes entered pit one lap after and left after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to move after some chase action that showed Ferrari's driver's reluctance to leave the inside empty with the risk of surviving after a double movement to survive at the third angle.
Max Verstappen started at the back grid and was in seventh position at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead in most races because he held the tire replacement to target the quick completion and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for the fourth position.
He finally went into the pit on the 44th lap but couldn't step up on the eight remaining laps because Raikkonen finally took the fourth position.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man who let me.
Tim has done an amazing job of having a two," says Hamilton.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein in a relic on Saturday through his village, he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about a sexual violence against future Supreme Justice Brett Kavanaugh
Speaking in a religion in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver the statement that Ford had given before the Senate Justice Committee, instead of commenting on what was happening in the Senate that showed people who were "wicked and dishonest and dishonest."
"Something that can happen and something beautiful that's been happening for the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see the angry and evil people and the perverts and the dishonest," he said.
"When you saw the crossing and the leak then they said "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Okay, wait a minute.
If we leaked... No, we didn't leak it," he added, as a senator's impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and it had leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein argued that the leak did not come from his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's charges, I'm not leaking the story," said Feinstein against the committee, delivered Hill.
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it as secret as his request."
But his refusal was not approved by the president, who commented during the relic on Saturday night: "I will tell you, it is a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continued his defense against the potential Supreme Judge, who was accused of sexual harassment of three women, was impressed by the claim of Democrats to use charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take over power in various ways.
You see evil, evil, they don't care who they hurt, they have to walk for power and surveillance," mediaite report on the president's speech.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants when confronted with Dundee
Dundee Stars redeemed defeat on Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3-score stable match on Saturday.
Giant gets two goals ahead first after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought a balanced host before Dwyer returned the Giants.
Francois Bouchard represented a position for Dundee before two goals Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
That was the defeat of the elite League this third season of Adam Keefe's men, who succeeded in pursuing a failure and finally took off to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
That's the fourth meeting this season between the two sides, with three Giants wins in the previous match.
Opener from Dwyer attended in the fourth minute at 3:35 of the bait given by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford giving the bait when Beauvillier succeeded in multiplying the four minutes ahead.
In the thick opening period, Sullivan brought the host back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became a baiter for the balance that Cownie made at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Giants was superior at the time of the first pause when he left his goal of the second night at the end of the first period.
The host of the house reunited and Bouchard again balanced their position with the goal power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen give the lead to Dundee for the first time at the end of the match in the second period and he ensured victory with his team in the middle of the fifth during the final period.
Giants, who so far had suffered four defeats of their five games, were in the cage to face Milton Keynes at their next match on Friday.
Air traffic guides died to secure hundreds of passengers on a safe flight from the earthquake
An air traffic guide in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after his death while ensuring that a plane that carried hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
Over 800 people have died in the world and many others have disappeared after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering the tsunami.
A powerful earthquake continues to shake the area and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of the tree.
But despite his associates escaping for their safety, 21-year-old Anthonius the Great Gunan refused to leave his post in a rocking guide tower at the Sis Al Jufri Mountain Airport, Palu.
He chose to survive to make sure that Air Base Flight number 6321 was at that time on runway, able to take off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic guide tower when he felt that the tower was starting to collapse.
He died after he was in the hospital.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian Navigation Service Agency, Yohannes Siriat, made his decision to save hundreds of lives, reports from ABC Australia news.
We set up a helicopter from Balykchy in California to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter made it to the tree.
"We're all sad to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authority concerned that the victim died could reach thousands after the National Disaster Corps provided access to Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
"The carnage is believed to continue to grow because many victims are still in ruins and many others are unattainable," said the national body spokesperson for the disaster disaster attack Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that reach six meters have made the wild cross tree that caused mass funerals on Sundays.
The military and commercial aircraft provide help and various supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries a body.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets everywhere are being jailed"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This has become a tragedy, but it can probably get worse."
President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the entire evacuation-related task.
Ready?" report CNN.
Indonesia was also hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed over 550 people earlier this year.
Mikronesia plane crash: The Niugini air sends one missing person after the lagoon plane crash
The air carrier operated a flight that fell to the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia sent one person to disappear, after which 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated safely from the drowned plane.
The Niugini water delivered at a Saturday afternoon release, which cannot identify a male passenger.
The airline said that its side had worked with the local authority, the hospital and the examiner to find the man.
The airline does not respond quickly to more detailed requests about the passenger, such as his age or his citizenship.
Local boats help rescue passengers and other crews, after the plane hits the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The officer delivered on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported six passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both reported landing in the lagoon around the runway.
Some witnesses feel that the plane overpasses the runway.
U.S. passengers Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's really a good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others had successfully flown the water as high as the belt through the emergency exit on that sinking plane.
She gave the flight attendants panicked and yelled, and she suffered a little head injury.
The U.S. Navy says that fishermen who work close to the repaired docks also help rescue using rubber boats to transport people to land before sinking at depths of about 30 meters (100 feet) in water.
The data from the Flight Security Network indicates 111 people have died in the accident of the PNG-registration company for the last two decades but not one involved in the Niugini Air.
Analysts reveal the women's nightline burned alive
The arrest of the events that took place on Saturday in re-examination of a man accused of making a living burn against a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett witnessed for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made a big line for the jury about how he used cell phone footage to collect the various movements that the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received the location data from some mobile phone that showed Tellis was in one location with Chambers on the night of his death, compared to the previous defendant's statement, announced by Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed the defendant's cell phone was in one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked about Sanford.
Sanford followed the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in the city on the day of the incident.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was honest when he said that he was in the Sanford truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "false, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistence that Tellis conveys is his statement that he knows Chambers about two weeks until the death of the victim.
Cell phone records indicate they know each other within a week.
Rowlett points out that after Chambers' death, Tellis sometimes deletes the message, calls and contacts of Chambers' information from his phone.
"He removes the victim from his life," said Hale.
The announcement is scheduled to begin the closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would lead to the jury after that day.
The High Breed: What's the hip hop spirit?
A trio hip hop group wants to challenge such negative views by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims hip hop moves away from the origin of political messages and forces social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip hop spirits popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen the resurrection recently in the UK through some artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
NY nanny demands a couple for attacking after issuing a "racialist" message
A New York Nanny demands a couple for having discreetly attacked after receiving an indirect message from a mother who complains that she's "another black man."
The couple refused if they considered it racist, and considered it more like "glorification."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her anxiety when she realized that the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was her only black skin on her first day of work in 2016.
"I don't care about other people," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, stated that they were taking out the nanny, who was a mixed African-American citizen, for having done an ugly job and he was more expecting the Philippines, based on the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid a day’s work and was later returned to Uber.
Now, Maurice is demanding compensation for the dismissal, and seeks compensation for about $350 a day for a period of six months, in exchange for the cost of the babysitting work that he had to work at first, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do something like that," he said to the post on Sunday, then add "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple fight claims that they're racist, declaring the fired worker Maurice is a good thing to do, they're worried they can't trust him after he's offended.
"My wife has sent me something she doesn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Posts.
"But can you let your children be cared for by someone you've been rude to, even if it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
It's like "glorious," says Plasco's wife just two months to give birth to her baby and is in a "very difficult situation."
"You're going after someone who's in such a condition?
It's not a good thing to do," investment banker adds.
As the legal case continues, the public court has conducted a quick rape against the couple on social media, blaming their attitude and logic.
Publisher Paddington worried the reader won't have anything to do with a talking bear, new newspaper revealed
His daughter Bond, Karen Jankel, was born not far after the book was accepted, explained in a letter. "It's hard to talk only without knowing the position he was going through, read it first before publication.
Very funny to know as we know about the great success of Paddington."
Said his father, who was BBC's cameraman before inspiring through the writing of a child's book with a bear toy, who was very optimistic about the results of his work that had been rejected, he added the 60th anniversary of the book's publication that felt "sick" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father quite proud of his success.
"He is quite quiet, and he is not arrogant," he said.
"But because Paddington means a lot to him, it's like you have a kid who's got something: you're proud of them even though it's not all your effort.
I think he's looking at Paddington's success like that.
Even though it was the result of his creation and imagination, he always praised Paddington himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say good-bye to her on the phone.
By the time she landed, her daughter was soon taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctors failed to save her.
"Nad made a quiet call to convey it was really bad. That she probably wouldn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperose.
"Then I got a call from Nad stating he'd be dead in two minutes ahead and he asked me to say good-bye to him.
And so did I.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors have given to keep his heart steady slowly running out and leaving his body system.
He's been dead a few while the handling process's going on and everything's going to be dead.
I can just sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I can't cry, or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really have to hold it all."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - without realizing what had gone through it.
"No one knows," he said.
"My head is drowsy and my tears keep dripping all the time.
It's very difficult to explain, but when on the flight I felt such deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her."
The grieving women posted cards to prevent suicide at the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones tried to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspiring messages and contactable numbers to get support.
The boy Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he started to suffer from depression and suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45-year-old, who lives in Lydney, says that her son is a chef who promises with a smiling smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always say that their smiles brighten the mood."
But, he quit working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, brother Tyler, then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I keep worrying if there will be any lasting effects."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone else out there that you can get close and talk, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to go through it: "That's what makes a hole in the family.
It separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in uncertainty when the FBI starts the investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking for--a time-limited investigation, restricted his coverage--we might be able to bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee was destroyed in the middle of the council decision.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their obedience is due to time.
Five more weeks left for legislative elections, on November 6th - if, as expected, the Republic did badly, they would become very weak in its opportunity to make the people they wanted to be elected to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him meets his wife Ashley, who is Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There'll be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republics and 49 Democrats sit.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes between the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean residents 'anjlok' under Kim
The number of people drifting from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-un ruled seven years ago, taught a member of the Democratic Republic of Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South ministry data, said there were 1,127 rounds last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that border control between North Korea and Tyeongkok and the higher rates charged by smugglers is the key factor.
Pyongyang didn't give a public comment.
Most Northers were finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said over 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through Tiongkok, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarization Zone between the two Koreas.
Touts treat smugglers as illegal migrants from refugees and often force them to return.
The relationship between the North and the South — who are technically still in the war — has increased greatly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the pending negotiation of the criminalization.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between the President of the United States of America Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in the broad sense to work together on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, there is no way we'll drop our weapons separately," Mr. Ri said in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of "hysterical," said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Party leader Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of "hysterical" and said he didn't fit the temperament to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made that comment in a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't avoid thinking that if a woman performs that way, they'll say 'hysterics'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Board on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally contests the accusation that he's been sexually harassing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they're both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and on several occasions he almost screamed and had trouble talking when discussing his family and his years during high school.
He was also jokingly condemning the Democrats in the committee, saying that the charge against him was "murdering an unreasonable and coordinated character" organized by liberals who were angry because Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh’s witness proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was against Democracy.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and with his attitude toward Clinton and Democracy," he said.
The pelosi said they'd mind if he'd tried to claim that he was approved, and if Democrat got more votes at the People's Council of Representatives.
"I'll say like this -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he doesn't fit just to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court of his place now," said Pelosi.
Cavanaugh is now a judge at the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that he was a Democrat he was worried about the potential of Kavanaugh's decision against the Health Services Union or Roe v. Wade, because he was seen as a conservative accommodating justice.
In the electorate congregation, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for someone who is hysterical and rude to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't it great,' said Pelosi.
And women need to handle it.
It's an ethical claw, anger for months and years, and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry, Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, what do you think?"
He continued, "I am greatly helped by a woman who is an executive somewhere, who says that she also cries when she is angry, but develops a technique that means that she is angry and starts crying, she will say to the person who is speaking to her, "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he went on.
And I think it's brilliant."
The tears were shed as a way out of his anger partly because he was basically misunderstood.
One of my most powerful memories of early work, in a man - dominated office, at one time I cried with unexpressed anger, was my back held by an older woman - a cold manager who was always a little scared - who dragged me to the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they think they're successful."
Patricia Schroeder, a congressman from Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an affair outside of marriage on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Miss Schroeder, very frustrated, understood that there was no reason for himself not to run for president.
"That was not a mature decision," he said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There have been seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called it "Swallow Princess and Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was too late in the campaign, he was left in the fundraiser, and so he swore he would not follow the election unless he managed to collect $2 million.
It's a final battle in defeat.
He found that some of his supporters gave $1,000 to men just gave him $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
When he made a speech saying that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was too overwhelmed by the emotions--thanks to those who supported him, frustration with the system that made fundraising so difficult and to target voters than delegates, and anger against sexism-- made it difficult to talk.
"You might think I'm too nervous," recalls Miss Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You'll think that Kleinex is my sponsor company.
I remember, think, what would they write in my nest?
"She's crying?"
How the US-Tiongkok trade competition may be good for Beijing
The opening of the US-Tingongkok trade competition is so intense, and when the fight is still far from over, the gap between the two countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, according to the expert.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, fired the first warning earlier this year by charging Tiongk key export goods including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
A very significant event took place this week with a new tariff that affected goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods entering the U.S. through Tiongkok.
Beijing has paid back every time, recently charged five to ten percent of the U.S. worth of $60 billion.
Tyeongkok has begged to unite the United States one-by-one, and the world's second-largest economy will not change in the near future.
Calling Washington to retreat means following the will, but publicly referring to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, US trading pressures can support Tyeongkok positively in the long run by reducing the dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that the rapid political decisions of Washington or Beijing can create conditions that trigger economic movements in both countries is more likely than what has previously been learned," said Abigail Grace, a fellow researcher who focuses on Asia in the Center for New American Security, an expert institution.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria said that they were ready for a voluntary refugee return and offered help in rebuilding the country that had been destroyed by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in his country were improving.
"Today's situation in the field is more stable and safe thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he says.
The government continued to rehabilitate areas that were destroyed by terrorists to restore them to their original nature.
All the conditions are present now because refugees voluntarily return to the countries they must leave because of terrorism and a comprehensive economic decision that makes their lives day-to-day and their livelihoods as targets.
The United Nations estimates over 5.5 million Syrians have been displaced from their countries since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in that country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild a devastated country.
