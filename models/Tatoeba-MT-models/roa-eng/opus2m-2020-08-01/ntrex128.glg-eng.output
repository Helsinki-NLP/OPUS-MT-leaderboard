The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned "that they take them for monicreques"
Consternation among some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to as AM, by the suggestion that they should change the name for MWP (Member of the Wales Parliament).
The debate came up with plans to change the name of the assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from all over the panorama fear to be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned about the new name "Ring with Twp and Pwp."
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "foo" and "pwp" means "caca".
One member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group's set was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the change of name, but he stressed that from MWP to Muppet there's only one small verbal leap.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced in a similar manner to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on its own members".
The Wales Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed great support for the name of Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the subject of the title of AM, the commission preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received most support in a public consultation.
It seems the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to achieve consensus might result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, of which you're expected to hand over the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The Reforms Act will include other changes in the functioning of the Assembly, such as the AM disabling rules and the design of the committee system.
The AM will get the final vote on what they should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians attend polls in referendum to change the country name
Voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia".
People's vote will resolve a dispute that has been taking place for decades with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of its northern neighbour represents a complaint from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said he will ignore the vote.
However, the defenders of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is no longer at the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells remain silent while Harlem's churches continue to fight
"The elders I spoke to said that before there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, not one thing or the other."
He said he could understand that the bars were gone.
"Now people socialize in other ways," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms in the neighborhoods where people usually go."
As far as the churches are concerned, the money from the sale of assets doesn't last as long as the leaders expect, and "before or after they'll be back where they started."
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of owners full of the kind of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation changed in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the 125th Street Shop, a commercial street in Harlem that resisted hiring and climbing black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building very damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly named the charillary as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
The University of Michigan's Tiffany Ng expert also pointed out that it was the world's first carillon touched by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it for the largest carillon in Riverside's church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one occupied his place in St. Martin.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin over the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish meeting, the organ that rejects the parish and is made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing its concern that the parish will "result the costs" to the board, although it did not participate in the recruitment of architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the diocese's lack of transparency.
A shark wounds a boy while fishing lobsters in California
The police reported that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was fishing for lobsters in California on the first day of that crustacean season.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help with screams, when he swam with a group of people to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just emotion for fishing a lobster, but he soon realized that he was screaming "I got worked up!
They've worked on me!'
Hammel said he realized when he came to the boy.
"I'll have everyone come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy was transferred to Rady's Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he's in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference to divide a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but determined that it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
The officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to the big warehouses full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable immersion in the UK beauty market, which amounts to 2,800 million pounds and which continues to grow as the fashion sales and household products fall, the largest corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 tents across the country, and then they will move on to others next year if they are successful.
The investment in beauty is produced at a time when supermarkets seek to fill the shelves that occupied televisions, microwaves and household products in their day.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its offer of beauty products to achieve 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Today's L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees collections will also get more space with exclusive zones similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are suitable for vegans, something more and more demanded by the newer customers.
In addition, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will prove concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, in southern London, last week, while the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small shops means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that the settlements will become more and more like shopping malls, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat's sales points in hundreds of stores, since it purchased the two chains two years ago.
The previous attempt at the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the association came to an end after a dispute over how to share the revenues of pharmacies in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was noted that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 tents.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said, "We've transformed the image of our beauty corridors to improve the surroundings for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel that you can turn to for advice.
Our product range is designed to suit all needs and attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "angerful" after Holly Willoughby retired from 11 million pounds business
The star of the Dragons Den program, Peter Jones, left "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby retired from a 11 million-pound business with her lifestyle to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
His company had been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
This morning's 37-year-old presenter used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons' Den, Peter Jones throwing sparks as he withdrew from his lifestyle mark the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicate that Jones was "angried" when the gold girl on television admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new businesses, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant that she had no time to dedicate to the brand of household clothes and accessories of both, Truly.
The business came to compare with Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and it was predicted that it would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, aged 37, turned to Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed for one of his vacation homes.
One source said, "Truly was unlike one of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be your long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave surprised all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a store full of merchandise in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that the abandonment of this Morning's host is among the most profitable stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes and textiles to home, and which could further delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby will become the M&S Ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter on the ITV I'm a Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones declared last night that "We shouldn't comment on their business."
A complicated conversation, and then we fell in love.
He played with the criticisms he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "a president's own" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said by putting his voice on "telexor."
"I gave in to nothing."
He pointed out that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considers a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But the negotiations for denuclearization are stalled.
More than three pesos after the June peak in Singapore, North Korea's chief diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the Saturday United Nations General Assembly, that the North does not see the "correspondent response" by the United States to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
On the contrary, he stressed, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic vision in his rally speech.
"The things with North Korea are going well," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: ending tests with missiles, helping free the hostages and getting the remaining U.S. soldiers back home.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheater, we'd have about 200 people standing here," said Trump pointing out to the crowd he had right ahead.
A earthquake and tsunami devastated an island in Indonesia, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental foreign organizations were informed that they didn't need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an essential condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they will not seek international help, so it is a challenge," said Mrs. Suunku.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it's still unclear whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the voice of the national disaster management agency, has assured that Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to his help.
Given the earthquakes that endure Indonesia constantly, the country is extremely ill-prepared to face the anger of nature.
Although Aceh built tsunami shelters, it's not usually found on other shores.
Even if an alert was issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, travelling among many of Indonesia's islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been deployed in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around the improvement of Indonesia's damaged infrastructure, and donated money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a great lack of funds in the final line for next year's re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by the continued sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of most Muslims have adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were murdered and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the clashes in the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, which use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: The Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the draw goal in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal in the minute 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 meters from Chelsea's portery with his team losing 1-0.
He played the ball with his left leg before throwing a shot at the second pole.
The ball overflew the area as it moved forward towards the top left corner of the network.
The ball finally fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga that jumped into the air and went into the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to organize ourselves, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to earn as much time as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came to Kante and I gave a touch without thinking too much and I just shot."
Chelsea won 1-0 at the break after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored at the 25th minute.
The front of the Blues passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning around the middle change and running into the field of Liverpool..
Kovacic made a wall in the middle of the countryside.
He made a beautiful pass in depth leading Hazard to the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up in the second pole marking a left-wing shot that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool faces Naples at the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton at UEFA Europe League Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of death victims of the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, as reported on Sunday morning the national disaster management agency.
Many people would be trapped in the rubble of the buildings that came down with magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday and which caused waves up to 6 meters, as indicated in a press conference the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with rubble from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman had been stabbed to death.
A murder investigation opened after meeting a woman's body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with white gunshot wounds on John Street, and arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
The police asked people in the area to see or hear something of that step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is at its initial stage, but I'd like to make a call to contact us anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who's seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially the taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera in the box of warrants to contact us, as they could have key information for our investigation'.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belongs to a neighbor of Birkenhead and that it was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believed to know the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where was found that morning.
The investigation continues while the police say they're in the process of informing the closest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that they won't let anyone in or out of the building.
The man ran out of words when he found out what happened.
Residents just know they won't be able to come back in a few hours.
A police officer was heard to tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
A woman crying appears on the scene.
No stop saying 'it's awful'.
At 2 pm there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon watching the block of apartments.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously at the phone number 0800 555 111 quoting record 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell of parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle for "rewriting history"
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by his fanatical and Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion to "shoot" and "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the withdrawal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure located outside Westminster Palace became a target.
The iconoclasty of British civil wars was neither ordained nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor Thomas the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the opinion that existed in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider still worthy of homage.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a parliamentary defender of external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a complete representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What's clear is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance."
A killer pig smashes a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and murdered a farmer in a southwest China market.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the surname, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered with blood near a courthouse in the Liupanshui market, in the province of Guizhou.
A pig goat prepares to put the pigs vaccines in a stable on May 30th, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently he had traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave to another adjacent courtier.
He said in the stable there was a big male with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, nearly 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he was killed.
"My cousin had bloody and torn legs," said the cousin, "Wu," to Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered evidence on the stage.
It seems that the Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although they're not very common, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, producing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig nearly 300 kilos has fastened to a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife has arrived and frightened the animal.
After an Oregon farmer had been devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs don't usually be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "a trigger.
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
You just have to respect them," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring strong and generalized rains to the southwest of the United States.
The forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa is weakened as the cold waters of the north coast of Mexico overlap.
However, Rosa will take torrential rains north of Mexico and southwest of the United States for the next few days.
At 5:00 a.m., east, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was about 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a valley begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and to move eastward, towards the East Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to push tropical humidity northward, which will penetrate the Southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with the fence will create abundant and generalized rains in the southwest in the next few days.
At the local level, rainfall between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause sudden floods, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Great tropical humidity will cause rainfall that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in spot areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest are expected from 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain, especially on much of Arizona.
The possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
We strongly discourage venture in the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
The heavy rains could form cannons that could become floating rivers, and the electric storms would bring locally cracked winds and dust.
The valley will bring locally strong rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
The total rainfall could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause smaller debris flow and slippery roads.
These would be the first rains from the wet station in the region.
Spreading tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the last hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain extends to the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Abundant rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness great temperature swings in the U.S. due to the Arctic's cooling, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This sometimes implies important temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in central America.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country is expected a warm beginning of October, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could have reached 26 degrees on Tuesday, which consists of about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above average to the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw the trial at Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate witnesses of the judge appointed to the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stagnation continues and the prisons interrupt their usual programming for a last-minute Friday new: an agreement designed by the senator by Arizona, Jeff Flake, for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that he's 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh made him feel drunk and tried to take his clothes off at a school party.
In a passionate witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that had not happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen him.
The company counted the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people who watch television from office.
To get an idea, it's a hearing similar to an end of football or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, who largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial the interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure on Friday's television.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement indicating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured by cameras from CNN and CBS on Friday morning by protesters when he was trying to get into an elevator on his way to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He remained with his gaze low for several minutes while being repressed, live television at the CNN.
"I'm here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, "You have the power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said that his office made a Flake statement, before the elevator was closed, he added that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television and cable channels broadcast live hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate to vote.
But Flake said that he would only do that if the FBI were investigating the allegations against the nominee the following week, something that called for a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced of the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of playing politics with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and damaging national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arriving at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking the so-called May Chequers plan for Brexit saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs from the other side was "totally absurd."
Wayde Sims Murdered: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspected of LSU Player Death · Global Voices
The police arrested a suspect of performing the shots that ended up in the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU (State University of Louisiana).
According to Baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder.
The officers broadcasted the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the stage and said they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS's affiliated channel, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said they admitted to being the author of the shooting that killed Wayde.
The defense reported that he was charged with US$350,000 in bail.
The East Baton Rouge parish coroner's office issued a preliminary report on Friday that indicates that the cause of death is a bullet wound in the head that reached the neck.
The department commended the state police fugitives' unit in Louisiana, the state police forensics lab, the Southern University police, for their help in getting the arrest.
The sports director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the forces of local order for his "diligence and search for justice."
Sims was 20.
The 2.01 plane was created in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball trainer, Will Wade, declared that the team was "buried" and "buried" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we're worried about all the time," Wade declared.
Ash volcano about Mexico City
The ashes that the Popocatepetl volcano throws have reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised the Mexicans on Saturday to move away from the volcano after the crater activity was detected and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was overseeing several snores and tremors.
The images of social networks showed thin layers of gray in the windshields of Mexico City as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers south of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 shook Mexico's centre in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Confrontation between the Catalan police and separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters faced the riot police and while thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked proseparatists contained by the police anti-disturbes throwing eggs and paint in dust that created clouds of dark dust in the streets that tend to be crowded with tourists.
There were also refreshments later that same day with the police, who used their asses to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independentist groups that coreed "Ni oblivion or forgiveness" faced unionist protesters who shouted "Long Live Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for slight injuries received in the protest, according to the local press.
The tension continues the skin flower in the independentist region one year after the referendum of October 1st, held by the Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
The voters opted for independence in a suffocating way, although participation was low and the opposites of secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police had tried to stop voting at election tables throughout the region in violent confrontations.
The pro-independent groups camped all Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also took place, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who went to the independent demonstration with his wife, said he had no hope anymore for Catalonia to achieve independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we're busy," he remarked.
Despite obtaining an adjusted, albeit decisive victory, in the regional elections of last December, this year the pro-independent Catalan parties fought for maintaining momentum, with many of their most well-known leaders in self-imposed or detained exile awaiting trial for their participation in the referendum organization and subsequent declaration of independence
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his mobile phone, said that the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"There's more tension every time," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that the following year he would present himself to the elections to the European Parliament.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: They arrest a man after a car hits a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car had stopped several times against a Londonderry house.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 (Summer Time in Britain).
Police investigator Bob Blemmings declared the fence and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It's also possible that a gun was fired at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
The Ascended Livingston surprised the Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as a coach at the club of Iberox.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to climb a level by being placed after Hibernian in second position.
Gerrard's team is still out of the house this year at Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, the Hearts, from which they separate eight points.
But first the Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues to be invincible in the sixth consecutive party division; the main coach, Holt, has not yet known defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller with me.
Livingston allows opportunities to escape from weakened visitors
Holt's team must have moved ahead a long time before the moment they marked it, because with his control they caused all sorts of trouble to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way but his cross-shot did not cross the threshold of the portery; then Alan Lithgow's shot came out driven by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the portery.
The host team was content to let Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put visitors at risk in the standing ball games.
And that's how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers granted a free shot and Livingston carried out a sack in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix the Menga, which played the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time the Rangers dominated the possession but found himself in an impenetrable defense that prevented a lot of work from the Liam Kelly watchman.
That pattern went on in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
Rangers' guard, Allan McGregor heavily held a shot from Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent the ball out in another shot at Livingston's standing ball.
Many cross-passes were planned in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two penalty requests were rejected: one by hand and the other by an entry of Halkett to the Glenn Middleton substitute.
Livingston's phenomenal analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from stadium Tony Macaroni
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
And unanimously, they were excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their ascending trajectory.
His style of play and players have only changed since he returned to the highest category, but part of the merit is Holt's by the way he pushed the team from his arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, conducted a perfectly organized defense in a superb manner, while Menga didn't give them a breath all over the party to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers lack inspiration.
Despite working well on occasion under Gerrard's command, on this occasion they didn't reach that level.
They failed the last pass, only managed to penetrate the host team once, a whole call for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany to lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to resolve the relationship between NATO allies.
They have discussed many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
The city gathers the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to receive them in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division before a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies when colliding with a car
A cyclist died in a collision where a car was surrounded in London.
The accident took place near the intersection between the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a transit street from Deptford, south-east of the city, about 10:15 a.m. (Summer Time in Britain).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident takes place months after another cyclist dies in a runaway crash at Childers Street just over a mile and a half of the Saturday accident.
The metropolitan police reported that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
There are street fences and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers are injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation in the high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. (Summer Time in Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, involving eight inmates who are contained in a pavilion.
The officers received attention for slight injuries to the face.
A prison service spokesman said, "People were deployed to specially trained prisons to deal with a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time in jails."
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was known that the prison director had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, riot officers had to go to jail to calm down a revolt in which the staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (dry-affected places could benefit)
It's rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but it's very likely in the early part of next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert, leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday West Arizona to the south and east Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service has indicated in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of depression or tropical storm on a 320-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that extended on a 64-kilometre radius of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Meteorology Service predict 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150l/m2 on the Arizona Mogollón Edge.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Gran Conca could reach up to 25 or 50 liters, with total isolation of 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, Rosa's rain could be a blessing, since the region is very affected by the droughts.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme dry, the second-largest category," said weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Lower California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who still has force of hurricane on Sunday morning, with a wind of up to 136 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and head north to 19 km/h.
The storm is facing cold water in the Pacific and hence losing strength.
For this reason it is hoped that it will touch the land in Mexico with a tropical storm force on the afternoon or the night of Monday.
It could rain heavily in some parts of Mexico, with an important risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall is expected between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, and it is possible to meet up to 250 l/m2," reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and then continue to climb through Arizona and enter south of Utah the last hour of Tuesday's night.
"Rosa's main danger or what's left of it is the heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and the Southwest Desert of the United States," the National Center of Hurricanes reported.
It is hoped that these rains will lead to sudden waves of water and spills of debris in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous lands.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder and found a 16-year-old boy with white gunshot wounds.
The teenager was found wounded in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 4:00 (Summer Time in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains "stable."
According to Somerset police, three boys aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested at Radstock during the night.
The officers asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the cell phone of the incident.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh ‘suffered the misery and anger’ of the Democratic Party
"To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump declared that Kavanaugh "suffered the poorness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexually assaulting her decades ago, being teenagers.
Ford also testified in the trial about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that day the "Americans" witnessed the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best judges of our time with a history of impolite public service," he said addressing the crowd of admirers of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of Republican results in half-term elections.
"It takes five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't do it, but I really do it," he said.
"That's why I go around fighting for big candidates."
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is to "oppose and hinder."
It's expected that the first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment will take place before Friday, according to CNN, a Republican Party Assistant indicated.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia causes hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke on the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the village of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke into the skylight, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"Yesterday, when the threat arose, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, voicer of Indonesia's BNPB disaster relief agency in a round-up in Iacarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, logs, houses, dragged everything he found," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs broadcast by the national disaster management agency showed many tents and destroyed buildings, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued shaking the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said that the energy released by the huge earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, seated at the end of a long, narrow bay, was able to magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantious" and said that thousands of homes, shopping centers and hotels had come down.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of fallen buildings, he declared, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and the damage could be greater along the north coast of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely paralyzed and there's no information" from Donggala, Nugroho added.
There are over 300,000 people living there," reported the Red Cross in a communiqué, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a video of a amateur sharing on social media, you can hear a man on the last floor of a building shouting frantically warning people on the arrival of a tsunami in the street.
In a matter of minutes the water collides against the tanning leading forward buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that caused the cut-off of communications throughout Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
The authorities claim that the army has already started sending cargo aircraft from Iacarta and other cities, but the evacuated continue to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport was reopened but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The balance of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds the figure of 800.
It's terrible.
On the way to the city of Palu, where the employees rescued themselves in canvas shelters raised in the courtyard of his office, watched scenes of total devastation, commented Mr. Dosebah.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of assisting in the event of a disaster, some complained that they were preventing Palu from travelling to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staffing from foreign sources can only flow if the place of calamity is declared a national catastrophic zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Arriani, a voice of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can open ourselves to international aid, but it's not yet arrived."
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, relatives and friends of the missing people would cling to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that eased the depressing argument of natural disasters."
On Saturday they pulled a child out of a sink.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the paragliders missing for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped at the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the parapentist community, he had desperately tried to send messages from WhatsApp to Palu competitors, who were participating in the beach festival
However, only one gray mark was shown in the messages instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages haven't been delivered," he added.
Robban $26,750 while loading a cashier at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was charging a cashier at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
In the press release, investigating officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptyed a cashier in the leisure complex and prepared to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole from him a bag of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the stage, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about your identities, contact the Newport police by calling number 859-292-3680.
Kid Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Kid Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
It's been some time since West, 41, is known to Ye's nickname, which he used as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change took place before his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new Yandhi album.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who cancelled his attendance by "emotional reasons", according to the creator of the program.
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," he said that same year West as he talked about his record with the radio presenter Big Boy.
"So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
I went from Kanye, which means the only, to Ye alone, which is a reflection of the goodness in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is another of the famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
An old Western collaborator, JAY-Z, also picked up and removed the script and using capital letters.
AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has pledged not to use military force against civilians when the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students comes.
López Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "he would not use the military to suppress the Mexican people again."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly help to boys studying and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag boys to criminal gangs.
US should double investment in I.A.
According to AI Kai-Fu Lee's professional and investor, ex-employee of Google, Microsoft and Apple, the US should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China's growing activity in the field.
The comments came after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. lacks a formal strategy on AI.
In the meantime, China presented its plan the previous year: it intends to be number 1 in innovation in AI in 2030.
"Dualizing the budget in research in AI would be a good start, as the other countries are far behind the U.S., and we're looking for the next great advance in AI," said Lee.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next AI achievement would be done in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Innovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent Chinese AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the American Othello player with the highest score and later was executive at Microsoft Research of the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized old U.S. government technology contests as the Robotic Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Agency and asked when it would be the next one to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers usually have to work a lot to get government scholarships, says Lee.
"China is not taking academic leaders, but companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university geniuses to work in AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the United States push its efforts into AI.
"I think they should offer residence cards to the doctors in AI," he said.
The Chinese Council of State published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China offers funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an artificial intelligence center which is designed to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, you currently invest over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that was looking to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not been moving for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum if they change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wanted to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute with Greece for decades and block applications for admission in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbours represents a complaint from its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries came to an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents claim that the change would prejudice the ethnic identity of most Slavic people in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he won't vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the result will achieve the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum paper was: "Are you in favour of accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Advocates of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying to be admitted to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 75-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it's not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament have said that they would heed the result of the vote and make it final.
The change of nine would need a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission stated that at 1 p.m. there had been no irregularity.
However, participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our site is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the Macedonian referendum on the change in the name of the country that would pave the way for his accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarvarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents for whom the referendum was boycotted.
"We're in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads high and not through the service door," added Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says that accession to NATO will bring the much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of entry into the EU and NATO," Zaev commented after he voted.
He said a positive result would be "confirming our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required figure.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people consulted planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said he'd vote.
For the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it had access to power in May of the a in the past.
View: Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, runs through Brighton's entire defense and ends by scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling reported on Brighton's defense with 2-0 from Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
That made it seem ridiculously easy to mark the 65 minute goal.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before heading into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green sweaters.
It turned out to be a defense before overcoming several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
Next, he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English forwarder used the first touch of the area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit the Brighton Mathew Ryan's locker with a shot to the right of the network.
"He's still going through some problems on the foot," said the City's coach, Pep Guardian, to the reporters.
"We're talking about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky to have her mark at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Blucelests the initial advantage in confronting the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Agüero received the ball in the depth of Brighton's field in that game.
He sent a beautiful pass through the gap on the right side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite pole.
The blues put the ball in the front yard before they left the camp.
The City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies' party.
With the Nationals out of the struggle for elimination, there wasn't much reason to force another title.
But a always competitive Scherzer expects to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there's still implications for the Rockies, that bring an advantage game to Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League Division.
The Rockies have secured at least one wildling position with victory 5-2 on the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to close their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can touch the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably be playing at the highest level I've played this year.
Why won't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the opening man on Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to Scherzer to be the one who throws into a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his number 34 start, did another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch Sunday on his usual rest day.
Washington's right is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump celebrates a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of the result in the half term elections.
"We played everything we did in November.
It's five weeks away for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is something great, great... I don't have a job, but I really do and that's why I'm going all over the world fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this terrible radical group of Democrats, look at what's happening now.
And they're determined to regain power by any means necessary, evil, and mean.
They don't care who does harm, over who has to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're never going to give it to them."
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and hinder."
"And you've seen that for the past four days," he said, qualifying Democrats for "frozen, valves, repulsive and liars."
He listed to the Senate Judicial Committee quoting Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong apospossessions from the public.
"Remember your answer?
Filter Document?
Mmm. Let's say what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer so open.
He is not tolerant of those who express his opinion
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censure me, the truth is, I wasn't too surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a series of Labour MPs that we're not well received, and all by saying our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because he faced a decisive anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, occasionally issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The nottingham East Labour Meeting notification Friday indicated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a Labour Member, the Friday night meetings of the committee were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, that's no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy has been forgotten a long time ago, if it ever began.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged whether all opinions are acceptable to the party's leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when fellows who believed to share a similar political vision began to expect him to portray me and adopt positions with which he would never agree, both in terms of national security and in the EU's single market.
When I speak publicly, and in fact it's somewhat the same as I say, there's a tremendous shock and attacks on social networks censoring downtown politics, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know that I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments that go to me tend to be of a political nature.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of the fellows who face a stream of sexist or racist comments every day and who don't give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult were normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer so open and that with every movement of "untrusted" or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower in sight.
Over the past few years, I've received a lot of advice that I'm trying to keep my head down, not be so frank and then "all would be fine for me."
But I didn't get involved in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party there have been 32 still in school, led by the negligence of Thatcher's government that literally dropped out of my class, I've tried to demand better public services for those who need them most, both as local concierge and government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused about my political positions and I don't agree with the party's current leadership.
To those who promoted the Friday motion, all I'd say is that as the country walks towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat or political convenience will deter me from acting according to what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An Invict Ayr Is Headed · Global Voices
The last two attempts may have changed the final result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this easy party of the Tenent Premier League.
Now they lead the table and it's the only invict team of the ten.
Finally it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the risking, that the team took him to victory, and the coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far we've been tested in our party and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said, "It must be acknowledged that Ayr has taken advantage of opportunities better than ours."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute essay, transformed by Frazier Climo, put forward the Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, handed over to the Warriors party, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot caught a wrong launch.
Climus increased the advantage to the Ayr with a penalty, before he, just in the middle of time, turned a single shot, leaving the 17-5 marker in favor of the Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started well the second half and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop for the serious injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, who abandoned the camp into a palpable and, since his reinitiation, Ayr advanced further through an essay by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Captain d'Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having one more player with an essay by Bruce Colvine that was not consumed at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the local team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for plating Climo when he didn't have the ball, McPjherson scored an essay from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climus marked, as he did almost since the reboot, after Kyle Rowe had collected the launch in the David Armstrong area and had sent him to Gregor Henry's third line to get the fifth essay from the local team.
Still Game's protagonist begins a new career in the restoration industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after discovering that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who writes and co-protagonizes with his old partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the final one, and it seems Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, although a Scottish Sun source insinuated that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "prosperity restaurant business" in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': inner Bolivia expects the court to go the way to the Pacific
The sailors watched a naval headquarters covered in apparatus in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are flooded with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty."
In Bolivia without sea, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th century resource conflict remains alive, just as the yearning to sail back through the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia expects an international court decision on October 1st after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the CIX ruling on giant screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Court will speak in favour of Bolivia's complaint and that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, is also at stake in the Monday sentence.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would justify Bolivia, and that it would change little if that happened.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to adjugate Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
The fact that the CIX sentence comes only six months after the final arguments we hear indicate that the case "was not complicated," says the Chilean international law expert Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could have delayed it.
"The issue of access to the sea has long been blocked by the present Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined the goodwill of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume conversations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court would make an unusually rapid decision.
On Monday Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open up a new phase of relations with Chile," and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this theme for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"Decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can be trusted in the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong declares that his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if he cannot trust Washington.
Laughed on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment is being made at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the stagnant nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims it's "a utopia" that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to a declaration that ends the Korean War can bend north.
In Washington he refused to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second start.
But there's generalized skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in the shops.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or it is covered in full sun, do not look any more.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in the walkway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that amazed the public in the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers pulled out their most amazing creations to the gateway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated hat bee adorned with a wide fan imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other accessories of great size were weaned sandals, a magician's hat and even a pine, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high seam.
One of the creations looked like a complete dive team, with the glasses and the tube, and another a melted ice-cream cone.
And if you're a fan of huge fashion, you're lucky.
The trendy ones predicted that giant hats could reach the shops.
The disproportionate hats come right after the "Bomb", the straw hat with a 60-inch fan that takes everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark that is behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks took out the gateway another great creation: a beach bag of straw almost as large as the matted model with a bathing suit that carries it.
The orange rabies bag adorned with rabies flakes and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera's spring-summer 2019 collection on Paris Fashion Week.
The designer of famous Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I hope the big hats and beach bags arrive at the shops next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories'.
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential to the citizens of the world.
Scotland's private schools maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in the exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS for their English acronyms), strive to offer the best level to students and their parents.
The aim of private schools is to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak a man in a language he understands, that comes to his mind.
But if you speak to him in his own language, he will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of recent exams this year, we can see that languages are on the top of the board and with higher approval rates in private schools.
About 68% of the students who studied foreign languages obtained an outstanding degree.
The data, compiled from the 74 SCIS schools, show that 72% of students obtained a degree of honor in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding degree.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are having the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private school programs and of all kinds.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 indicated that among the lack of knowledge of languages is 17% of the reasons why employers are struggling to fill vacancies.
So language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more work opportunities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, learning a second language will have a real advantage in the future with a lifetime skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% didn't speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, teaching languages differ according to school.
Some schools focus on the most classic modern languages, while others focus on languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what your children's interests are, private schools always have several languages to choose from and specialist teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future may be.
We cannot deny that at present, in a global business environment, languages remain of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do this right.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of private schools.
Lebron starts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the eveningrs who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with Los Angeles Lakers.
The team trainer, Like Walton, announced that James will play the initial preeminent match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still up to you to decide how many minutes you'll be playing.
"It'll be over 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers' website.
The Lakers' reporter, Mike Trudell, posted on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After the beginning of the week training, James was asked for his plans for six Lakers matches.
At this point in my career I don't need preeminent matches to be ready," he said.
Trump's election events arrive in Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He'll be the first of Trump's 5 scheduled rallies for next week, including stops in nearby cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a standing vote of confirmation for your candidate to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump seeks support for the next half term elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia and how can you see it on the Internet?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can see Trump's rally in West Virginia next via live stream via YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with the issue of the trial held this week to the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense by the accusations of inappropriate sexual conduct and who keeps the Senate's confirmation vote suspended for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main objective of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans face the November elections with a new impetus.
So these five Trump rallies next week aim to "dynamicize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," says Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible towards the campaign season," said Reuters a Trump campaign spokesman who preferred not to be appointed.
Tonight's rally, to be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could gather supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate from West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president must come to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a polytologist from the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until the individual Sunday parties
After three individual sessions, the forsom of Saturday afternoon might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating pendulum of impulse is a completely invented sport concept but in what athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would they say the impulse is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now there are four, so I suppose we're taking that as a little boost," said Jordan Spieth as he was leaving at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, said Spieth, feel they have a bit of wind in favor and a lot to cheer up for, among other things, the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each count with three points of four.
Spieth was lethal from tea to green and he's preaching with the example.
Those guttural screams became stronger as he advanced his round, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth match when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
By getting the putt that made them win the game in 15, he made a similar scream, the kind of scream he says he thinks the U.S. team isn't out yet.
"You only have to concentrate and worry about your party," said Spieth.
It's the only thing left to these players now.
18 holes to leave a footprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four or four and they can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That journey, and the way it seems to flow its energy into the crowd and from it, confirms them as the rivals beat on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to achieve a victory when the sun is set on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio García, the hero of the morning's fourballs, when he mated with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first trip ended with the Spanish and Swedish in a hole they were never near to get out.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
The fourballs and the forsomes are so fascinating to see closely the interactions between the couples, the advice they give themselves, the advice they don't and the way in which they can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe played better as a team until now and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this forsomes session has also shown that Team USA has the strength to fight, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe has a 10-6 advantage on Ryder Cup's last day.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after coming out of the fourballs and forsomes with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty to climb four points to the scoreboard at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who seeks to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the 3-1 series on.
The U.S. offered more forsome resistance, winning four matches, but they couldn't cut the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood, after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points of the four initial matches in Ryder Cup's story.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they fit perfectly to defeat a deflated Woods and U.S. Newman Bryson Dechambeau with a 5&4 more categorical.
Woods, who fought two games on Saturday without merit or glory, showed occasional bursts of brightness, but now lost 19 of 29 matches in the patterns of fourballs and foursomes and five in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning's oven, reunited with her couple Henrik Stenson in the forsomes getting a defeat in front of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three in the world.
Europe couldn't always win on a pleasant day of breeze in southwestern Paris.
The three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the point of reference for Americans getting two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and won Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There was only twice in Ryder Cup's story where a team went up four points in the individual, although as a current trophy holder, Furyk's team just needs to tie it up to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions increased their mistrust in the United States and that the country would not hand over its nuclear weapons in those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho informed the Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures to show its goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test fields and committing to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we don't see the corresponding answer from the U.S.," he added.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first on our part."
While Ri resumed the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to "gradual" denuclearization by which North Korea would be rewarded as he took action, his statement seemed important, since he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to the "unnuclearization" of the Korean peninsula while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has been looking for a formal end for the 1950-53 Korean War since its mother's time, but the United States has stated that first Pyongyang must deposit its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "unnuclearization first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its coercive goal, and even if they oppose the "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream, for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions aggravate our distrust."
Ri didn't mention the plans for the second top between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added, "If the other part of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a point of death."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the "evil president" Trump called Kim a rocket on a suicide mission.
This year in the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking action for disarmament, but said that much work still remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
Wednesday Trump said there was no deadline for it, and that "it's still two years, three or five months."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council that: "The compliance with the sanctions of the Security Council must continue firmly and without exception until we observe the complete, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't work.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that he had made progress, just a few hours before North Korea denounced him for making "mafia requests."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile deployment, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "corresponding measures".
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the " corresponding measures" he was asking for were the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
This year, a new Harvard University course is making all of your students sleep more in order to combat the growth of male culture from studying all night long stimulated by caffeine.
An academic found that college students number one in the world often do not know the basics about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and a specialist at Brigham and Muller Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of this type in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact the lack of sleep had on learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl approached me and said, 'Why are you only telling me this now, in my last year?'
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of the university's health services, said that the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had an important lack of sleep during the week.
The course of one hour implies a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there's a picture of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine in bed.
In another section, participants are informed how prolonged sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
An interactive icon-based campus map encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we think you have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride of spending all night awake still exists, he says, and he adds that modern technology and increasing pressure for students who implied a lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that she sleeps enough and that she has a good sleep quality must be a student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, pointed out. Even avoid getting fattened, as lack of sleep causes her brain to enter in mode of inanition, which makes her starve constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to drive a course across the campus.
The next step, waits, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm to lie down, as well as when they wake up. Similarly, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lighting, which can debalance the circadian rhythm and cause trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal overthrows Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The team wanted to record their first home victory since the 4-1 win in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team led to Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which left his team eight points behind by the Hearts, leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and a low-inspired alignment of the Rangers never gave the feeling that he was going to draw.
While the Rangers descended to the sixth post, the Livingston went up to the third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a goal of difference.
And it could have been a lot worse for the Rangers after the judge of the Calum Spence line had to have treated for a head wound after the supposed launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that destroyed the Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 from Livingston that drew a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his entire organization suffocated its opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have mastered the possession, but Livingston did a lot more when they had the ball.
They might have scored in just two minutes when the short pass of Menga's first time sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's door, but the camper wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful shot free of Keaghan Jacobs arrived at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him to the second pole.
The Rangers took over, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
No doubt Alfredo Morelos felt they'd have had to be penalized at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only fired two shots at the door in the first half, but the old guard from Imbox, Liam Kelly, barely had any trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head end and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While the opening of Livingston in minute 34 might have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers failed again in the face of Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put in the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his blood cold to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted on the break by changing Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, turning that almost had an immediate effect when the left hand passed to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to devour the visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up a long ball after another.
Holt's team might have expanded the advantage at the end of the day, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, called for another penalty when he got tangled with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes around again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and CONTACT... was the day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pyramid of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
By putting on these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Say, I'm sure you're bursting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer and re-inject it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "pulses the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
An approach similar to the extraction of immune cells from patients and "teaching" to approach cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a Trump speech when using a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance in the Saturday Night Live (SNL) program.
And the result wasn't good.
During a Saturday Night Live program, Kanye West was released in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he commended the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and said that he would run as a candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again hat, criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white guy and say, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?"
If I was worried about racism, I'd be out of the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the program with a satire starred by Matt Damon, in which Hollywood's star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee on the demands for sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, Chris Rock uploaded the images of West's criticism of social networks.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with this publication.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he had had had a bad time behind the scenes because of his cap.
"They passed me behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat'.
I was intimidated!
And then they said I was going to pick it up," said Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to peak?", saying that I'd "put on my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do."
Try it with love."
His comments provoked adjournment at the audience at least twice and the members of the SNL cast seemed to be embarrassed, he informed Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave the publication: "The whole studio was in absolute silence."
They had named West as the last substitute for Big Ariana, whose old boyfriend, Rape Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left a lot of people puzzled by an interpretation of the song I love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier water.
West got the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thanks for FRONTING MAFIA"
However, the host of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was just being who it is and that's totally wonderful.
"So, I chose NOT to reward anyone (buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us," he added.
Before the show, the raptor announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "the being officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name; he follows the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges for attempted murder of stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhacklove, said the police.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will review the charges.
The Star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as handling the sword like Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantastic series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of male hero, saying that these roles on the screen translate into what it seems young people often have to be hard to respect them.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something has failed" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era (#EuTamén).
Kit, who recently married the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he feels "strong enough" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now, when we're wrong about masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
Because, of course, something went wrong with the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he won't make any play of Thrones sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that it's enough horses and battlefields.
From November, Kit will feature a replacement of True West (the true West) by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers his encounter with his wife, Rose, to be the best of Game of Thrones.
"I've met my wife in this show, so, in a way, she provided me with my future family and my life from here on," she said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, declared the health authorities.
40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has been rapidly spread by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, in annual terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies a staff member leaking data from Republican Party senators, "dangerous liars" and "conspirator theories"
On Saturday, U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three U.S. Republican Party senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and commentators of the "ultraright".
"True lies, lies, and more infamous lies," Waters remarked in a Twitter statement.
According to reports, the information broadcast included the private addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, the headquarters of the U.S. government, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of improper sexual conduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came up a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed the information of a staff member of Waters, the Capitol Hill reported.
"This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie."
The Waters statement immediately sparked online criticism, including those of the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This lying man was angry," Fleischer wrote.
"It means he has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something he hasn't done, he mustn't be angry.
You mustn't be challenging.
You mustn't question the defendant's motives.
It must remain pleasant and with serenity."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Kavanaugh Democrats, whom critics accused of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to untie Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if true" shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said that his department alerted "the law enforcement entities and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent charges.
"We will make sure to discover the culprits," he continued, "as well as that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and every member of my team."
Johnny's Criticism English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in Action), Rowan Atkinson's Powerless Spy Parody
It is already traditional to look for Brexit's transcendence in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the franchise of this parody and comedy of action of Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire become about the matter of the evidently stupid we are at the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, Johnny English's incompetent jump-eyed and rubber-faced character renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general comic creation designed for non-anglophone film territories.
Of course, it's the silly secret agent who, despite his pernicious claims of agile glamur, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a piece of that guy who contributed with a single note on the theme of Fire Cars at the 2012 London Olympic opening ceremony.
It's also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once interpreted in Barclaycard's now forgotten television ads, where he sowed chaos in his footsteps.
There are a couple of good moments at Johnny English's last exit.
I love it when Johnny English comes to a helicopter while he's wearing a medieval armor suit and the rotor steps make a brief crash against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy leaps into view, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when these "serious" movies, like 007 and Mission Impossible, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if humor was aimed at children instead of adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant misfortunes are not as clever or concentrated as Atkinson's film jokes change when he incarnates Bean's character.
Now the permanent topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate infiltrates Britain's supersecret web spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the anguish of the service agent, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the culmination for a pompous and conflicting prime minister, who has already suffered a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself with this character who almost looks like Theresa May, but can't do much with the script.
His intelligence advisors inform that as all active spies have committed themselves, they must remove someone from the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher at some snob institution, but gives off-office lessons on how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meet with their former and suffering partner Bough, reinterpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a sea captain, an enthusiastic paper in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of the mistakes of His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, meeting the beautiful fatal wife of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the multi-millionaire technology charismatic who claims that he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hatred of ridiculous falcatrusades: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a ostentatious French restaurant; they create a tumult that illegally puts them on board the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
Obviously, all arrests come out of that last sequence, but in the kind and scandalous way it is, it seems to be taken out of a children's television show.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help thinking: the British film industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but it covers for five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but cover for five
Presumably, the party wants entrepreneurs to pass on the savings achieved through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers offering them an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would still get the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "adjust" the party's economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country to the benefit of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported four days a week's shifts as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen from day to night, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that adjusts to the focus of the party to balance the economy for the worker, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the Labour Party currently does not support ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesperson said, "A four-day workweek doesn't get into party politics and is not being considered by this one."
The shadowed chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to strengthen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of the anonymous directors and speculators in public service companies.
The chancellor's shady plans also imply the possibility that the current shareholders of the water companies won't recover all their investment, because a Labour government could make "deductions" because of the perceived irregularities.
It has also confirmed the plans to place workers on business councils and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of private sector companies' shares to employees, who charge annual dividends worth up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation about Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least a week's final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court.
On Sunday, on the broadcast of an interview, the reporter for "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy's been more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'd go to the audience, and I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charge came out and asked him if he had.
It was firm, determined, round."
However, Graham's vote seems to be unmovable.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is decided and would make an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett flatly denied it," added Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive poster of stars to act and an equally impressive mission, to end world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people visiting the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other significant way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by the 12-year-old Global Citizen in achieving their goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading people to ask for measures or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism," people who think it makes a difference when signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, pushing a set of different goals.
It states that these actions helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set up to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and ads derived from their shares, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor and executor society that has committed itself to "help children develop to their maximum potential," with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, the donors, the national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote to history," said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with interventions on nutrition.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said, "It will be a long and difficult road and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, just as it happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will be performing at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to perform a "block" to hinder energy exports from Russia, announced the US Secretary of Interior
"If necessary," Washington could resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including that in the Middle East, unveiled the US Secretary of Interior, Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where the legitimate government is operating, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason why they're in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did it in Eastern Europe," he said, as reported.
Besides, according to the officer, they have the means and the means to face it.
"The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke then addressed the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called himself the "energy consumer voice" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to dealing with Russia and Iran, taking into account that, in practice, it's about the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to exploit and replace fuels," he commented, at the same time referring to Russia saying that he has only one tactic with an oil-dependent economy.
The statements were made while Trump's administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia's, the most economical option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump's administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unreasonable" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a "cactuary" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 oil pipeline of $11 billion, which has been established to double the capacity of the existing oil pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, after the meeting with the US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who took place in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States got Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry's leading organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI, for its German acronyms), called on the United States to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, President of the BDI, following a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine her presidential candidacy in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
On Saturday, the Massachusetts senator, Elizabeth Warren, said he would carefully examine his candidacy for the presidency after half-term elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair the broken government and that includes a woman in power," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I shall carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency."
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump during the public assembly, stating that he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet, "Of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote."
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it was shown that most of Warren's own voters don't think they're going to show up in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator would not apply, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the so-called candidacy.
The survey showed more support for the former governor's candidacy, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other prominent names of the Democrats in relation to a possible candidacy in 2020 include former vice president, Joe Biden, and senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd officially decide before January, reported the Associated Press agency.
Sarah Palin quotes the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTTE) of Track Palin in Donald Trump's myth
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of a domestic violence incident
"With what my own son is going on, with what is going on again, I can see myself reflected in other families who sense the consequences of the TEPT and some of the wounds our soldiers return to," he explained to the audience at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that his arrest was a taboo issue and that his son and other veterans of war, "come back different, hardened, wondering if there is respect for what militia and airmen, as well as other members of the army, offered the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon at the same time as he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal remedy in relation to a new American policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, 18 state representatives and the district presented a friendly report from the court in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the petitioner for Grace's Sessions price v. that the American Civil Liberties Union (U.S. Union for Civil Liberties) presented in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He said that his partner "and his children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officers refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum-seekers for the United States, as nations facing generalized problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy " ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be acquitted according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition violates that principle," was explained in the court's friendly report.
The prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy that rejects immigrants' entry harms the American economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they "supply labour".
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
" asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in their political announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems (even all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a career to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse and worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her febrile baby in the evacuation center of the slaughtered city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
And the clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their drowned belongings, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5, are flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured their backs and shoulders, rested outside Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I believe," told Haris the Associated Press, and added that his family was at a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope you're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of abusing it with "propagandistic ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in an American newspaper calling for the benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, referred to the pay supplement China Daily at the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of joining the US Congress elections, which will be held on November 6, which has been denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get into the U.S. elections, marked what the officials of that country went to Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
Although it's normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war as a witness to tariff levelling on their respective imports.
According to experts from China and the United States, China's compensatory tariffs at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to prejudice state exporters like Iowa, who support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed US workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
In an opinion paper written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, it was stated that China "is intensifying this harassment campaign by broadcasting propaganda advertisements in the free US press."
"When spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the appreciated American tradition of freedom of expression and of the press when publishing an announcement of payment at the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the post of newspapers located at the end of this Beijing street, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese can have on the worrying economic trajectory of China, since the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
Similarly, he states that "one of the most important newspapers in China declined the offer to publish" his article, although it did not confirm what newspaper it is.
Kavanaugh's disaster is wasting the Republican women's vote a few days from mid-term election.
Although many of the main Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the different charges of sexual assaults, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially to female voters, in the next half term elections.
The reactions around these accusations were numerous and most Republicans positioned themselves to carry on with the vote.
"These things cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell school of Syracuse University in an article published on Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last hour for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the moods of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future nor in November," said Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, in the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the opponents, to the flu of "Arrive November!", protested in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans, with the control of the Judicial Committee, decided to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will overcome any expectation," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"It's true it's already high,
But it's still going to be more, especially among the undecided women voters in the neighborhoods or those who are between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the President, don't usually go to the polls."
Before Ford's public witness detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that it was possible to react violently if the Republicans were continuing with confirmation.
"This became a disaster for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, President of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week on the NBC News channel.
The problem is how the Republicans managed it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps the election of Democrats in the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between believing the Ford or Kavanaugh witness, even though they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of the people surveyed believe entirely or probably the Ford witness, compared to 35 percent who support Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent believe that Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, compared to 30 percent of Ford's thinking.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as those of at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a state of drunkenness when she was 17 years old.
On the other hand, Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him the genitals at a university party when he was studying in Yale in the '80s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a Solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee has chanced that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "on-line personal data store" or POD.
Contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools can be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has full control over who can access what information.
The company describes this as "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to its president John Bruce, is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work in the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that neither he nor his team talked to "Facebook nor Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would modify their business models from one day to the next.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has risen up as an influential voice in the debate about network neutrality.
Even during Inrupt's launch, Berners-Lee is still the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Honor Bernard Vann, clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Church clergyman in England who was decorated with the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918, in the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attack.
However, he was assassinated by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been granted the greatest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandsons were responsible for discovering a memorial in his honor at a parade in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after the feat of his grandfather who deserved the title.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Channel "through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense machine gunfire."
Later he rushed to the line of fire and, with "great courage," led the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without anyone's help, and overthrowing three people from the enemy standoff.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something he could never live with, but a lesson anyway."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a crown of flowers after the parade, which led the Brentwood Imperial youth band.
Michael Vann said he felt "I am honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cuts the scroll to MMA fans at the best time
Imagine that you've been up all night to enjoy the entire Bellator 206, and when the best part comes something stops you.
The San Jose cartel included 13 combats, six of them leading, and was broadcasting live in the United Kingdom in Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald would see their faces, the spectators of the United Kingdom were puzzled when they saw Peppa Pig show up.
Some didn't be impressed after spending so many hours awake waiting to see the fight.
An amateur described the change to these children's cartoons on Twitter as "a joke of very bad taste."
"The state regulations state that this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and that's why it had to be changed to child programming," explained Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication from Bellator, when asked for the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, said they'll take UK viewers into account in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think about repetition," Coker said.
"But if it's 6:00 a.m. there, we can't fix it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
But we're working to find a solution.
When the change came, I started to get a lot of messages and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll limit ourselves to five fights instead of six.
very angry damage."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of her sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete says he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to school.
Guest of the first show of the Desert Island Discs Radio 4 program led by Lauren Laverne, explained that he started talking about homosexual rights to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is on sick leave.
As guest of the first program led by Laverne, Daley shared that he felt "less" to the rest of the people because "it was socially unacceptable that you liked children and girls."
He also said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what pushed me and gave me the necessary strength to achieve success."
I wanted to prove that I was "someone" so that people wouldn't be disappointed in discovering their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in the Commonwealth of Australia games to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to talk because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three times world champion said he fell in love with American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was a whole surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and says the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
"When you live so long in such a short time" (with only 14 years of age, she first participated in the Olympic Games and her father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of your age who had experienced similar heights.
The couple had their first son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley totally change his perspective.
"If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal," he says.
"But now I know there are much more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
Your son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son was a ticket to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front line.
"I couldn't tell you I wouldn't be here to fill that first row," Daley shared.
"He was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and went at that very moment, at the time of his death, when I realized that it really wasn't invincible," he adds.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that was the dream of my life: to jump in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
The selection of Heather Small's Proud song is not in vain either, as it's the melody that accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympics and still puts his hair on top.

A low-form Mickelson ended up in Ryder Cup's bank this Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to improve his technique so that this doesn't turn into an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who took part in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed in the bank on the decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourballs or the forsomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, like so many other times in the United States, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his movements.
Although it was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the moment of their career, at the age of 48 it doesn't fit into the adjusted Le Golf National field, where the tall grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And in case this wasn't enough, Mickelson faced the ninth match on Sunday with the exact Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of the 12 individual matches, they start with a good foot, Mickelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, though he could not say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role he was playing today, gave me a slap in the shoulder, handed me his arm and told me that tomorrow I would be ready," Furyk shared.
"He trusted himself fully.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think I played two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end it's the way things are and so we thought they should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there."
On Sunday, Mickelson will outnumber Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of matches played at the Ryder Cup.
I could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, a race that never reached the level of his individual palm tree.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven halls, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides untenables to the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person, with engineering and he likes to mess with people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I like to see how well the younger players spent it with him this week.
It's a lot more with a good player."
Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup's individual life can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Great Danes debuted in 1997 at a match in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they ended up reaching the goal line with a minimal advantage winning 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still think we had a great advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won for a little while," Bjorn reflected in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this isn't over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go all the way.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This is not finished until the bookmarks are in the bookmark.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I won't get tired of saying it, I'm focused on our 12 players on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the world's best players."
Enchanted by the performance of their players in a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before.
Tomorrow we faced another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It's great to be with a partner next door when things go well, but when you face things individually, then you're putting your ability as a golfer to the fullest test.
That's the message you need to convey to the players, who get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself."
Bjorn's difference, Jim Furyk will seek that his players have a better individual performance than with his colleagues, the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of those last day rounds, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but ending up losing out on the European miracle at Medina.
"I remember every damn word," he answered when he was asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players face to face the last day.
"We have 12 important matches, but you'd like to have a quick start like Brookline's or Medina's.
When you see the impulse goes in a direction, there's a lot of pressure in those middle parties.
We've prepared our alignment by taking this into account and putting the players the way we thought we would, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIllroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, at the top half of the ranking.
"I've decided this order because I think it covers the whole way," Bjorn explained about his choice for the individual.
Germany's new warship postponed once more
The youngest frigate of the German Navy should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it won't be until at least next year due to defective systems and the rising cost, they informed the local media.
The service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leader ship of the flaming frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, postponed until the first half of 2019, as reported a military spokesman to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will count on a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft and anti-ships missiles, as well as hidden technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to spread the newer frigates up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The wretched F125 frigate was reported last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a builder after the delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "cracial defects in software and hardware" that prevented the use of the warship on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, since Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the personnel needed in the old Bremen class frigates.
Besides, it was discovered that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
It is thought that the 7 000-ton Rhineland-Pfalz weighs twice as many ships of similar class as the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It's claimed that it's already reaching the astonishing amount of 3100 million euros, compared to the original 2200 million.
The problems of the newer frigates are especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is watering.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of boats fit to expand.
The official claims that this problem is increasing, since the old ships have been withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
Even so, he regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust spies the secret life of bats
A new investigation that is being carried out at a highlands farm in Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland association will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bats Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An audio analysis carried out by experts from all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what it's doing each species.
Then a habitat map will be drawn up to create a detailed picture on the scale of the landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, expects the results to show that habitat areas are more important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and habitat loss.
The aerogenerators and the ignition also pose a risk, as well as trappings with fly glue, some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks of domestic cats.
The bats are not blind,
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out periodic surveys, inspections of children and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organization even has the only and first reserve of bats in Scotland in Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
David Thompson, manager of Estate, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Three we have a large area for bats," he says.
"We have ancient buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there's a lot of things we don't know about bats yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to prosper."
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance tasks in the properties, since it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternity child could kill up to 400 females and females, which could exterminate a whole local population.
The bats are a protected species and it's illegal to kill them, harass or harass them, as well as destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages people to help:
"There's still a lot to be learned about bats and, in the case of many of the species, we don't know how it's going to its populations."
Ronaldo dismisses rape lawsuits and his lawyers prepare to sue the German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo qualifies the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to get acquainted with using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these charges.
The foreman of Portugal and Juventus was charged with rape of Kathryn Majorga, an American woman, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It's true that the footballer paid the woman 37,000 dollars so she wouldn't say anything about the incident, published Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after his publication, Ronaldo, aged 33, took this false news in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
"No, no and a thousand times not.
What was said today is false," he said in front of the camera the five times winner of the Gold Ball.
"People want to get to know each other by my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by just saying my name, it's part of my work.
I'm a happy and respectable man," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are getting ready to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they call "an inadmissible statement of suspicions in the privacy area" according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident would have happened in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Majorga would have returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her annually, according to the documents presented at the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, kneeled down saying that he was 99 percent a knight, but that 1% had betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that both of them maintained sexual relations agreed upon by both sides.
Majorga also maintains that she came to the police and that she had photographs of the wounded, but later she agreed to an extra-judicial agreement because she felt terrified of reprisals and was concerned about public scandal.
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to revoke the agreement while she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Car manufacturers would leave the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of its position as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK had stated in the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop the production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"It's necessary to reach an agreement," added Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that, in case Brexit didn't come to any agreement, the impact of delays on the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which is responsible for manufacturing the Auris and Avensis models in Toyota, produced some150 000 vehicles last year, of which 90 % was exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we'll be witnesses to how production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, general manager of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers also expressed their fear of abandoning the EU without reaching agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that he would close his Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of supply chain in case an agreement is not reached in Brexit.
Toyota's production line is very tight, every 37 minutes pieces of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU arrive for custom-made cars.
If on March 29, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without reaching an agreement, the border may be affected and delays and shortages of pieces may arise.
The company claims it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace more than one day on the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark claims that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "precisely calibrated to avoid such border controls."
"It is essential to have an agreement, and we want it to be the best agreement, so as to enjoy the current success, but also to make the most of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains."
Toyota couldn't estimate how long production would stop, but he warned that in the long run the costs added would reduce the plant's competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, employed by Burnaston for 24 years and the union coordinator of the United States, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never return.
A spokesperson for the government said they presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be resumed.
The White House stated that the high-risk meeting of Donald Trump and the undersecretary of justice Rosenstein could be delayed for another week because of the struggle by the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, links between Russian and Trump assistants, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
As long as Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General, and if he doesn't, which would endanger Mueller's independence, he fed the rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of disposing of the President through the 25th Amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, among reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he'd rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation into the FBI's allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
In response to the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied, "There's still no set date, it could be this week or it could be another week late, given all that's going on in the supreme court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press to be informed."
Some journalists questioned that statement, since Sanders has been running since September 10 without holding a press conference.
When host Chris Wallace asked why,
Sanders said that the lack of information sessions was not due to an aversion to the grandioseness of the reporters, although he added that it would not be her who denied that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president granted more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not cite any source that endorsed that data.
Informative meetings will continue, Sanders said, but he insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, that's much better than to direct the questions to it.
You are witnesses to how we've been doing this over the past few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignified visitors.
However, the press conferences alone are scarce.
Maybe the president showed the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions before the journalists assembled.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm the moods in Brexit
The Health Secretariat addressed a letter to EU workers in Scotland's NHS expressing the country's gratitude and communicating its desire to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish government has undertaken to cover the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in their decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on abandonment continued, and it is planned to reach the decisions this fall.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible non-agreement situation.
I know this is a period of anxiety for everyone.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The colleagues of the European Union and beyond provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us."
Christion Abercrombie under emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency surgery after a head injury during the defeat of Saturday (31/27) in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the Tennessee State trainer, informed journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he fainted when reaching the bandline.
The trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen on the bandline before taking him on a stretcher for further evaluation.
A technician from Tennessee State reported to Chris Harris, WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Similarly, he added that there are still no details of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year Red T-shirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tickets in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised his total of the season to 18th.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. This additional money will be used to help people without home under the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
Increase in bell tax will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help people without home
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help people without home.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on high-income people.
The increase in stamp tax will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money raised will serve to support the government's campaign to reduce the number of people who sleep in the street.
The charge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second dwellings and rental purchases, may be up to 3 %.
Fazenda hopes that the change will be able to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of new constructions in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a home for the first time have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "phantom cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson has applied for the application of a cut in the tax on the transmission of farms to help new people acquire their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping the prices of the high houses by buying the land and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenues on the moderate-priced houses to fix the "reproach of the housing sector" that is living in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of reform proposals relating to housing, including rent control and the ban on evictions in which the tenant is not guilty.
He also wants to grant municipalities greater powers when building new housing.
Mrs May said, "Last year I said I'd devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that, it's necessary to fix the disastrous housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it's not fair that it's as simple for those people who don't live in the United Kingdom as it is for foreign-based companies to buy housing as it is for British workers.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity that is supposed to have no roof continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to train Scotland."
The manager of Sunderland, Jack Ross, said that his "last ambition" is to become the Scottish electorate at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotch is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northwest club, which currently occupies the third square in the League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played in selection B once, and that was all," Ross said to BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when I was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will come only if I succeed in running a club."
Among Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's training position are Dick Advvocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of the Alloa Athletic states that he felt no anxiety over the success of these figures so consolidated in such a large club after he had previously rejected proposals from the Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me will depend at this moment on whether I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the club's structure and facilities are undoubtedly owned by a Premier League club," he said.
"It's not going to be a simple task to arrive, but it's likely that I'll only find success here if I can return the club to the Premier."
Ross has only spent three years as a coach after a period of assistant in Dumbarton and a 15-month period within the Hearts technical staff.
In that period he helped Alloa recover from the descent into the third division and managed to get St Mirren from being about to go down to win the title of the Championship the next season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I probably found myself in a real crossroads," he remembered, about taking care of the Alloa.
"I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange because it wasn't bad for me, I made a reasonably good living and enjoyed some successes.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot that you have to overcome every week.
I continue to suffer from the stress and pressure of work, but I like training.
I've always liked training and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."
You can listen to the full interview at Sportsound on Sunday, September 30 at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 (British summer time)
According to a survey, the perfect time to take a look is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on restaurants chains.
Pubs and bars grew by 2.7 percent during July, but consumption in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA trade council, responsible for compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's stay in the football world for longer than expected caused a pattern similar to that of June, in which pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, although restaurants suffered even greater punishment.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the turnover of restaurants during June has worsened during July.
The pubs and bars specialized in beverages were the ones that best achieved higher consumption than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Pubs specializing in meals also suffered the sun, although not as dramaticly as restaurant operators.
It's like people just want to go out and drink.
In controlled pubs and bars, drinking increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food decreased by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an employee of the RSM company for analysis of leisure and hospitality activities, said, "These results are a continuation of the trend that has been taking place since late April.
The time and impact of the main social and sports events continue to be the main factors related to consumption outside the home.
It's no surprise that groups of restaurants continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 percent a year will be especially painful if this is added to the continuous increase in costs.
The warm and long summer couldn't have come at a worse time for the restoration business and the time will be responsible for saying whether the moderation of the temperatures experienced during August will provide the much needed breathing for the sector."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The UK's Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator of pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with sets of over 9,000 million pounds and is considered the sector's reference point.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children (some of them only 11 years old) have secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers from a survey.
A survey conducted to 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "False Insta" pages
This news has caused an increase in fear of sexual content being published
Twenty percent of students said they had a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children (some of them just 11 years old) are creating accounts on social networks that keep adults secret.
A survey conducted to 20,000 high school students showed a growth in the number of "false institute" accounts (in reference to the social Instagram photo exchange network).
This news has caused an increase in fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a "principal" account softened to show their parents while they had other privates.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager who asked her to be raped.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said, "It's alarming that there are so many teenagers who are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the council of the Scottish athletic federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the council of the Scottish athletics federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a huge respect within the Scottish community, the UK and worldwide, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will greatly benefit from its incorporation into the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm very eager to speak to athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help run the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games, among a total of four Olympic golds and who currently works as the usual commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented him from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered from an apoplexy.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and until what degree.
It was exhausting work, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and I'm currently doing fast exercises.
Thank you for the encouraging messages
An announcement from a breast milk extractor compared to women with cows divides public opinion into networks
A company of breast milk extractors divided public opinion into networks with an announcement of how to compare suckling mothers with cows they're sucking on.
To announce the release of the proclaimed "world's first silent portable breast milk extractor", Elvie published an ironic ad in the style of a musical video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new breast milk extractor.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ugly for cows at the rhythm of a song with letters like, "Yes, I moved myself, but I don't have a tail" and, "If you don't notice, they're not open, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on, "Mux, mux, I'm feeding babies, mux, mux, I'm whispering my friends."
However, the announcement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy in the networks.
With 77,000 reproductions and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that this pos de manifesto the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very poor decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but in their case we steal their children days after giving birth," wrote one.
The Elvie milk extractor can place discreetly inside a mother's bra (Elvie/nai)
Another viewer commented: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why aren't they used to advertise a milk extractor for mothers staying with their babies?"
Another viewer added the following: "What an ad with so little tact."
Other spectators defended the announcement, even a woman said that the song seemed "very funny."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Taken out my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit silly, but I've interpreted it as a joke.
I think it's a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun announcement addressed to mothers that extract their milk (often in their workplaces or in bathrooms) and feel like cows."
This is not an advertisement to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their bras.
The concept on which the campaign is based is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, Elvie's milk extractor is completely silent, has neither cables nor tubes and can discreetly fit into a motherly bra, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even get out of there while they're extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, wife and creative executive director of Mother commented: "The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By describing the parallelism that exists between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges it implies while we demonstrated in a entertaining and close manner the incredible feeling of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time that the Elvie extractor occupies the headlines of the newspapers.
During London's Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures drifted on the gateway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children were quietly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively invariable, partly due to the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to assign patterns to the children.
Traditionally, most of the patrons were also immigrants without roles and were afraid of endangering their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential employers and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that this data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking U.S. Immigration and Customs Control Service, testified to the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who requested to sponsor minors without company.
Subsequently, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who are patrons or who are part of the home of these people are illegally found in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That's why we'll continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to prosecute the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require one of these to appear in court before a month has passed since their detention in place of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the workers of the shelter.
Many will appear via videoconferencing instead of personally trying to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer they stay in custody, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent robberies or escape attempts according to the shelter workers and system reports published over the past few months.
Lawyers have stated that these fears increase in larger centers like the Tornillo one, in which there is a greater possibility that the symptoms of a child having a hard time go unnoticed due to its size.
They also added that moving the children to the camp area without giving them enough time to prepare them from an emotional point of view or to say goodbye to friends might mean a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
The Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking to the UN General Assembly, also asked the Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were found on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of it in a timely manner".
"You must retire immediately and without conditions," he communicated to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also said that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem declared that the conditions for their return were given proper and blamed "some Western countries" for the "dissemination of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We use the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer aid for reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement reached between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel bastion of Idlib has allowed political discussions to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that the military actions would be targeted by the Shihadists, including the Al-Nusra front soldiers linked to Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
The UN envoy from Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to draw up an outline of a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem set out the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the body should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and alerted to possible interference.
Why Trump is going to win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would be able to re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency prematurely.
In what surely would be "The Dramatic End of a Presidency"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, the premium-time audience rates have multiplied by more than two, up to the 1.05 million viewers in the CNN and have nearly tripled to the 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time hours, an increase of 1.7 million compared to four years ago according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show" program led the channel audience indexes by cable with 3.5 million viewers during the nights when important news took place.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, showrunner of the drama for the ABC "Designed Survivor," which is about a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr Trump.
Why? He asked.
"He said, "Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
There's entertainment inside chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, the plots that are around Washington can determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
To disconnect from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
Still, it assumes something that goes beyond being an informed citizen spending six hours watching a panel of experts debate about Bob Woodward's use of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar ostrich blouse jacket ("a garment full of arrogance," Washington Pos said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' s scant descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario again the same way.
"Part of what it does makes it look like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night," commented Brent Montgomery, senior executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with the changes in characters and everyday turnings of Trump's show (the conflict with N.F.L., the compliments to Kim Jong-un...).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you'll stay behind.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, he was sunset and a temperature of 26 degrees out of the house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He wasn't able to hang himself while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court by hanging a thread.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows at the time and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money comes to lots to fund candidatures to the House for half-legislature elections
It's no surprise that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money because of the reorganization of a Congressional District with two career representatives to occupy the same position.
This district located outside Pittsburg which was recently reorganized is represented by the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, who obtained his post in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb presents himself against another representative in office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely superimposed on the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the Republicans would manipulate the electoral district of the old districts in their favor.
The electoral career in the new 17th Congressional District triggered a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Congress's Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after winning an adjusted victory in the March special election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed extensive follow-up.
That post was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won in the district for 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States valued the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support for China and then dropped behind.
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners threw it into the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to order to return to the chiefs of the U.S. diplomatic missions in O Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman in a statement made this month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately US$ 140 million of aid during 2017, was discussed, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, US and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in the efforts to avoid people's emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, important administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of applying sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to conduct the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance the administration attaches to him, the diplomats have said.
The three U.S. envoys discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for Mr. Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations whenever and when the participants remained anonymous.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst near the administration and who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was preserved.
Study history
The next negative case could be the report by special adviser Robert Mueller on the case of possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's justice, of which there is currently abundant evidence in the public archive.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller is also directing his research to discover whether Mr. Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will have to render accounts in that body, just when he has to prepare for the elections, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
They're a lot of strangers, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, as are his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to strike Hitler with a coup if the western front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of subsequent killings.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable progress of democracy is aggressing or backward.
Americans are facing several of these inflection points right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fire the Deputy Attorney General of the State, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein took the water to his neck since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording to the president and speculated that he was incapacitated for office.
Mr. Rosenstein has stated that the information from The Times is not true.
"How shall we respond if the investigation just requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or is not impartial or if its appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And above all, will we vote in the half-legislature elections for a Congress that demands Mr Trump's responsibilities?
If we don't pass those tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who also occupied my home, which was the knowledge of the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to arrest Shabat's candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans player is shown optimistic face-to-face against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receives Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive draw achieved in Spain against the Villareal this month, would place them in a very favorable position to rank in the Group G of the Europe League.
An injury on the knee prevented the camper Graham Dorrans from starting this season until the 2-2 tie in front of the Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use that result as a trampoline to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, since Villarreal is a good team," declared the 31-year-old player.
"We went into the game believing that we could get something positive and get a point.
We had the chance to win at the end, but, in general, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second we were superior.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to achieve the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last game, but with the support of our audience, I'm sure that we can fight to achieve a positive result.
Last year was tough between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that were made on the team, but there's an excellent environment right now.
The team is good, the boys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, to forget the past season and to succeed."
Women worry about saving their retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants were clear how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to their family about the matter.
Approximately half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide stated that they commented with their couples on the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want me to take care of her by a relative, but they're not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance department.
You can start with the next one.
You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't communicate your wishes to them in advance.
He collaborates with your advisor and your family to agree on where and how to receive care, since those decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Prolonged care funding options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever you have money.
He negotiates your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure the professionals meet your wishes in case you're not able to communicate.
He also appreciates the possibility of signing a notary power to manage your finances.
You'll have to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for yourself and make sure your bills are paid if you're disabled.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your father or older mother has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about her medications and allergies?
Please note in detail that this information is written in a plan to be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who care for it?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are you taking?
Who'll take care of the dog?
Set up a plan."
One man receives several shots with a compressed air rifle at Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a compressed air rifle as he walked home after nightfall.
The victim, about 40 years old, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was shot in the chest, in the abdomen and in the hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place at approximately 02:30 (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the aggressor.
His wounds are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to increase.
Due to the cut of communications, rescue bodies were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key data on Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Cèlebes, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that is located along more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
This regiment, an administrative region below a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy in the province of Central Célebes, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times during the last 100 years according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Donggala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia finds itself on the Pacific high-seismic fire belt, so it suffers from earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: An important earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, which took place on December 26, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226,000 people on the Indian coast, more than half of them, in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias in front of the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree magnitude earthquake struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree magnitude earthquake affected the Mentawai Islands, located opposite Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of people and caused the death of about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the regiment of Pidie Jaya, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
On this occasion, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the fall of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian island of Lombok, which caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily taken.
Arrest Sarah Palin's eldest son for accusations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for a crime of domestic violence, for preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and for resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with $500 bail, according to KTU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, of course" when asked, reported the chain.
Palin faces three minor crimes of type A, which means he could go to prison for up to a year and get a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor crime of type B, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Alaskan War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of preventing the filing of a complaint about domestic violence and the possession of drunk weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of poking a fist in his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder after serving with the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia results in hundreds of deaths
They count at least 384 dead after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-degree magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami to destroy thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the balance of the dead is expected to increase with the passing of days.
The earthquake occurred right in front of Central Celebes, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Iacarta.
Video circulates through the partner networks where the time of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on Palu's beach when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors try to apply a few times death penalty to the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
The federal prosecutors in New York are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack that has caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle lane on Lower Manhattan West Side Highway Avenue, following the life of pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused serious "intentionally" injuries to them, according to the notification of the intention of applying for the death penalty presented in the South District of New York.
Both offences imply the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented to Saipov an indictment of 22 crimes, including eight crimes of murder in collaboration with an organized crime group, usually used by tax officers of organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a "notable planning and premeditation," they declared the taxes by describing the way Saipov carried out the "hundred and cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaev Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," as indicated in the notice of intent of prosecution.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago, the South District of New York has not been prosecuting a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied to a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance during the days and months after the attack according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the videos of the ISIS he displayed on his phone according to the accusation.
He also asked to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He was found not guilty of the accusation of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal lawyers responsible for representing Saipov, indicated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction with life imprisonment without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
A Member of Parliament tory says that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in front of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize an army of people today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians had to "feel pressure" on Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the EU.
Regular Member Peter Bone said in front of the Birmingham demonstration that the United Kingdom would 'have already come out' of the EU if Mr Farage were Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile the divided ranks of her party was evident by joining the Tories in favour of staying in the EU to an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain the commitments of his chequer plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, the opposites and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labourers to choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the concentration of the Leave Means Leave movement in Solihull that he wanted to break the Chequers plan.
He suggested that you should have relied on Mr Farage to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been given the post, we would already be outside the EU at the moment," he said.
The Member of the Parliament of Wellingborough added the following: 'I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan'.
Showing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country".
Mr Bone denied the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and wanted to remain in the EU is completely false".
The member of the bullies and supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also went to march, from which he told the reporters: "All I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan does not enjoy popularity among public opinion, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Checkers Plan and start listening".
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises”.
Mr Farage said in the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians "feel uncomfortable" if they intend to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Today this is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit's decision and here we're meeting today to tell them we won't let them get away with it."
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit's decision, feel uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the army of people in this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU made a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour concentration in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners with Tories Against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered in an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a border without friction, to enjoy the free market without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
The concept of Brexit good doesn't exist," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously or introduce himself to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he'll seriously consider his candidacy for the presidency after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday during a municipal session in a town in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will be presenting himself for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It's focused on speculations that place it as Trump's successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the Town Hall format since Trump took on the presidency.
An assistant asked if she was planning to introduce herself to the president.
Warren said it's the time for "women to go to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and for that it takes a woman to the presidency."
Arrest related to the deadly shooting of Sims, the player of LSU
Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, LSU's basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson in a press conference at 11:00 (East time).
They've posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man who came out of the pictures.
Yes, 20-year-old, was shot near Southern University campus in the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head and finally died as a result of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed under custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 2 meter youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 headlines last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton comes to the world title thanks to team orders, which enabled him to win the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas classified himself in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would be decisive in the race.
Bottas, who was leaving from the pole, had a good way out and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into boxes first and let Hamilton run traffic in the back of the group, something that would be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in boxings some time later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced it after several wheeled maneuvers that caused Ferrari's driver to leave the inside unheatedly at risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver on the third curve.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and went up to the seventh square at the end of the first round on the day of his 21st anniversary.
Then he led the race during a large part of this thanks to which he retained his tires to get to go faster at the end and advance to Kimi Raikkonen by the fourth position.
He finally went into boxing in round 44 but couldn't advance any position on the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in the fourth square.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two squares," Hamilton said.
An Unsuitable Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in an act celebrated on Saturday by his insistence that he had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court of sexual abuse.
In a speech given in an act in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee and remarked instead that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "missible, repulsive and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful that is happening in the last days in the Senate, when you see indignation, when you see that people who are angry and miserable, repugnant and lying," he said.
"When you see these publications and leaks and they say, "Oh, I wasn't.
I wasn't."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you make any leaks?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document?: "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I wasn't.
Wait a minute.
Did we filter it?...No.", he added by imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent him the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I haven't hidden the charges of Dr. Ford, I haven't leaked his story," Feinstein told the committee as reported in The Hill newspaper.
'I ask you to keep your privacy and I did what you asked me to do'.
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented the following during the Saturday evening act: "I tell you that body language was not the right one.
He may not have filtered it, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and disgusting, they don't care who they hurt, they have to run over to regain power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat suffered on Friday at the Elite League against the Belfast Giants winning the game back for 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early advantage with two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied up for the local set before Dwyer restored the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard tied to Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third defeat in the elite league of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to rise up to win the Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, with the balance of the three wins before the Giants.
The initial goal of Dwyer was at 3:35 a.m. thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assistance.
In an initial period of agitation, Sullivan put the local team back into the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to mark the draw goal at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants advance the marker before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team was regrouped and Bouchard re-matched the match with a goal with power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen advance the Dundee for the first time in the match at the end of the second period and secured the victory through the fifth goal of his team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will play at home in Milton Keynes their next game, which will be held on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers from an aircraft can escape an earthquake
An air controller from Indonesia considered a hero after dying to ensure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The balance of dead people is 800 and there are many missing after a major earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and there are many people trapped under the cliffs of the city of Palu.
Although his fellow workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan General refused to leave his post at the control tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri de Palu that shook violently.
He stayed in his post to make sure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the runway at that time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to fall.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Siriat said that this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported the ABC News channel in Australia.
We set up a Balykpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Let our hearts be broken when we hear it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death balance may be thousands and the country's disaster management agency has stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance of victims is believed to continue to increase because there are many bodies under the debris and many of them could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are transporting help and live.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing in bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting the minimers».
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross Indonesia is fighting to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" he informed CNN.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a missing person after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that there's a missing one before stating that the 47 passengers and crew had left without incident the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline reported that it was working with the authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to more detailed requests for information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Ships in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crash against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events continue to be unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed by the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American national passenger, commented that he entered very little height.
"That's something extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers managed to advance between the water that reached their waists to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also remembered that the flight attendants were screaming and scared, and that he suffered a slight wound in the head.
The U.S. Navy indicated that some sailors who were working near the site on the improvement tasks of a dock also helped the rescue by using an inflatable boat to move people to the coast before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The D.A. returned to trial on Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the cell phone records to recapture the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19th victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett stated that he had received data from the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was meeting with Chambers the night of his death contradicting his earlier claims as reported in The Clarion Ledger.
When this data showed that his mobile phone was meeting with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the stage on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when she declared she was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said she was "lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction consisted of Tellis claiming to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The mobile phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett declared that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis removed the messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"Borrouna of your life," said Hale.
It's scheduled for the defense to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would be brought to trial by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A trio of hip hop wants to challenge the negative perception that has the genre by filling your music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, states that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and a struggle against social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get the combative hip hop back popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common recently experienced a rejuvenation in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another nigger?!
A New York child nurse demands a couple after a "racist" message
A child nurse in New York will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that she would not have addressed to her from the mother in which she complained that she was "another black".
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the demand with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her anguish to discover that the babysitter Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"Nooooooooon, another black," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, stating that the nurse who had just left, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and expected an Filipino according to the announcement from the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid on the day of work and sent home in a Uber.
Now Maurice is going to sue the couple for compensation for the dismissal and requires compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for which they were initially hired even though there was no average contract.
"Look, I want to show you that these things aren't done," he said to the Post on Friday, to then add "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by claiming that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, for they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after being offended.
"My wife had sent him a message she didn't intend to send him.
He's not racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco declared at the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offended, even if it had been due to a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on!"
After comparing the lawsuit with "extortion," Plasco said that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are they going to get a person like that?
That's not very ethical," added the investment banker.
As the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them by their behavior and the applied logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear as they could conclude in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to get on the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's really fun to know now what we know about Paddington's huge success."
After stating that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a little toy bear, would be optimistic about his refusal to work, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agridious" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to whom he describes as a "very important member of our family," he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a silent man and nothing presumptuous," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who got something: you're proud even if you didn't really do it.
I think I felt Paddington's success a little that way.
Even though it was a creation of his own and a product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye through the phone.
After the landing, his daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked unsuccessfully to save his life.
"There was no regular call to say that it was very bad, that it was not expected to survive.
"Then I received Nad's call to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly consuming and abandoning his body.
He had already died a while before, and now he was shutting down.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to take it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapered, at that time of mourning for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without noticing the ordeal she was suffering.
"No one has detected him," he said.
"He had a low head and tears fell on me at all times.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this awesome feeling of solidarity with Nad.
That I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Posters from afflicted women to avoid suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to which you can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any father to feel like I have to feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis living in Lydney commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said their smile lit any room."
However, he left the job before he died and was "in a very deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis commented, "I am concerned that there is a collateral effect."
Mrs. Davis has created the cards to inform people that there are people to talk to and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don't be silent, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He did not comment that he was sad or depressed or anything like it," he remarked.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day played the background (when the children opened their presents, he made no visual contact with them or nothing)."
He said that his death was a tremendous trauma to them, but they must overcome him: "He broke up the family.
He threw us out.
But we have to keep going and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs from a thread while the FBI starts the investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what we were asking for (a limited time research and limited scope), we might get a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "snapping" because of the paralyzing of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
Their reluctance is due to a matter of deadlines.
Five weeks left for half-legislature elections (November 6). If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to which, he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently employs 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea falls under Kim's mandate
The number of deserters in North Korea to South Korea has been reduced from Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's Ministry of Unification, said 1,127 desertions occurred last year, far from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in fees charged by people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
The vast majority of deserters in the North are finally offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, which has the largest trettle border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China sees deserters as illegal emigrants instead of refugees and frequently repatriate them.
The relationship between the north and the south (which are technically still at war) has improved markedly over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries gathered in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This took place after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un held in Singapore, where they agreed to work very hard to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress since then.
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we can't trust our national security, and in those circumstances, there's no possibility that we should unilaterally disarm ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered in front of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims it's inappropriate to access the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the "historical" Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court and assured him that he was not appropriate by his nature for access to the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Austin Festival on Saturday, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman were ever to behave like that, they would call her hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, on occasion almost screaming and standing out talking while describing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats of the committee, cataloging the charges against him as a "murder of the grotesque and coordinated reputation" organized by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential elections.
So he declared that he believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because he showed that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
So he objected when he was asked whether he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if it's confirmed at the post and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not right to be in the Supreme Court alone, but in the court you're currently in," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit Court.
So he added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible resolutions that he could adopt Kavanaugh against the law of protection to the patient and care of accessible health or the Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In view of the confirmation, Kavanaugh left questions as to whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be annulled.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the court and still wait for us to say, look how well!" said Pelosi.
And women need to exercise it.
It's justifiably on top, months and years of rage overflowing, and it can't be thrown out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, do I?"
He continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said she was also crying when she got angry, but who developed a technique that was that, when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You're probably thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then he went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my sharpest memories in one of my first jobs in an office dominated by men, in which I began to cry with an impossible anger to describe, was that an older woman grabbed me from the back of my neck, a distant superior who had always provoked me a slight fear, and led me to the corner of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you if they come to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on an out-of-married adventure on a boat named Monkey Business and was withdrawn from the presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why he could not consider presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," I told myself in laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it "Brancaneves and the seven dwarfs."
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in raising funds, so he swore he wouldn't go into the presidential race unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of her supporters contributed $1,000 to the male candidates would only provide $250.
"What do you think, that I have a discount?" she wondered.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by the emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported him, of frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address the voters instead of the delegates and angered by the existing sexism) that remained speechless.
"You'd think I'd suffered a nervous crisis," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my tombstone?
"Did you cry?"
How trade war between the United States and China can be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the US-China trade war were deafening and, although the war is far from over, a distance between the countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning early this year by recording key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with the application of new tariffs that affect an equivalent of $200 billion, recording half of the articles coming from China to the United States.
Beijing has countered the same attack, the most recent rising tariffs from five to ten percent in $60,000 million in American products.
China has promised to imitate the American measures and it seems unlikely that the world's second largest economy will change in the short term.
To get Washington to move back, it would be necessary to give in to its demands, but to bow publicly to the United States would be far more shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its letters correctly, the pressures of trade war with the United States could favour China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the necessary conditions for starting an economic crisis in both countries is actually far more dangerous than was previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, an Asian-centered researcher at the Center for New American Security, a study center.
Syria is "list" for the refugees to return, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims it's ready for the voluntary return of the refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now all the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of the refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods are already given.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people are still living in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional help from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the US team by a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It's the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States on European territory and it's won without a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to hit the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battle he had during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in the hole 16 pair 3, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has shined in all his series, becoming one of the only four players who've achieved a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was implemented in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the player with the worst ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The first ranking in the world's ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups played, Spanish Sergio García became the European player with more tournament wins, with 25.5 points.
"I don't often cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a hard year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get my drink back.
The important thing is the team, and I'm glad I could have helped," declared a excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the witness to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat the American legend of Tiger Woods golf by 2&1 in the individual game of Sunday.
"It's amazing how proud I am today to be able to defeat Tiger Woods. I grew up to watch that boy play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record at the Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistic for one of the top players of all time, the winner of 14 majors, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems all weekend not to get out of the streets, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-caliber golf during the whole tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance, "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning for a moment they put the Europeans in trouble.
We fought.
I'll take my hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganise, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's to pull out the hat.
They were superior."
