What's going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor any pastry in Prague.
The new CSSD electors in the capital city will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand at the municipal council level with their former and new colleagues in the OSD.
The newspaper Actuale.cz "tested" to the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they knew the argot that was born in the last few years at the city hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition who were leading to Prague.
The codified vocabulary that Prague's political cream started in the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been discovered that new electors do not understand very well the known terms.
At least they say so.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a young man in pragois politics reacted to Lukas Kaucky, who was elected to culture as a test of the word of the "bride".
And with regard to the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf tunnel".
"It's the only expression you're proposing me to use"
Otherwise, I don't use the mortar.
From the vocabulary, whose current newspaper.cz published the expressions in June of this year prior to the ODS' pre-Ectoral Congress, the editor chose 6 examples, first of all those that are related to Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", go to the bakery", "nerf de bueuf", "treason de la capital" and "entol√≥ler".
Three of the elected members agreed for the quiz, the fourth-Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek basically refused the test.
"I don't care at all about these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with the way we will understand ourselves in our programs," he responded.
As has already been heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not seem to recognize in the above legend, that it is the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kaucky and the only expression he came up with in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky said and immediately added, "but I know about the newspapers."
"I'm gonna have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
Not only the slaughterhouse Karel Brezina but also Lukas Imagination, the elected for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two social democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Imaginey knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of "going to the pastry".
"It's, I think, going into a business," Imagination is ready to guess that it's the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
On the same your Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge from the newspapers rather than from any vocabulary he would use.
According to test candidates, there is no lexicon of argument in social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues and it seems we really don't have anything like that."
"The names are said to be sometimes used with abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, who the members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that, Commissioner Karel Brezina about the nicknames.
The newspaper Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for Party members or even the least friendly Little old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the election by the scams during the party's sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones that allow social democrats to work within the party.
It seems Hulinsky doesn't like to hear Hulda much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this pragois president.
"Doctor en droit de matraque" said that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title as doctor in law JUDr. at the bratislava police academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "sorcers", has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They are rather part of the old generation, they cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "sister" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man has very rarely this destiny."
"We also don't judge healthy young women because they participate in the work and give birth to children," said a sister in the capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of over 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual social measure.
He has published a brochure that should help to limit the witch hunt.
The case has a "hic".
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the daily Die Standard warned about the inconvenience of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had sprinkled on her.
This information was transmitted by the BBC server.
Criminals claim it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointings has ignited the contact of the woman.
Oil burned, it seemed, when the team wanted to "seek out the evil spirit" of the woman.
Isolation of "stores" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human-spirited eaters have always represented a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce witch hunting, the Gambia did not even see the President himself participating last year.
"Gambien President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, has launched a broad hunt for witches who, he seems, would have participated in his death and worked by black magic to kill the President as well."
"Nearly Guinean shamans came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kamalim, under the protection of police and the personal custody of the President, men and women randomly chosen in the villages of Gambia," said the organization "Amnesty International.
On the farm, people in prison had to drink a potion of plants based on halolucinogenic effects, which also caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
On international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The leathers warm, he has signed a higher rent.
An elderly man who was imposing came out of the door of the customer centre of the company RPG Byty of the "carbon baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new leases for three apartments: his own, his daughter's and his son's who is trained to serve a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to settle from next year for an apartment 2+1 of second category 4100 kroner.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works on solid fuel," points out the finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed it anyway" explains t he moved in anger and half re-signed.
The Citizens' Association of BytyOKD.cz Apartments that described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a leaflet will be published to explain the method to claim.
But man reacts to it by a gesture of hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" by frowning the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the deregulatory laboratory.
After the New Year, this is what is expected of most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava area and is already full on Tuesday at 09 a.m.
Just next to the door is a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
A single pressure and a paper with a number coming out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number is already starting to light up on the large screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to learn about the rent, but the new rents don't seem to affect people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to resolve common problems as everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people of more than 44,000 apartments in the GDP portfolio receive mail with the new leases in their letterbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
the special window for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been running for almost a week, so it's still under trial," she responds, after a moment of hesitation, to the employee behind the window when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and former Bakal minor apartments are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of Parliament and from the Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek region of the Social Democrats reported on it in a fairly sustained manner prior to the elections and now fills in local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change me a putt...n board in the toilets, he relieved himself in the introduction of the man mentioned.
However, they are above all, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a return on the new rent price if they now sign as they promised RPG in a special offer.
It is a half-retour of the rent that will be received by the other tenants who have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is not really overwhelmed by questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," the employee said.
And yet RPG puts it both on its website and in the windows of individual rent interviews when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on rent, the decision will be taken by an independent court.
'It is not threats but only to inform about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,' says RPG on its website.
"No one will go to court" thinks one of RPG Byy's employees and the man in the street in front of the client centre gives him a reason.
"I have 13,000 retiring crowns and I have 5,000 krone left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee feels suddenly uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore the people wait," she says.
The regulation of rents ends in the Czech Republic in early 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, in addition, current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, which is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this is expected to make 5.2 billion.
The large screen attached to the ceiling in front of the padded chairs of the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and concerns no less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments'.
"And it will always be at more than 7.50 Czech krones the m2 per month," says the screen.
The increase of 38 percent concerns only 400 apartments in the GDP portfolio.
"In these cases, it is an increase of a really very low amount 19.66 Czech kroners to the m2", says RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on increasing rent have priority.
The mother's school is also part of offices that included architects.
the Avriopoint administrative building of Brno is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini kindergarten with all it takes - walls of colors, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch. design employees can go there.
The Arch. Design architectural project company, whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini-home business school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially children's age, and it was important for women architects and project managers to be able to get back to work quickly.
At the same time as shorter employment contracts, the kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Manufacturers and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work with care for children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who imagined this kindergarten and with the support of management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-maternal school is funded through the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
With funding facilities (with 2.8 thousand Czech crowns), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years to ensure qualified staff and start-up.
After the use of the funding allocation (two years) the company Arch. Design. has an obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it was the Economy rating company that helped make the application for staffing.
Care for children is provided by qualified staff, a nurse and a nurse throughout the day take care of children. Children can go to kindergarten without age restrictions, but they have more than three years for most.
As this is a "minimum mother's school" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more children who replace each other.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without looking at the hierarchical position.
Although it is individual care and education, the mini-maternal school program is comparable to that for pre-school education.
It is not only for children to play, but also for quality education - from beginning to preparation for school benches English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys and imaginative games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their children and do not have the stress of delay to go to a school away from the parent's workplace.
Parents use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s's is thus listed among companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and are friendly to the family and through this program reinforces HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look inside Gaudi.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric sarien, the staircase to a spine of dinosaur and balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house received from the premises the nickname House in bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present of curves, here is all that is typical for the Art New of Antoni Gaudi.
The front fa√ßade of the house runs its dream lines, its pleasing colors and textures that remind the nature and the animals.
In a more detailed observation, we see geometry, rhythm and order thought with precision.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit so that the impression of brightness of the colors is strengthened.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood vaguely copies the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the oeilleton and the blades.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample neighborhood in Passeig de Gracia street in number. 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first stressed the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another completely new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of unusual and better market reconstruction.
But Casa Battlo's idea as a multiple-bedroom house was not thought by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade were born.
Other artists and creators also worked for the facade.
The joint work for the plans of Casa Battlo began with successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises nicknamed the house hot just after its completion because of its organic forms "the House in Bones".
Others, in view of the specific mechanism of opening the windows have called it "the house that dances".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of construction contain hidden religious motives.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with air events and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems strange.
During the creation of Gaudi absolutely failed to comply with the then construction directives and did not allow themselves to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the permit to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after the completion the municipal council was horrified and asked for modifications.
He did not like, for example, the members of the municipal council that the pillars of the construction impinge on the public pavement.
There was never a change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and got satisfaction) for permission to rent the two top floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third there was a room and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented at a jewelry store.
The entire house of six floors is shared by a staircase by which you reach up to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of binding spaces.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the salons and the high society can communicate comfortably or be limited to private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has also received new facades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with light wells.
The two-coloured game gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that the white reflects more than the dark that instead absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house, which was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund, may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and beautiful apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued their visits because they found it to be a lucrative business and expanded the scope of visits to common spaces and to the barn, including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other constructions of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you must quickly find a friend among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and an upholstery: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatory frame, but rather the quality of the area reserved for the bed, so the mattress and the top give a real basis for a good bed.
Of course they must complement each other harmoniously to please a specific user.
During the selection several things are decisive: weight, size, age, health status, and the owner's sex.
The type of interior in which the mattress and top are to be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the country house where the latex mattresses are not continuously asleep are not suitable because they are "heated" slowly.
In addition, they have higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in their heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. The mould can also be formed there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
Anyone who spends the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a softening layer will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"This is how all hockeyists who come back from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a tumbling layer of lazy foam."
"These mattresses are also recommended for people suffering from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that thus poorly assumes "the information" of the joints and skin," Sylva Adamczikova explains who specializes in the furniture backed up.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered hockeyists and other customers.
"Today everything goes well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also Czech Tropico have for example suitable mattresses.
You don't need to be a guy from NHL in order to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
There is no pressure on you and you will not return in the night as after a difficult game.
You just sleep better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against squares.
To choose the mattress according to your size, add the length of your feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and woman with a size of 180cm need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or in all 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 / 140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should lay your hands comfortably with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Butchers and Decorators, which has been devoted for several years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and teaching in specialized schools.
For a double bed each needs its own top and mattresses, so be careful, however, while choosing the height of the mattress well.
Otherwise you will only be left to climb the top at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Mousse mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which are for the shape and aeration layer at least three centimeters.
"In touch or in position sitting on the mattress you must not feel the springs," warns H√©l√©na Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-determined type of top.
The sleeping bed, when the mattress and the sommier are united like the somois sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; we mustn't wash it, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night one normally sweats from 0.2 to 0.75 l it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to remember a large (and bottled) tamis.
For this reason, specialists refuse to make a 25-year-old claim for a mattress or life warranty.
But everything to his mind.
And for that to be an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing, but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if today it is common to manufacture coatings with sliding closure for the whole, that is to say that after opening we have two parts (for washing and washing machine size it is very important!) otherwise handling for large models (and for one person) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a top?
Never!
Not more than one guest bed for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are no airholes) and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with springs in bags (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an air cover.
A polyurethane mattress must not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position blade tops with 14/18 blades, the latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more blades, 28 and above, where the blades are folded in the lower part of the kidneys and thus it is possible to regulate their rigidity.
For multi-position mattresses it is not necessary to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to changes in position.
Next to the rigidity adjustment of the blades you can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
This is a special link of the blades that allows pressure or even tilt the blade so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back" is really an important thing.
This is already envisaged by the manufacturers of mattresses that for the "male" have started using a softening zone at the shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they offer them a softer surface at the hip level again.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or platelet tops with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and diinates the tension.
But of course, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated with air) on good mattresses and napkin, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its points must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians per example prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow must upgrade (with the backrest of the backrest or the rammollie area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first straw and grass-based mattresses.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also to bio mattresses.
Oil-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soy oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybean.
"The Bio qualifier for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop perfumes from the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of bulwark plants so that the coating of the mattress absorbs the heat and cools the body, "refroid" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for low sex.
The current favourites?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a cell structure disturbed more breathable than the standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffness of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, bottom of the back and feet is located.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached first place.
Saving for mattress and top is not simple.
From time to time, we can have in the framework of special shares on the part of manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
Like the company Magniflex that offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second for free.
The age of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the Tempur material at a "cosmic" rate.
This began as a matter for NASA because astronauts were experiencing the start-up of huge load factors.
The Tempur softens to the heat and hardens, on the contrary, to the cold.
It therefore perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against sleeplessness and for an increase of comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that relieve the legs and venous system.
Czech manufacturers use e.g. EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
The monitoring devices are increasingly being requested by parents who wish to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can as well be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases as for example that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a box of matches but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of the little Annicka has prompted a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," said Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting them in a person's bag who is not aware of it, but I haven't met such cases yet."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons," said Pilin.
He said children should always know for what purposes the "box" is used and how to use it in the event of an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws the attention that if the child does not want to wear something like this, he will get rid of it.
'Even younger ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something deliberately when they don't want to be under control.'
"The mobile phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already led the parents to long expectations," Bockova says.
In her view, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is highly questionable.
"If this is a rapture prepared, the author will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate it."
"Now it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She confesses that such devices can help when an attack is not prepared by a pedophile.
According to RC Monitoring company Robert Cech, who offers tracking services for both cars and people, says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an attack.
"The apparatus may be parameterized in such a way that it is on a regular emission after a specified period."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains anyway."
'Cheapest devices also have a tiltometer that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and is in a lying position without moving," Cech says.
According to him, smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special prological.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is a device similar to that carried in pendant of the size of a box of matches or the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are being conducted to make devices similar to common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the possible attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he'll figure it out after a while, which has given the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to plot cars.
This is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cords that it could tour the Czech Republic with, but it can only hold two years.
The army bought for 445 km of cords used for explosives.
Since last year, the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 km.
The army therefore has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of the cords is up to two to four years.
The army bought detonating strings from the anonymous STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave the reason for the award of a huge amount of DNES-Detoning Strings that soldiers use 60 km per year.
Depending on the reserve calculations to be made by military pyrotechnics, which MF DNES contacted, it is clear that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household personnel should have an explosive exercise every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the military's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the military reserves could sustain it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it is true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is sufficient for more than 2 m of detonating cords, as the experts say, that means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - the reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the troops of the rapid response brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no ammunition for their fist weapons and that shooting sessions were limited due to the need for money.
We're not talking about the lack of linen.
"And I don't get my head if they buy so many detonating cords at home."
"And that's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good customer that we strive as content traders," said STV Group Manager Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of miles of detonating cords have been purchased by the army to have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group reports only four years of life of detonating cords and pyrotechnicians of the police and the army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the warehouses, it can even go up to four years," said one who does not want his name to be published in the light of the army's criticism.
The period of life passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the soldier's life.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other department argument is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's 245 km supply," says the spokesperson Pejsek, who interprets the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cords of police pyrotechnicians that neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police always control only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for reasons of pyrotechnics safety and to be able to obtain more flexible types of more modern and more reliable detonating cords.
The Ministry of Defence today has major problems in neutralizing tens of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, head over the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometres of old detonating cords that it buys today "at cheap".
Until now I have benefited from contacts I have received through the competitions.
The free sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the competition of the best individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition of the best Individual Entrepreneur for last year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberia there was a lack of a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and the price of accommodation in our region has given me the desire to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
It reinvests the profit in the building that it transforms into a pension with 54 beds.
Since that time, his acting as a contractor has allowed him to open in Liberiac 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
Another of the same quality came to him this year.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates for the franchise of Pytloun hotels," the number 1 of entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the implementation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the competition of the contractor of the year served well, adds Pytloun with recognition.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known to Liberiac and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses his contacts and knowledge to this day that he could not have obtained otherwise.
"With those I met through the competition I began to maintain business relations regularly.
According to him, success-related reputation has also had an impact on employees.
And it's about 70.
"I observe in their homes above all the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that has been generally recognized."
"It is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," says Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was rapidly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner Farmet at the worst moments behind himself.
The one who came to search for the price at Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it turned a toolshop at Ceska Skalice into a 100 million kroner turnover firm.
'I can say that the reward has encouraged not only me and my collaborators and has increased our self-confidence in combating competition', said the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet society there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after confiscation of property by communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a company where he was working at the time, and created a company with a few comrades around his father for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they started specializing in vegetable oil presses.
He became after eighteen years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the unspecialized public after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
"Not only have our customers started to really get to know the Farmet brand, but also the foreign partners who have started to realize that they were collaborating with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not pass to Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the economic results of 2008 and part of 2009.
And in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect the citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We have not, of course, escaped from this situation."
"The turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even quit," says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and retained beneficial results even if they were lower than those they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We have built a training and research centre with the endowments, strengthened the company's presentation in international trade fairs and won the main awards in national exhibitions," Zdarsky said.
Everything leaves us thinking that the crisis is behind them.
The figures of claims also increase and with them the number of employees.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that suppresses foolish regulations.
The survey on the Absurity of the year is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be deleted.
This year's low-gloss winner of the Absurity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring documents to the offices that officials can obtain online.
More than one third of the 4,000 voters voted for this.
For example, the social affairs administrations requested a paper extract from the trade register while the grievor can obtain it in two clicks of mice.
It changes because of the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the Trade Register for Insurance Payments Controls," said Jana Buranova, spokesperson for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Point out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must complete in the Czech Republic and remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this Absurdity competition of the year.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If 3,000 voters showed up last year, at least 4,000 this year gave their vote.
And it's not surprising, there are the most diverse legal obligations in our country that only slow down the business, and, more and more.
"We may be the number of documents to be completed for tax returns in first place in the world," said Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity becomes a stated goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is 74th in terms of the conditions for the company, 8 more places than last year.
The Absurity of the Year competition was first set up in 2006 and continues every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone who can report every year the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities of April at the end of September, the last time before the closing of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaruku.cz. Next, the contest organizer selects seven candidates for "anti-price" and lets the public vote during October on the website www.firmaruku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that has received the highest number of votes is declared to be the winner.
Up to the last survey last year, it's a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and credits that have lost their sense of existence.
Comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also by professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, there is a requirement that highway maintenance vehicles and fast roads pay for tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees recapture two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which starts in early November at the Place Wenceslas in Prague, is part of a trapping in which members of political and public life participate regularly.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts heels in the legs of entrepreneurs, and for this my goal is to delete, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs which today only complicate the company," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decrets is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what was not pleasing to people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days before to the office for the individual company where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Business Act.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to declare to the Labour Office a service trip for a foreign employee over 30 days, was deleted with the Act on what is called the Green Card.
And everything is okay until the third session of the competition.
The 2009 Absurdity was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the 2010 Responsible Firm.
The objective of this competition is to support the firm's reasonable and fair.
"We want to support companies that monitor their company's environmental impacts and conduct a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, the Vodaphone company, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the 2010 firm's competition organized by Vodaphone company, companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term goal for the company have registered.
The adventure of each of them is full of inspiration and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the object of their business is different from one another, their support and forecast activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
For one of these cases, this applies to persons with disabilities and to the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the entire Czech Republic is not the Pagoise Prological Society and Netera that supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor to the staffing fund for children with disabilities for 17 years.
In taking care of employees with health problems, we can also mention the old paper manufacturing plant in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 percent of them and, for this purpose, has obtained the title of the company Responsible for the Central Bohemian Region and which has placed itself third in the region in the competition of the firm of the year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who has won for introducing flexible working hours and even decreases up to 35 hours per week on average and, without proportionally, reduction in wages.
The jury also honoured the title because it gives priority to Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoyenous activity in the surrounding area and concerns the environment.
"We are striving to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and administration have the least environmental impact," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of the company.
IT Responsible Company Enlogit de l'Region de Usti also considers the health of its employees and set them up for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses catering services from a local protected plant for its actions.
"We also support the foundation Man in the shadow that helps the local Roma community," says Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
At the top of the list, also for its activities, there is a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased qualifications and leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the construction society of bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravie-Silesia region.
They were automatically registered in the Corporate Responsible category, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone Year Firm competition, which had responded to the attached questionnaires of the registration document and referred it to the organizer before August 15.
The incomplete or incomplete responses in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in law had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm Responsible but were not disqualified from the "principal" competition the Vodaphone Year Firm."
"Independent registrations are not possible because this is a subcategory of the main competition of the Year's Firm," says Karel Goldman of the Bison&Rose Organizing Agency.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police arrested during a public competition
In the Plzen Land Fund building, the anti-corruption police have undergone arrests in recent days.
The detectives passed handcuffs to the local contractor and trading in Lubos real estate. G.
The applicant had endeavoured to precisely manipulate a public tender for the settlement of an application for restitution in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a given candidate.
He was supposed to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police pursue a person for an initiation offence in the context of a call for tenders and a public contest." said Pravo the head of Plzen's Prosecutor's Office Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is prohibited to provide more explanations as the investigation is under way.
After 24 hours, the police released this 46-year-old contractor.
In order to determine how it could influence a public competition, it can only be speculated in the light of so little official information.
On a matter of Pravo, the spokesperson for the Lubomira Cerna Lands Fund indicated that police officers had actually arrested Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a client and in no case an employee," she said.
The Public Competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call to propose rights to transfer land under the Land Act" and is established when several eligible applicants are manifest.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their right to restitution which must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a classification of buyers is in place and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the spokesperson of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, information concerning persons who had registered in the appeal and as he himself, also, a beneficiary since having purchased a large number of refund rights, he had proposed to field candidates not to participate in the competition.
And he was probably in the process of withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interrogation.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the standards at the FdT (Land Fund).
It was in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for editing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been issued.
Justifiably Lubos G. had obtained land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and place where access to the Borske Pole industrial area was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the mayor for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The mayor was forced to accept because otherwise it would risk putting the construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay a supplement of about 100 crowns per month for housing.
Households will have to pay a supplement from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
From January onwards, families will have to pull up to a hundred crowns a month longer than they are now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, the gas of almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to one tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to bring the 100 crowns annually to the apartment for households more than at present.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices given the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course when people need it most to heat and thus have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count about a hundred crowns in addition.
While electricity and gas increase throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
They are mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 additional krona per month, families in Liberiac will pay more than 1000 krona annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague, an increase of 9 per cent for water and sanitation is being prepared in the event that the city increases the rents of infrastructure.
If rents do not change the plows will pay a supplement of 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be part of the lowest compared to the whole country.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will increase, for example, significantly in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January onwards, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by the company.
Regular rents that people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk with rum and fernet. The beer is no longer fashionable and it works very slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whiskey are stolen from parents.
They are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for recidivism do not make the exception.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions of hospital children's departments.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be healthy."
'The trend is really strong alcohols,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of Children's Department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a bottle to Dad in the closet, it's sometimes whiskey but it's fernet and vodka that prevails."
"Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so don't feel it," says the Head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for Motol Hospital, also gives her reason.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"Today is alcohol in fashion especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was a slivovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the Head of Department of P√©likan, seeing drunk children aged 13 to 14 in hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he spent ten years precisely in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from around completely drunk broads.
"A young girl was hospitalized like this four times
"She began her career at 12 years of age when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in her blood with a mixture of ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it didn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter was missing 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinterest of parents or their unusual tolerance in the face of their rejection of drinking that is the main cause of the development of child alcoholism.
According to experts, however, there is no mention of addiction, in its strict sense, for children.
"Under the terms of alcohol, a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena resulting therefrom but not found in children."
"In those who use repeated alcohol, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background," said the Head of the Department of P√©likan.
According to the Spokesperson Jurinova, approximately 40 drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with an intoxication strike requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
The drunk children who are after emergency care brought home by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, he excites according to P√©likan three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of witches, the Saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
" Either they drink by spite after bad results or they celebrate the start of the holiday."
"Of course I've lived on the day of the witches an admission of 7 drunk children at once," said P√©likan.
The drunk child who spent the night at the hospital in detoxification under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who came home and suffered the next day from the "woodhole".
The morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by a glucose infusion and nutrients required by the body.
"They are for this better batches because they spend an excellent evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only amazed at where they are," adds Pelikan, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transportation and hospitalization on intensive care beds can reach tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I have applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their brittleness has cost and that they could spend all summer in seasonal work to repay one evening," P√©likan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regression managements, which should recover from parents the expenses related to care, do not deal with cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 of the five aircraft in total, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off Tuesday to Seville in Spain, where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer is located.
This is the first time that such devices have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they were abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that have so far been in service in the Czech army and were in flight condition.
The remaining three devices are single-place versions of the L-159.
They are currently stationed at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the company Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody planes is currently unknown.
'The L-159 single-seater aircraft planned for the exchange were caught on long-storied aircraft without causing additional charges or investment for the Ministry of Defence."
"The L-159 T1 biplaces have been exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He argued that the army would not be left out of office as the ministry signed an agreement in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody of 200 million crowns for the transformation of four L-159 single-seaters unused into two two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, he committed to introducing aircraft into equipment in some Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly indicated that the one who takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and will serve as the training of NATO pilots."
"It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa plane and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not launched an invitation to tender and has contacted EADS directly.
the defence management argued that the exchange ensures a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army purchased 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and used only 24, which wanted to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes will probably have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected in a European tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one should arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annular is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the annular are exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the startling conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple risk test for prostate cancer, especially for men over 60 years of age," proclaimed the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including by combining genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain over 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index of the right hand shorter than the annular.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the longer index than the annual risk, however, there was a 33 per cent decrease in risk for men before 60 years of age, the decrease in risk reached 87 per cent.
The length ratio of the two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, inter alia, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that testosterone is precisely what helps the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former President of the Academy of Sciences, said for CTK that he is aware of this study but it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer is "fully demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Czech Republic as most of Europe is this morning covered by snow.
On roads and sidewalks, most of the time of compact snow, the breakers worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between 89th and 93rd km towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno heading to Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Central Motor Club (UAMK) told the information
At the 91st km a truck was injured, at the 93rd two heavy weights occurred, the accident injured.
Several cars also found themselves in the ditch.
The problems are also on Highway D1 to 185 km towards Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at 190th km or go through Brno and then enter 182nd km to Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers formed in this place.
Also on Highway D11, there is an accident and, just upon arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car rows are created for example in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
The trams are delayed, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and the Place de la Peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the state of crisis in Prague has yet to meet.
Railways and the airport also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to be removed due to snow 7 quick connections.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. in the night until 5 a.m. in the morning.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but doubling vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impracticable, on the road to Brno it begins to be there by places of snow gusts and on the road to Blansko the chains are required to pass certain channels of communication in the places above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
Until now the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratic-Milesovice
To clean them, we may need to send snowflakes and strawberries.
We cannot for the moment estimate when they will be rollable.
On the road to Hodonin, caution is strict in the White Carpathian region.
On the roads that are, given the protection of nature, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow alert CTK.
In Chechnya, it fell between two and 10 centimeters of snow; it fell the most in North Bohemia, with often up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravie-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snow was gradually disappearing in Czech Republic.
The Americans have a new "intelligent weapon"
The U.S. Army has sent to Afghanistan a new "intelligent" weapon, known only as code XM-25.
The generals think that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and will "change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super accurate cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
Special 25 mm-caliber ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive actually works like small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a gap.
It is also not protected from above and when it falls on a deadly rain of steel bursts, it can also put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use the "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, obtains a specific target point, according to which he corrects his target site and supports the relaxation.
"Let's say you've reached 543 meters."
"When you press the break, the weapon loads and shoots at a distance of 543 metres more or less 1, 2, 3 metres," said Audette.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer to Astro Park their workplace which is currently located in the office building of Place Mareinbader in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its Bad Homburg branch to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday, the giant specialized in computer manufacturing and maintenance, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg City, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Stra√üe Street from the Niederrad Quarter of Frankfurt.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together 100 other jobs still scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the employees' working methods.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just tenant.
Director General Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location with a remarkable infrastructure for us."
He claims that the connection to the airport is precisely of great importance to a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of a major enterprise within the region yesterday aroused the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The economic affairs officer of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its establishment is an important impetus for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have proposed our assistance to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relations could not have changed to the difficulties of the computer manufacturer in the face of the owner of the Marienbader Place building.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding such an exceptional place from being unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and dancer of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'H√¥tel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu company and the "small vertical" neighbor, as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
As a result of a joint project by the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the City Hotel, which raises many criticisms, not only because of the impressive design of the surfaces that once served in part of the parking space, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advice company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved to the buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Frankfurt Specialized Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group, which is based in Tokyo, is considered to be the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch located in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has much more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, left Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the seat of the Confederation of Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has evicted from its servers the specialized website in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This may hide political pressure following the publication of the hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, apparently lives in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with ever more force.
The Wikileaks Cyber Activist Group no longer has access to its host server so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called the other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, probably lives in Great Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Free speech in the country of freedom", the cyber-activists at the origin of the revelations via the social network Twitter said Wednesday (local time).
Earlier, the cyber-enterprise, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks' documents from its servers.
Following the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the largest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Great, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
CNN, quoting Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the inquiry conducted by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The president of the Senate Commission for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I wish that Amazon would take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications by Wikileaks for classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, monstrous and unscrupulously, and thus puts our national security at risk and life worldwide," according to a statement by independent senators.
"Any business aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should not help Wikileaks to disseminate the content of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is listed on the list of persons sought by Interpol.
According to information published by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber activist has consistently described as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the prosecutions brought against him by Sweden.
The spokesperson for Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, told London that threats were made against the site.
"Calls were even launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is particularly worried about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was obviously responding to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that Wikileaks' revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the Chief of Government advisor Mr. Stephen Harper stated on television, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone".
Meanwhile, a controversy began between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for the U.S. President, Barack Obama, described as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we should deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the claims of a website."
The U.S. government now completely passes the protection of its databases to the test bench.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed responsible for combating leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for setting up "necessary structural reforms" which are essential after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House is also willing to verify the ways in which the entire administration exchanges and protects the information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to deal with the security of dissidents and militants if ever they were threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We've done everything to get in touch with them," said State Department Spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of the Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day training course organized for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
In fact, where does the whole ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the somewhat modern ice confectioner, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice.
The ice turbine removes ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, disposes it in the glove and then starts selling it.
To find out, we don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna.
But anyone who wishes to know more about ice, cannot avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The sorbiter manufacturer founded the ice university in 2003 so that ice creams released from its machines would respond everywhere to the high Italian ideals.
The three-day training course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice and extending over several days are also offered. Also, practical sessions are held in private ice cream.
In the middle of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk realizing their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, there were 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, Brazil to Saudi Arabia and Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of artistic education from California, is a fero of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose in the future a quality European product in the country of the Industrial Glace.
Anke from Berlin is a company management consultant and she wants to take a few years to draw some of the uniqueness of this work for nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening ice cream in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housewife came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The glacier master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
It is decisive not only the good taste, but also the silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first stage in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats up to 85 degrees through an electronic program, then cools immediately to four degrees.
It then opens a faucet installed on the machine: a white pasteurized base cream comes out, a foundation of all kinds of milk ice.
The trainer is immediately asking questions: Is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can we give free courses to the personal pleasure of the experiment?
Mr Luciano warned against being misled by the spirit of time.
The one who speaks only of ice "made from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example of guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
Of course it is possible to manufacture ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will cross nothing but ice granules.
Certain changes to the basic mass are permitted.
It becomes more exciting with aromas.
Master Luciano sets out the difference between the ingredients that are acquired in the fruits or confectionery of the supermarket.
In addition, there are dust and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to trace dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass that, by adding eggs becomes a yellow cream and constitutes, when added cocoa powder, the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must move on to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to manufacture four types of ice: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The various types of fruit ice are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit pur√©es: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The hazelnut ice does not necessarily include the taste of the nut, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The very popular kiwi ice is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly reflects the taste of an ice," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is a calculation exercise: if fishing pur√©e is used with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar should be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is necessary for lemon ice.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (vinnerons use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the calculations easier.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
It is not only the machine of automatic manufacture of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device in which you simultaneously beat the ice mixture available to make it ontuous and reduced to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, light cracks are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo shaves off fruit pur√©e from head to toe and thus crushes his fellow students when the control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano believes that a "such incident is likely to occur in each course: it's only a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experimentes with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has cored the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the Expert Group Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for assessing the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the president of the Efsa group of experts for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi pressure group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestl√© or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in developing the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr.Then.
The requirements laid down in paragraphs correspond in textual terms to the positions of the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the industry's trade mark which would be, in substance, controlled by the authorities installed in Parme in Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
An Efsa high-ranking official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta without condition or transitional period. In doing so, She changed camp.
Not long ago, even Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which raised the suspicions of both the German Federal Environment Agency and European Members.
However, the Efsa does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of the Efsa are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admitted that he was working for the United States-based International Life Sciences Institute.
This organization considers itself a neutral forum for experts who, among other things, belong to the field of science, industry and policy in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without a feeding test in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the effects of genetically modified maize causes the field," said Mr.Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not all genetically modified plants, which do not allow reliable results.
"If we don't look for the risks, then how can we find them?" asked Mr.Then on a tone accuser.
This is also Mrs Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been doing research since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as well as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are hardly any researchers who are not related to companies.
In the company's view, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck said that "the industry controls security research".
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell has obtained a total of 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart station with her back tube.
There was a manufacture.
It was snowing.
History is known: In September, the excavators came and began to demolish a large part of the northern wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people have protested against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the cessation of construction work.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the coquillier limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement that was badly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr.Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He's been looking for some pieces of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically declares: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and earthly."
He claimed that when he cut it to the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He still does not know what he will do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
the traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to an old munitions deposit of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man is trading old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were beaten or disappeared in the dump," he said in his office located in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He reports that he was the subject of insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had purchased the rest of the northern wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of Project S21.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the weight-weighted stone parallelepiped on average 80 kilos, with a value of between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a memory while also hoping to make it during reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 complete loadings of a truck.
About half of them are still trapped in the forest, with the rest being long sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, private owners.
They came from all over and took everything they could get into the safe and the trailers.
These stuttgart scandal stones have for a long time become "M√§uerle" or limitations of grass-band plates.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"wasn't this political component."
He enters his car all over the ground, turns around his vast 20-hectare empire.
He did some legal studies he had abandoned, and later he began studying biology before taking an interest in computer science and eventually becoming a career.
And a stone lover.
He's stocking 40,000 tons.
He loves his treasures everywhere in Germany.
He claims to be the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's on his mind.
Scattered sandstones with art are laid on snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbr√ºcke Bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, said with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that climbs through the forest.
It shows a pile of finger: Red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Goli travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertine from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the St Blasien Cathedral, the tuf from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What a job, what a effort, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thought that the stones were once hand carved and moved with simple palates and carts drawn by oxen, he became quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were to be part of it."
He didn't get rich, much less rich.
But today this career employs 14 people. In addition, stone cutters, a sculptor, a forgeron, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding," says the waste recycler.
Soon, he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones there to save.
Skill struggle to conquer high potentials
The counter is in deep influx.
16 students flock to buy small bread from salmon, tomato sauce and white food.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the vehicle manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in mechanical design and engineering to a workshop.
As part of a competition of ideas, they need to talk trades about the car of the future with VW designers, and, by the way, to know the Volkswagen firm.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in the competition to identify better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in multi-faceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most skilled graduates as much as possible in amphitheatres before they arrive in the employment market and are not courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify the outstanding talents in the framework of practical projects and to trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the technical university of Brauschweig the automotive group amadodo the talents.
A young woman from the staff service shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs to young talent; she shows them the ways to access the group's premises.
It is Nico Selle of the technical university of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industry and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can meet the students, look closer to the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into line as a collaborator."
According to Mr Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive we're trying to attract students with.
"At times, the focus was on the professional project," said Selle.
The fight for the conquest of the new graduates will become much closer.
In many sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by doing a sorting on a roster of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and above all shorten the highly skilled workforce.
These are mainly the graduates from the engineering lines who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineers' association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI's forecast, the gap in engineering positions will be further expanded.
Roman Dykta goes to talent hunting on behalf of KPMG, audit firm, accounting and advisory expertise.
It organizes costly talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a sort of paper rally where competitors need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year so that they can go this way to the United States.
Participants can access KPMG subsidiaries and know about the company.
The participant shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr Dykta, the means used for the search for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little."
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we have remained in touch with all those who took part last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their applications to our company soon," he said.
Apart from direct softening carried out on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises proceed in quite a classic way by participating in the trade fairs where they engage in brain hunting.
"We try to reach the graduates by participating in the professional trade fairs."
"For example, at the solar technology fair," says Sitha St√ºbe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company located in Bonn employs approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. St√ºbe was aware of the issue of succession.
At present, 35 positions are put in competition on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It costs a lot and takes a lot of time," he says.
Another way to establish contact is to go through university teachers.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, such as the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to perform professional internships or write his or her final study project at home."
Onerous advertising campaigns are announced by solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"A large group often cannot do this," said St√ºbe, chief of staff.
Money has long lost its primary role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care, or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany's top 100 employers.
The Institute is an annual honour table for German employers.
To this end, it asks employees about their satisfaction with their work and context while looking at the employees' framework conditions.
The head of staff Ms. St√ºbe hoped that this placement would enhance the image of the company with job seekers.
"I think the candidates are focusing on external evaluations with regard to a potential employer," she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies that wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
It advises its customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means, above all, taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"the satisfied collaborators form the best messengers."
When employees are treated well and identify themselves with the company, they themselves advertise their employer to their friends and knowledge.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," said Mr. Kriegler.
Obama brakes on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, the state of the south-eastern United States, in the coming years.
The Washington Government has issued a ban on an equivalent ban and has therefore permanently cancelled its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains currently prohibited.
The Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion, in April, of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform that causes this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with this life-saving accident at eleven employees and leading to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, indicated that he was willing to permit further drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating black tide in golf is not, to date, permanently resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing claims for compensation of several billion, is at the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry created by Obama must present its conclusions in December.
In October, the Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar lifted the frost from the drilling decreed after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter safety instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after many charges of corruption, is currently being reformed in depth.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that he would remove the lucrative fiscal niches of oil and gas groups.
The players in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the flow of food in the Gulf would be significantly lower than so far.
"The government's objective is to put a stop to the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" according to the results of a current BDO audit firm survey in the sector, prior to the ban on drilling issued on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what will change exactly with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to new order, to the detriment of growth.
The country Ogoni is dry
The water that flows into the rivers is brown oil; it smells like the smell that exists in the gasoline station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil destroyed the country of Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live in theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't get exhausted," the ecologist activist to the journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian attempted to photograph a young man immersed in muddy water up to his chest, as well as the fat sled around him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the burst of water in the color of the rainbow.
It cannot be seen that the basement is full of brown crude oil mats.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells us that she used to collect shrimps by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have been completely tari.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil has flown from an oil pipeline that exploded in the immense tide.
Fishermen living in the nearby town of Bodo now have to cut for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The whole extent of the devastation jumps to the eyes as we travel through mangrove marshes through streams of water.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat cracks a brown crading water. Anyone who dives into it pulls out all the oil cover.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from soil as ice sticks. The isolated palm trees sadden their palms.
Bird clouds are sought in vain, as is usually found in wet areas: As soon as the off-board engine stops, a ghostly silence falls on this paradise of old that resembles a service station by the smell it smells.
"What is happening here is war against the environment," said Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent health hazard."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield besieged for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. It was executed later. In 1993, the Shell Group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today again, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this society: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are unexploited, as the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred meters rise in the water of steel tretels as strange sculptures: It is very affectionately designated "Christmas trees" the heads of drilling holes.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are crushed by corrosion up to the marker.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time in pieces because a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion litres have spilled into the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that which has flown into the sea during the super-petrol accident "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
Who should bear the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution?The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, the sabotage and siphoning of the pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider the explosions of drilling heads and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner reproached Shell Group for applying essentially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the failure rate of conduct is still much higher than in the world.
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of cams and installed in the open air: They are completely bare and covered with cambushes up to the neck.
A spark fire under one of the many barrels that are sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without reason on the site must be identified: a small underground refinery.
We heat crude oil in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
At first, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the conduction of kerosene drops fall and we finally get diesel.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators daily produce four 300-liter Diesel barrels: "This reports to us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
Delta's inhabitants benefited from the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price less than the ridiculously low price of only 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: For they buy their raw material free of charge.
It is offered by "protectors" who put the oil pipeline network in perce across the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country thus loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a very insignificant small part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include members of politicians and high-ranking soldiers, bear the lion's share in tanks and bradent on the world market.
Activist Akpobari believes that the debate on whether environmental disasters should be attributed or rather subversive activities to the population or the mode of lax production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishers' lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries."
But, in the meantime, Ogoni's relations especially with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was no longer a question of the withdrawal of the group. "Maybe operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will prove to be better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's a long time that you're out of control" announced the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can show up at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will not be arrested, but at the most they will offer them wine pots.
Even soldiers mainly from the north of the country intend to enjoy as all Nigerians enjoy the raw material.
"In all respects, this great thing has brought our country down very low," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major security problem.
By examining an aircraft that has made an emergency landing, the investigators have discovered a possible lack of construction that can lead to "catastrophic reactor failure."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
As early as November, Airbus passengers belonging to the company Quantas had so far been more likely: In the course of its investigation, the Australian air safety authority found that the reactors of certain A380 aircraft had a serious safety problem, and warned against a possible lack of construction.
This potential failure could have serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of oil pipeline, is indicated in a position published this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of reactors".
Reactors manufactured Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 A380 series aircraft are concerned.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land urgently on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now initiated prosecutions against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which allows her to take other legal measures against society.
The Director of Quantas, Alan Joyce, stated that his company would claim damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts have been detached and the bearing surface has been damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the burning of oil that is at the root of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors now need to be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators announced that other safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesman for ASTB, Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered to be important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After his plane's emergency landing, the company Quantas had fixed its entire fleet of A380 on the ground for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey plane is the world's largest line plane.
The fall of snow all over the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered with white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
The chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany grelotter: By ice temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
The traffic is highly restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked on an ongoing basis, but they could not come to an end from the snow that did not stop accumulating.
In addition, violent gusts have swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects the sea-breathing to take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow masks on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the bad weather warning plant Metomedia announced the level of violet alert was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it's the highest level.
In places, it fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and cold winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stuck at night.
Even in the Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities have reported serious road disturbances.
On Highway A2, snow and wind caused a break in traffic and caused plugs.
In Thuringe, snowfalls affected motorways A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious railway traffic disturbances occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringe and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, trees falling on the railways, chains or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, a ICE train to Munich had to stop traveling.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 train passengers with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The snowfalls have resulted in numerous flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a standard spokesperson and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesperson for Fraport states that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers stuck at the airport are no longer numerous, yet only 400 beds are made available to them.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life during a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Because of the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, so the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car hit a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce a good news: The snow will be always soft and dusty, but it will whirl in case of slight bursts.
But the wind is going to weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by violent and rapid winds.
It is very cold, however, up to 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution seeks buyers for its two office buildings located in Frankfurt.
This building could bring up to EUR 500 million.
The Deutsche Bank has just beautified the group's headquarters: The twin towers located in the Business Quarter have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
Now, the financial group is clearly seeking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for both buildings, as the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper says, quoting a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the intended sale.
He said, "We're checking whether it's more interesting to take care of or sell the buildings ourselves, and to re-rent them later."
As a result, Germany's largest financial institution has already given up its seat shortly thereafter.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for an amount of EUR 272 million from its own funds holders, and then rehabilitated them.
Energy optimization transformations have, according to some indications, taken up approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, the experts in this business sector estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green Towers", to about 500 million Euros.
According to the Spokesman, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be resold to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the children who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for buried minors who were reported dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
We had not yet been able to climb the bodies because the security situation of the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the damaged well, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no relief teams were able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that minors had no chance of surviving.
Until now, the bodies could not be raised.
Today, parents and friends have organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a shining sun at Greymouth in the south of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 minors buried, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including surfing clothes and boards, also had their place.
The flags were set up in front of all the public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants of the celebration that New Zealand had given hope that minors would rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pits said he cannot resign to accept his son's death until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Juveniles of South African and British origin also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
Relief workers started to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when explosive gas masses are displaced, burning temperatures inside the mine begin to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is Splitter an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the ancient genre thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising", epic of the fighter.
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about by turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken captive; he releases himself from his buttock and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents after each other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal killing methods. When he is in a bad mood, he rips off the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to be killed.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the bungalow does not say any words about its real name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, from the back of one or two sentences some fearful cries of agony.
Otherwise, there is nothing said and there is a feast in the incredibly beautiful Scottish mountain landscape that is the setting of the Vikings universe about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travel.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn has been regarded, since the publication of "Pusher", his trilogy related to the drug dealer and full of style, as a kind of Quentin Tarantnon Danish, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant knowledge or introduce a little less brutality to the art and trial cinema.
Most of the art cinema's supporters must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and to the intestines.
The lovers of action films die of boredom, when the village embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to shut up.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" found no film distributor in Germany and that there is only DVD format.
It is mainly because of the beautiful images of misery that deserve some attention, but also because the image of a striking film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
These are not dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is ambiance, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
The viewer cannot escape it.
Refn just gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a grim soundtrack, but above all with an insatiable hatred that slips out of the character's heart.
Only a young blond boy, who is faithfully standing next to the bungalow, preserves some innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the Boragna hero whose furniture is never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by becoming a warrior, is perhaps sending the devil himself.
It represents rot, but perhaps also, nothing but those who are, in any case, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which has the purpose of frustration, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious terrassing work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a stand on this issue, even less subject to the agency's controls.
On the night of September 5-6, 2007, at least four F-15 I fighter planes attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building in Syrian territory.
It is located on the side of the Euphrates; the largest city in the vicinity is 30 kilometres away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is found in IAEA documents, because it is a question of the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in parallel stone pipe, hidden in a valley marked by the lack of electricity current.
According to a briefing by the United States intelligence services, the CIA, from the end of April 2008, would be able to produce plutonium, which would enable the manufacture of atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video with blurred satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the nearby building, or even the interior of the building.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is hardly more information than at the time, and even in time, the mystery is becoming more and more thick.
The former President of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had little clues showing that the country was developing "an active nuclear weapon program".
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and only talk about a "presumed reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation as "applausible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as IAEA.
Questioned about how he ensures that he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat from the United Nations gave only a laconic response in the summer stating that the IAEA had "sufficient documentation to ask questions".
The Syrians have certainly taken away with haste the debris of the "unused military building" and proceeded with a methodical flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite imagery from commercial providers through a Member State showing the timing of the attack, which appears to be more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that it has never realized a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus argues that uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA claimed this argument after the particle analysis by making it unlikely.
Since then, ladies has denied any discussion on this matter, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection on the El-Kibar site and refuse access to the wreckage of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel remains silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in exercise at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
This is how the long-term investigation of this case has been pending since June 2008 without achieving a result and that it "becomes increasingly a serious issue of the Agency's credibility", as recognized by a senior Western diplomat in service at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, it is finally a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other facilities that must have "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
Until now, the inspectors have not indicated which facilities are here, nor what is their function or what is suspected of holding them.
According to information published by the newspaper "S√ºddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also of the names of the neighbouring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute of Science and International Security) in Washington identified these localities and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is located on a military base or directly next to it; that is exactly why Syria refuses to access the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that Syrians are concerned that the inspection group is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is information provided by U.S. secret agents that attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone pipe pipe to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat told Vienna that at least one facility could "serve fuel production".
It would have "no indication of sensitive activities", such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
However, there is a rigorous assumption that the following fundamental questions should have been raised: where uranium should have come from and where plutonium needed for the manufacture of the bomb would have been separated later.
It is unknown whether gravel, which could hide valuable traces, has been stored in all three sites.
When hundreds of loaded trucks have disappeared, no one will have information on the place of storage of the gravel.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had examined in 1998 the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from El-Kibar, across the Euphrates, to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
Recently analyzing photos taken by satellite on behalf of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former IAEA inspector, Robert Kelley has established a link between these and the reactor in question.
Photos taken by satellite show, however, that Syria has undertaken terrassing work in all three suspicious sites and moved from large containers when the IAEA began demanding access to these sites.
This may be a coincidence, but this has not helped to dispel suspicions.
He said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA had spent several months developing a plan for inspections to be carried out, which was intended to enable Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time invested shows the great interest of the inspectors in this case.
In the meantime, Damascus has also rejected this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not mentioned the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for this case, for example, Glyn Davies, the United States ambassador who has been discussing what special inspections have been known for a few months, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The IAEA Director, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, certainly already spoke of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he hesitates again.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority of the IAEA Board of Governors and a large number of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation under way.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to reflect: "It would be useful if at the end of the day they found nothing"
Love in Time of War
It's been wrong since Angelina Jolie made her debut in the summer as a director.
She wrote the scenario herself: it's a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but it's enough to cause the discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian buttock during the Yugoslavian war.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested, and in response, certain shooting sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film was filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continued in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet the actress. Jolie herself is the good-will ambassador of UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic says.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says quite a bit about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner to withdraw the capacity of good will ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But in fact, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its scenario, granted a shooting permit in Sarajevo after a few hesitations, but we do not know why it did not come after that authorization.
The young author assures herself that she does not pursue political goals with her film, that it is by making a lot of efforts that she has become aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity to all parties taking the opportunity to express herself.
However, it remains vague about content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
This still makes a big difference with the version "a rape victim falls in love with his burrow".
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, as Jolie put it, is "unfair and based on incorrect information".
Now, only Hollywood's fanatics can bring him peace: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, it's all right with the Irish again.
No trace of consternation.
This is why the local team overrules visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout with joy at the bottom of a loud music, they suck their feet.
Cork Bayleyu-Pub in southern Ireland vibrates because players launch and succeed in dropping table tennis bullets at a distance of three meters in beer pellets of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "pong beer". The winner gets 500 Euros plus a plane ticket that allows him to go to Las Vegas in January to the world tennis championship.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computerist, these two behaviors don't really go well together.
And yet, in spite of this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terrifying issue, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will conduct hiring interviews in New Zealand.
"But I feel strange," he says.
"The home country is so far away and I don't have a job."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she picked up her desired job as an evental project manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their chance abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, his brother Colin now serves as a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish people will soon leave their country.
They even predict a 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts come true, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed great ease, sorrow now takes its place.
However, the economic crisis is particularly affecting well-trained young Irish people who have only experienced moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's too much money.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten people under the age of thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times publishes a lot of letters from readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything is drifting."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunity, goes away, and so our country is a whole generation."
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future because the government only throws the powder in the eye and offers young people no prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades crumble from one practical internship not paid to another.
She states that their greatest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" exhibition which offers full support on the theme "working abroad".
"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the career hierarchy," says the manager.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gateway, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Se√°n O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to be done in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house just comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan only rarely visits his home country, because he participates in an additional job, in order to be able to complete the reimbursement of the credit contracted to build his home in his home country.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says by crossing the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live almost no longer."
It bursts out of a embarrassed laugh through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of large brands are parked on the access routes.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, funded at 100 percent by credit.
"These were times of madness, no doubt the money was easy," he said.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, reserts hot tea and says: "I don't have children to keep and I'm young; even everything goes through, I can start at zero."
The engineer of the building does not like the lamentations he has often heard in recent times.
"No one should be hungry, our situation is not as dramatic as what we once lived here on the island," he said.
"Working abroad for a moment is not what can be worse, perhaps that's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughed and then talked about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life just went on."
This idea pleases Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life happens elsewhere.
In his palm tree, He already has a few years of work in London. That's why life must not be as easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is one more thing that worries him about the last few days: the celebration to be held on the occasion of his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a farewell night.
"Only not a lot of emotions," he says by drinking a long gorge of beer.
"Adieu, it seems still worrying."
"Let's call it a good-bye evening, relaxed, bringing together some friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
The crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the last Latinobarometer survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it follows changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, democracy support has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, reducing the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction at the way their country's democracy worked in practice; it was the same as last year but with a strong increase of 25% in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% said they had confidence in their country's Parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but in a sharp increase compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook up support for democracy.
While this has been well maintained during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have suffered only a short recession and have received a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only slightly increased in 2009 and again decreased to 32 per cent this year.)
But mood varies considerably from country to country (see Graph 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
More rarely in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been severed and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see table 5).
About 31% say that they or one of their relatives have been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure has fallen compared to 38% last year and has been the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest driver in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered the country most influenced by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was far worse than outsiders who wanted to help the disasterd country and plunge into fear.
Voting boxes and a new ballot were presented, ballot papers were distributed in the guilds, polling stations and intimidation.
The polling stations would open late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who had been displaced following the January earthquake, were wandering in the vicinity to find a place to vote.
Some of them have finally given up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, denounced fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, sees the event as "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they "did not believe that these irregularities, as serious as they were, had necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are liable to Ren√© Pr√©val, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude C√©lestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapist, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr. C√©lestin, who has little or no perceptible support in the electorate, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second bulla at the second turn.
With a cholera epidemic that rages, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors who still live in tents, one feared that participation would be.
In the event, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Almost 250,000 identity cards, needed to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
The weeks after becoming suddenly widowed, Cristina Fern√°ndez, President of Argentina, received a public sympathy wave that improved her approval rate by 20 points to more than 50%; this is her highest level since her election in 2007.
However, transforming this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Mrs. Fern√°ndez, visibly in mourning, according to which she would abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, N√©stor Kirchner.
And, in that respect, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeds him as president, was used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs Fern√°ndez's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition was divided, and the situation was gloomy as a result of Mr. Kirchner's death of a heart attack on October 27th.
Some dissident members of the peronist movement in power joined Ms Fern√°ndez.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian hit one of his peers in the face and where others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
At present, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even more room for manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is largely overheated: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is now 11.1%, but there are many private estimates and union wage claims, that figure is close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was afraid of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which has falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fern√°ndez now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high global prices for agricultural exports from Argentina.
But inflation has eroded the rate of growth following a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fern√°ndez shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with the bondholders who had refused an earlier forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fern√°ndez seems to be edging awards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to what it is some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economics, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices; this is like a prelude to the remediation of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fern√°ndez wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer on her side.
If it does, it needs to gain support from the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is very popular.
When the Argentines have returned from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for it will have reflowed.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to reject many of her husband's policies without any noise.
A Half-Hour for China
Taiwanese voters have been oriented towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million electors were present on November 27, representing 70% of eligible persons, to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general evaluation by the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma has also become a substitute for feelings over the continent, which has created innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the greatest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. My test was successful, but it's fair.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) won three of the five mayors, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has gone into full independence in Taiwan, has won nearly 50% of all 45% of all KMT votes.
If it had been a presidential vote, Mr Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main subjects of the Taiwanese elections, including tapping country trucks and mass gathering flags with girls who danced in minimum outfits.
A mandatory attempted mysterious murder was also perpetrated.
Sean Link, son of Link Chan, honorary president of KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man of the crowd shot young Mr. Link, through his face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Link or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning the voters to the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking to see how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, KMT tends to avoid disrupting its ties with the government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from attracting anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed a confirmation of whether his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that Beijing's government will continue to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy to draw Taiwan back to the dock.
China has wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start with the beginning.
Better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has been reinvented anyway.
Two years ago, he was wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a challenger for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was praised as a PPD candidate for the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's haste approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems overwhelmed by this change.
In a statement published from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted on Taiwan being a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic, not to fight the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have a hard time choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT must make an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite a vertiginous economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesperson said that his office and his local offices would be remodeled.
The successful results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's rapprochement support is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a selected surprise in the category "Best New Artist"
Carry out at the request of a president, and people are required to learn about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer who was handpicked by President Obama to take place at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a major nomination in the category of the "Best New Artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since its 2008 album, "Esperanza", the appointment remains somewhat mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist should not release more than three albums before the recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line at Spalding compared to the shining success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for the voters of the Grammy Awards taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the voters of the Grammy Awards have rightly honoured Vijay Iyer Trio's "History" in the "instrumental album" category, a turn on a frisson reviving a recording that was one of the top favorites last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" of the veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the clavierist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, favored by the loud voice of New Orleans and frequent guest at HBO's "Treme" was honoured in the contemporary jazz category; which also strongly leans towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the wild Darcy James Arge, familiar with the steampunk, has won some well-deserved awards in the great category together; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a good example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group leader.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards each year include a mix of landscaped musicians and composers from around the world.
In front of the nominations, mention Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California, there is Estonian composer Arvo P√§rt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in high school for a reward.
The classic appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
One category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The names for the classic album are the Bruckner No.3 and No. 4 Symphonies of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificum - the Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and the Green Requiem of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg's "Lulu" of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse of the Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" of Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Choeur of the Marieinsky Theatre; and "Ivanho√©" of Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition count P√§rt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
P√§rt's Symphony No. 4 took its first place at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was named for its solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said he soon wrote the 15-minute work especially for the performer at the Avi Avital Mandolin, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of North African ranges and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez received an appointment in the orchestra benefit category for leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received an appointment are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-Andr√© Hamelin; the organizer Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only solistic vocalists; here are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonov√°, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixtures, Soprano Jessye Norman received an appointment for his recording "Racines: my life, my song"
The Temecula Mosque project wins the approval of the Planning Commission.
A Mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the Local Planning Commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics took up this project by claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic bottlenecks.
But the Commissioners decided Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention him," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I am proud of it, as an American citizen."
"This shows that justice takes him away."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, at almost equally distributed speaking time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," wrote one speaker.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty killed in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, the September 11, 2001, bombing site in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmush has denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Its Congregation of 135 families co-exists without incident in Riverside County for years but wanted a space larger and better than the warehouse it rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square feet mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32 hectares site on Nicolas Road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerating arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That is why it is very special, even though it is far from being a truly "foreign" form of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in the online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, are able to continue to develop after replacing the phosphorus with the arsenic.
"We wonder what's still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the research of life beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, generated widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of an extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other global environments, organizations could be able to use other elements to act biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrology Institute, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"Consequently, organizations have a hard time distinguishing these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like the phosphorus; it penetrates inside and somehow erases the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
Researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the Earth's existence, she said; thus, researchers suggested that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there may be other ways of shaping life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exposure dogs were found in Compton
The other two exposure dogs on four stoles from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the Los Angeles County sheriffs announced it on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akitas and two corgis pembroke Welsh - disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 from Bellflower, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening, said Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are doing well," said Whitmore.
"They are in good shape."
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, what neighborhood and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in an animal shelter in Downey County.
The sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were healthy and except, the authorities announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of Japanese dogs, were brought away until their discovery Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of Long Beach's "AKC/Eukanuba" national championship, where they were counting on Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other scheduled events in the days preceding the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, said Peek in the Times Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour of almost a month of the couple.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and keep their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppy, a lander Parson Russell and a Breton Spaniard - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, in the thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They've opened the windows a little bit, so the dogs can look fresh.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck's flight at 6 o'clock on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to corgis, with a microchip installed to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward has been awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to roar again, the restructuring of MGM no longer waits for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green light to start at zero.
A federal court judge of New York Bankruptcy officially leased Thursday the plan "pre-packaged" by creditors that approximately $5 billion of the debt would be cleared; opening the way for the entertainment company, with 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television shows.
With the Thursday decision, according to which the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no further legal obstacles remain before MGM to re-float under the supervision of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become directors general of what will be a light studio.
Staff will be reduced to approximately 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has entered into a $500 million credit facility, planned to finance the new operations and productions of MGM.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself faces $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was initiated to advise management on how to place its finances as it did not have the means to pay interest of $300 million a year.
In August, the Director General, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in recovery known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the more than 140 studio creditors took much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, auction sales attracted few bidders, including none of whom were willing to pay the sum of 2 billion more of whom creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything needed to be done while the MGM team had begun to work on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal disagreement and debate, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially exits bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive several million dollar premiums for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper's companies, which collected $37,000 a month for their corporate management services, will receive a "success" premium of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to relaunch the production of MGM, which only released one film this year, and to set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jump ropes, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholeesale Club BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Law of Moore has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the battery button toys are increasing, as are the rechargeable battery toys.
Here are a few recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are toys of the size of an Indian pig that sing a note when you press them on their belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second one makes it possible to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start supporting, you can't stop.
To combine the dance song, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animated doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
Children who have signed the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the 1980s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a back bag filled with questionnaire game cards designed to transform a car ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve classer.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The Mobigo of VTech ($60, for 3 to 8 years) is the least expensive and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3-7 years) uses an iTunes-type system to offer electronic games and books and is equipped with an SD card entry that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a matchbox, each having its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6-12 years) that includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy online code, your child receives enough credit from Club Penguin store for two items of choice.
It can be roller skates or a company animal toy Puffle.
slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and over) is the last button cell micro-robots.
The false beast moves quickly on 12 vibrant silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to do a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also strong.
Ours resisted a drop in the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Bring a softer side to maintain order in China
Tang Shenbin arpent a place in the city as an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nerve charges, with a low voice of orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of theangguan - who were responsible for law and order in China, who were afraid and despised for their arbitrary repression and who were looking for violence - to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"You're right!"
"Be sharp!"
Show them, he says, "What do pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely passed adolescence in white gloves, dressed in robes and identical olive-coloured pants, were looking out for you.
Four pairs of black heel shoes, aligned to the rule.
Four caps perfectly perched at the top of hair attached by a striped knot in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they look average," said Mr. Tang, with detachment.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of urban inspectors in China.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher education degree.
The province of Guangdong has traded the green gray of the uniforms against a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the lower-eyes with the strong way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by looking at black, firmly for half an hour, until the co-rapporteur repacked his business and part.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to do a major imaging operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in urban areas of 13 women, especially chosen for their appearance, their goose and their young age.
The idea is to give the degross police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have difficulties in attracting attention to this underground urban brigade of China
And because of that, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media reveal the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in the province of Hubei beat an observer to death after he used his cell phone to film them in a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without issuing blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon collector was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained at the assault of street vendors.
"Chenguan marked the government," lamented last year China Daily, a national publication, after a controversial debate on tactics.
The newspaper called for a "true complete cleaning."
Skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district passed an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real tasks or whether they were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district announcement required women candidates, aged 18 to 22 years old, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five features of the face in good order."
They must be larger than the average size of 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1‚ÅÑ2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is compulsory.
Officers stated that work was physically too difficult for women over the age of 25.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are appropriate; this is the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "interior qualities."
Chenguan's women are like flowerpots, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that the requirements for height were the standard standard in many Chinese employment offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement for the order of the facial features.
That this means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or disabled persons must not apply.
"We can't let a person who drinks or a boss come to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheeks pommeled with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the emphasis of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked for a dexterous air.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old colleague, said, "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They did not object to their limited mandate, they said, because they nurture greater career ambitions than just hunting the sellers on the streets where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces about a dozen travelling merchants who travel quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as much as possible small breads or tofu bowls before taking the flight.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you many times!" said Mrs. Xu when a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning her noodle-cart bike.
Officers describe their functions rather as monotonous than hard.
"It's about the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to seize the property of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exhibitions of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after the spread of false rumors that Ugandan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overthrown or fired.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks of houses in the plaid place Baoguang, where female officers were patrolling this morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as prescribed by the regulations.
The owner of the bike screamed at the scandal.
A 15-minute arm of iron followed before the police, on their sinister face, took a elbow path to their vehicle and departed at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male team coordinator, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - 40 years of age or older - are purely supportive.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"At times, we fight physically," said Mr. Li salid of a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the public that starts."
Prosecutors will not blame Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Department of Justice lifted the criminal charges brought on Senator John Ensign, arising from a case related to an assistant in an old campaign and his efforts to obtain a lobbying job for the husband of the woman, announced Wednesday the Senator's lawyers.
The decision put an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the republican of Nevada, who was considered a possible Republican candidate to the 2012 Presidential until the scandal around his case did not make the big national titles last year and damage his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" with the decision, a result of a one-year investigation.
The honourable senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "reported that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to hold any charges against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice has abstained from commenting on this matter.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise to many lawyers of ethics outside the Department of Justice, which said there would be significant evidence that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the honourable senator's case with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
As Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was forbidden by law to lobby with his former employer or the Senate as a whole for a year.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to be in contradiction with the so-called prohibition of the rotating lobbying door.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there seems to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and substantially violate the law of the rotating door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from an investigation by the government.
Although the Department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed to be wary of political prosecution after a number of high-level backlogs by its public integrity section, including last year's decision to abandon prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take arms, said Melanie Sloan, the Director General of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government official can now assumes the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Counsel of Mr. Ensign, stated in an interview that he had received a phone call from a prosecutor of the Department of Justice on Monday and a follow-up the following day, telling him that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed in a press release Wednesday, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made at the prosecutor's office.
"I'm not comfortable getting into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, claiming that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was all except a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company hosted Mr. Hampton as lobbyist, Chief of Staff of Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him he was "martled" the Ministry of the Interior on a matter in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and he asked the Transport Secretary to set a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the case covered last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his electors and resigned from his position as leader in the fourth republican position in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to hold a third term in the Senate.
By announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Some half a dozen of them were slamming away in the ranks of the courtroom.
They sent every minute reports of horrible testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defence said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the rape case trial and children tied to their beds in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, the largely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence to the court that sketches appeal arguments, which may occupy the courts for years.
What is challenging is that the intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use of Twitter journalists - have created a "circle atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instant with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by the public's passions.
The request could prompt appeal judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in the courtrooms.
"I have experienced this during this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies into the courtrooms leads to a fair trial of the human rights," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, Chief Counsel.
The judge of the trial, Jon C. Bleu of the Superior Court of State, laconically rejected the claims in last week's judgment, claiming that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been animated by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the question.
Appeal courses have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 judgement, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in his decision that there was a "carnaval atmosphere in the trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers stated that the appeal courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be necessary to manage the means of communication of the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of the new media," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue claims that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limited instant communication from courtrooms could allow more fair trial.
The case of Twitter is only one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, who may be discussed for years, which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered harm when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jury, who had been criticized before the prosecutors, and that he abused pressure for a verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to deliberate on a weekend.
The jury wasn't kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, tabled last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for the position of governor and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media did not stop attracting the flames of the excitement of the case.
"The daily riot of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "was nothing like what had been seen here before, in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that the new snapshots were more incendiary than the more slowly released releases was a ludicrous view that would undermine the Court's policy governing the media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said that appeals were often attracted by the arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insisted on this claim.
In their case, they referred to the Supreme Court's 1966 decision, which overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "representing that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civilization bring the cleavage closer?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civilization broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a pre-couror sign of genuine bipartite cooperation towards the front or an illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress has produced no insight into the big issues to be dealt with during the "boosting duck" session.
But obviously there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties and the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
The public meeting of Wednesday of the Committee on the President's deficit was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological divide; however, it still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to state that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a period of mutual testing and testing with a view to obtaining signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
Therefore, Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether taxation, spending, health care, or rights, both parties remain miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed over the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Ethics and Public Policy Centre.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
The elections spark partisan passions and then startle.
That's good."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the "Boyous Canard" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or the whole, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, only because Republicans cannot afford to give themselves the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for rich people, while refusing unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After the Tuesday meeting at the White House, more optimism on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on "Boyous Canard", with the ratification of the "New START" Pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the session of the "duck blade" will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress will meet in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, even inevitable.
"Once the things that must be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civilization would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or a shadow-boxing compared to the 2012 main event, he said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present in the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial responses to the deficit commission's recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, reducing retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their own view, imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a manner that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the committee, composed of 18 members, to issue their plans as an official recommendation, and they have had difficulty reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected members of the group, suggesting that there are at least today few reasons or wills to compromise on tax issues.
Galston foresees two phases in the fights between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care, and then be followed by a period of greater bipartite cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely demonstrated that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans always want to see both parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as in 1995, then the two parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
The one who will be found in loss will have to change his mind and find compromises.
However, it would be an optimistic view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there were then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more significant election in 2012.
In view of this reality, the civilization exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take a lot more effort on both sides to find a common ground on the issues that still divide them.
U.S. released documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and passes some of the wine pots and money it collects to the Kremlin, reported the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of power" - takes its part as the money goes up the ladder.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been expelled.
It was written while Iouri Loujkov was still the mayor of Moscow; and it is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but since then there have been few cleaning traces.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied charges of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these charges.
In September, he declared the following to a Russian television channel, when he was questioned about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupted: "It's crazy, it's to throw, it's anything."
The Russians believe, to an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupted; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy account; and it is unthinkable to conceive that it would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it "dysfunctional" and to claim that the government worked more as a klepocracy than a government," according to the ambassador's note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (the term used in the criminal world/the mafia which literally means "top" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow City government.
"The analysts to identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, MVD and militia are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is targeting the money of the largest companies and that the police target the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understood that it was preferable to obtain protection from MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high."
The note indicates that, although the collection of money is extended, protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subjected to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev referred several times to the fight against corruption but admitted little progress.
The embassy's note conveys reports of men carrying bags, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's "think tank Indem".
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He is not part of a political class because he does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the costs of corruption would amount to more than $300 billion a year throughout Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy note, which was only realized yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will surely stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow's failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that the problem is being solved.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin made the assumption that WikiLeaks' documents could be a manufacture and reacted angrily to the statements that US diplomats had made by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem is that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect it would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, as opposed to ethics."
Ancient Fighters of the Red Khmer forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with poor-quality concrete walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School spoke of the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves your Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said Mr. Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Reds, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Reds in northwestern Cambodia where he had hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures built; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, long-standing loyalty was finally called into question at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation enabled the victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, taught the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led with the United Nations, issued its first sentence concerning a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the notorious torture centre in Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Yev, better known as "Duch".
Faced with this evolution of the situation, anxiety has increased among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge of Anlong Veng; making reconciliation efforts and their willingness to re-enter the Cambodian society.
"There are resentments and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent agency that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the red Khmer was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowed the Government of Pol Pot-U. in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements took place in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrillas of their base located in the western mountains of Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a follow-up at Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a United Nations-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Red fighters began to defecate the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had been leading, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending trial.
Without their beneficiaries, most of the red Khmer veterans have sunk in black poverty, common in rural areas of Cambodia, and many remain nostalgic in the movement.
Although some Khmer Red elite officers kept their positions as local leader in exchange for having laid down their weapons, these are low-grade and record-qualified farmers.
"These people received very little follow-up after capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are imbibed by the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in a framework where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the red Khmer was good," he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to support our own needs."
The current Khmer Court has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court should initiate the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer red minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the senior officials and the main perpetrators of the crimes, but did not state whether he pursued beyond these four cases.
There would be more to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, former district leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodian Documentation Centre researchers that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have been killed.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem came back from work in the field near his wooden house on pilotis, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who failed the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court pursued several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodge must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces, he says.
"We need to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "A story of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They're suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the court will pursue."
Such resistance made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he says.
However, the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a path, invaded by the weeds and parched with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black silk, covered with a rusted sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old mobile phone vendor on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who was incinerated at that place.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she says.
It was the anniversary of Nuom Sothea and later that day she planned to walk to the last place of rest of Pol Pot where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its military-quality uranium stock
The Government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprising victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqu√© published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with the Belarusian Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov, on the margins of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But US officials told Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of uranium of military quality from a Belarus research centre.
This opened the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the remainder of the material of about 500 pounds, according to an official who referred to the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Safety Summit, organized at the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to offer an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit Security Summit."
"This proves to me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, Chair of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety promotion group.
Clinton described the "very significant, important step-by-step" agreement made by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials worldwide in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
About a dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexandre Lukashenko said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military quality uranium and weakly enriched uranium," said Loukachenko.
"It's our product... we're not going to manufacture dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, they expressed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated, said officials.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and removed, said officials.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by aircraft, according to officials.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus's research facilities with weakly enriched uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A thorough coordination and organization have been implemented with a view to building trust," said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Department of Energy specializing in the Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates from the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military quality uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been strained for years, mainly due to the harsh repression by Loukachenko of Human Rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has made no objection to CIA flights
The government has issued no objection to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in the direction of Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram by the ambassador of the United States to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the filtered documents (cables) by Wikileaks in the daily El Pa√≠s, which add that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, Mar√≠a Teresa Fern√°ndez de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed "to prove that they were exercising adequate vigilance on foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report from the Council of Europe that accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights of some dozen countries, including Spain, of having held a meeting between the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern√°ndez de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "has surprised the Government of Zapatero off-the-spot" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega pointed out that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken to the naked," reports Aguirre in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel √Ångel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente Gonz√°lez informed the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," explained the Embassy after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless expressed concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the declassified information of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination among independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly among Governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007 during a luncheon between the ambassador of the United States and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo P√©rez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even though Spanish judges are madly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid the comments of an inflamed rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly benefit from any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if such disclosures have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she said.
The parricide that passed to the confessions complained in the network of the "accadailment" of being mother
The girl talked about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "T error to the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fern√°ndez is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used when she was little, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two from Noia, the village of the Coru√±a of which she originated.
The messages date from 2008.
To hear them, we need to know his sentimental life, which ABC built with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iv√°n Tu√±ez, an industrial girl.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby belonged to him, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elect was Alberto, a young man from Lusame, a neighboring municipality.
She's been living with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idyllic broke down, they separated.
In March 2008, she was in Menorque, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and ugly because I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed a good thing to him, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day long and not to have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then, she's talking about a mobile message she just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child."
She complained: "If she doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home," she said.
In May, she spoke of the return to her village: "This week I leave, but I will only stay until 19, because on the 20th I must present myself to a job not to lose him".
She explains that if it was all right, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will stay with the right person, i.e. with me, and I will never leave him with someone else if that person is not my mother," he means, taking into account their bad relations.
In July, there's another post.
When she hits him, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and had allegedly been murdered on the 10th, is dead.
"C√©sar is happy on the one hand, but he's not on the other."
"On one side he's with me and this place he likes a little, but on the other hand he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Majorque.
"There will be (the child) a few hours in the summer and so I save some money from the baby-sitter."
The 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss on the part of Caesar, who asks me when will you come."
"Alberto says he sent you, I don't know what videos to e-mail, you see, whenever he wants, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there's one: "I'm getting ahead of money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the Prison Liberator."
"T error to the Galician (epigrapher)."
The last man who lived with her, vigilant, declares his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything happened so she didn't tell her that she was a single mother.
Monica entered the Palma Provincial Penitentiary yesterday, from the Juvenile Court Center.
The Office's lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she doesn't remember how the facts had happened, "and she didn't intend to hurt the minor either."
Before she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defence and prosecutor requested a psychiatric trial.
The members of the People's Party would earn 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the 18-N results, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of L√©rida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MPs recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training obtains in these comencies normally doubles the number that it receives in Catalans.
For example, the Catalan people obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomouss they obtained 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, desired by a diversion of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, was maintained, the analysts of this training calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could move from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now 10) and PSC would lose no more than 9 MPs (has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a Member - he has three now - while ICV would hold a Member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal comencies, where people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay to the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and populars agree that the PSC could lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, L√©rida and Gerona, where the socialists would also not obtain the majority of the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican blockade, it would not be fantastic if this formation lost its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes-.
The PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, L√©rida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep F√©lix Ballesteros.
In L√©rida, the PP only recorded a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, of which Mayor Angel Ros maintained very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
People have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of locations.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaida
Aside from the seven detainees in Barcelona, Thailand, there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerians detained by officials of the General Intelligence Commission of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the author of the Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, in order to ensure that with "operation Kampai" has "summer debilitated" Al Qaeda's international falsification apparatus and "consequently, its operational capacity".
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that incorporated the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, and this is why the investigations involved, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, so in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days similar to the one recorded on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) in Thailand another one, with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikalaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who were leading the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - stole mainly from tourists passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents were to be on behalf of young men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connects prisoners in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before this attack was committed, Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after the components of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have taken a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
PPC leader Alicia S√°nchez-Camacho had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign and that he manages to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-Soverearian adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address half of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans came to the meeting with Arthur Mas with the security that gives the fact that he obtained 18 MPs in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to get loved, because the CIU candidate requires at least one of the trainings that will be exercised by the opposition to vote on the investment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but for the time being, the conversations Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investment "all the sovereign and independent discourses should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders shared their bets to make the political apparatus thinner of a very exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to estates and donations.
Details of the negotiations on the Mas investment will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcerc√≥s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Solidariat Catalana).
Geriatrics claims that the dead were not due to the "lack of measures"
The owners of Olot Centre do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
Geriatric officials La Caritat d'Olot (Gerone) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilm√©, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people whom he was responsible for in the meantime working there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the lawyer of the centre, Joan Ca√±ada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to carry out the charge against the responsible" for the dead but "legality and responsibility obliges us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer in order not to have detected in time the criminal activities of the nurse at night, the great threat to Caritat now takes the form of a major compensation that the legal representatives of the parents of the victims already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilm√© admitted that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that from that day he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formalities took place by telephone.
Caritat, through her director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures may at no time have been the cause of what happened".
The attorney for La Caritat added that "in this case there is only an indication of imprudence on the part of any other person other than the accused."
The person already baptized as the "Ange de la Mort" confessed yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused her to die by injecting her with an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The Director of La Caritat mentioned that it is complicated to control the access of the staff of the Centre to medicine.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or, on the contrary, he burned them inside by giving them weight as he has already confessed he did with the three women he killed in the 12 - 17 October period.
Caritat does not believe the statements of the nurse at night, nor the number of assassins confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justifying their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in her visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change in the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB Threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to the Trichet threat yesterday, which warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The differentials of the peripherals have closed in force and the actions of the European banks have undergone more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to cheat and the euro has barely increased, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way as it falls, it recovers, but motivated by closes of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retire tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt acquisition plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary future liquidity measures and leaving unlimited access to the week only.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and will continue to be sold at quarterly auctions at unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and that we will even give the signal of intensifying it.
If they fail to meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blind to withdraw the liquidity measures, God helps us!
As well as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and collapsed markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year trade auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have dropped 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
The figures for the Allied hole and Bank of Ireland were published in Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million short-term and 15,000 potentials and have a period up to February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has not yet had sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy anthem.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the action plan that the Council of Ministers would approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors' ears such as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange suffered 4.5%, the double that the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefited from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year obligation that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will be solved with a strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
For Spain to request an Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million available liquidity, triple from March, to very expensive types and they cut access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being, to be born."
Courage, we can get out of it!
The president of Eulen will contest the council of Vega Sicily requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the √Ålvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David √Ålvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers it "nul de droit", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, solicited by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the holding firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David √Ålvarez and his sons Jes√∫s David and Mar√≠a Jos√© grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control by the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding for the companies does not seem willing to give in to his dispute to be present in the executive organs of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who became directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year, whose contest is registered in the Register of Commerce and Corporations.
El Enebro's judicial council for the next 16th, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, reopened the box of tuna in the √Ålvarez family.
The use of the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The latest movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira √Ålvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David √Ålvarez as a "desperated recourse of the applicants his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly misleading the Law and abusing the law, to validate and correct the assembly radically null on 18 January", according to his official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis so that, once the assembly takes place, it is contested considering that it is "unrightful".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried without success that the magistrate convenes an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David √Ålvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the service group is asking for 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for a challenge for which there is not yet a date indicated.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
Software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new race that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering skill as a champion driver, German Sebastien Vette, nor the capacity of Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very distant objectives from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly chains for manufacturers from around the world, energy stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, simulate faithfully the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding the defects and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains the fact that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 plant allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in very few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In Red Bull's team today, there are 180 high-skilled young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of changes to the diseases.
Siemens' leader explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's disease except the engine, which is Renault's sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can shift from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological development there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to create and produce its bulbs in a town 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
Staff for this duty include 580 people, including two drivers, the Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1 is probably the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the notoriety is nothing.
The plant's technology director, Steve Nevey, said five years ago, it could be said that R+D's progress in racing cars brought 50% of the wins and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of success, while pilots bring 15% of added value.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by IT, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of 20 businesses between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain in the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Ingl√©s.
HP Spain's Vice-President Helena Herrero gave as an example the remodeled store located on Barcelona's Gran V√≠a, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American Group prepared a plan to implement 200 branding points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish establishments.
The first opened were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one of Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Director of HM personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of the exclusive furniture of shops (with products that can be interactively affected), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers training of institutional staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive trading network claims "to improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, post-sales and even packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a global pioneering pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP's computer equipment in guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht, Holland.
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," noted Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bet on "fly" a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
In spite of this, it foresees a collapse of the margins of interest, which will be tried to compensate partially with increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture within three years one million individual customers, his task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and can thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 which will have a three-year viability.
The objective, in addition to surviving without needing to use FROB's public subsidies, is to earn a market share through the capture of one million new individual customers - 700,000 if those who can come out of the bank are deducted - its great task to be accomplished, since so far this bank has spoiled SMEs and companies more than the individual customer.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share to individuals is 3.5%, while companies exceed 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same thing, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when presenting the results of the fiscal year.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disturbed all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year's Optima Master Plan, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for an additional exercise.
Customers who let the savings banks escape will be their main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the liability war - which penalizes the margins - is reduced, the price of risk premiums that banks and cash banks pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity are already moving to the credit price to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We didn't tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoD√≠as on 22 and 27 November-.
He also admitted that the banking sector's trend now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "we will ask for bigger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He states that capital requirements "increase enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that FROB can replace the market in fund-raising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that we cannot issue, but instead of what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the banks
The ECSC Director-General, Jos√© Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and stressed again the speed with which the restructuring of the sector takes place.
When the merger of Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve themselves for the second phase.
However, Jos√© Antonio Olavarrieta, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Epargnes caisses d'√âpargnes (CECA), rejected yesterday the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been carried out, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the group of Banca Civica is a second phase, they are adjustments."
"Most have been fully realized; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated much in this operation as well," said the leader.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process is "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is achieved within the deadlines set in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
"The passage of 45 cases with an average of 28,500 million assets volume to 17 with 75,500 million is an unparalleled trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to conform to Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unhappy opinions about the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of serosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remind that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year".
The Executive Director of the ECSC, Jos√© Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world and has attributed it to those who question it as a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic conjuncture, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that began a concentration process "very important" and "go at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had taken advantage of the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but it has established the conditions for the entire Union.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary in tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or removal of EUR 426 without a professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of EANA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe Gonz√°lez, joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel with regard to her responsibility for detaching the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which is shocked by maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, incorporated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, Mark's recovery, even if it now seems to be science fiction, with a very favourable opinion stream, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, fiscal rigour, fines to countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (plans of fiscal rigour and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second round of the Central European country was when Merkel had hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on, she was criticized fiercely, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published one were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expresses a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time forcing private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European because it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, was approved and, in the following months, we should attend the Union reform process that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we have to take measures with which we cannot agree too much, from that date on the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves ceased and, in that case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany points out that we must follow a strong path of growth with high savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
It's clear.
And it would be bad not to hear it.
It is not just a matter of reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're asking is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring greater tranquillity to us.
And let us grasp the opportunity we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with large companies and the announcement of yesterday's new measures) suggests that despite Merkel's criticism, we have opened the way to the the thesis that it is necessary to put order into the house.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the opportunities we are considering, it is not possible to exclude the abandonment of a monetary area that is too steep in low-serious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The russians similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will to escape a penalty.
The horrid expulsion in principle by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23 November match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused a lot of ink on the anti-sportive character of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, just a few minutes before the game was finished (which their team was already clearly winning), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, the two players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next game of the Auxerre dam game and will be able to pass without cards in the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned with two games the team coach, Jos√© Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow cardboard under circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate appeared in the related case is due to the fact that this has been the protagonist of a team of Real Madrid (who in his anthem displays nobility and honour and who, on past occasions, has condemned a fine to its players for similar acts) and orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds an episode more to his dilated history of histrionic and provocative technicians.
In any event, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour does not explicitly prohibit the principles of sport, i.e., if with these actions a fraud is committed by law; because, in fact, they are actions that are respectful of the sport regulation, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of injury they cause in the sports spirit.
One of the assets that understands the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put at risk, that is, there has been no violent game.
Another of these goods to which we refer with the right game is to prevent the team from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not accommodate the fact that one normally characterizes it as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been carried out in secret to try to avoid punishment, but their action has precisely tried to be as evident as possible to receive the penalty of the arbitrator.
They were waiting, and they willingly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders obtain from the deliberate errors examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that we do not put ourselves in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and we do not get an advantage in the same game either, because of course the result of the action implies leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Of course, the advantage is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated immediately and apart from that, with this action players perform a penalty match and pass to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than the first cycle.
So, climbing the steps, it's not so clear that this is an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which is still part of strategic decision-making that promotes the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (it would be a clear case of fraud of the law), but otherwise they chose instead the time when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without taking the penalty or escaping it.
Although the boundary between engineering and the fraud of the law is widespread, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of engineering.
The controversy, it seems to me, appears due to two factors: because there were two self-expulsion and because of how to transmit the director to provoke them.
The harm caused by these actions to the principles of sport is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in NCB
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bull and the lottery, when December comes back also the dinner of pre-Christmas groups that continue to be the oxygen ball for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but who because of the crisis led to an offensive price adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide with businessmen and associations in the interviewed sector.
To complete the complicating accounting, this year's calendar (like the night of the Holy Sylvestre falls Friday) concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (on 17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of the difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever the situation is, they all ask for battle prices, confirm the President of Gremi de Restoration of Barcelona, Gaiet√† Farr√°s.
The representative of the employer, now, does not dare to predict what this month's celebrations will be like.
"People think a lot before they book."
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices," he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the tranche around the 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a survey at various institutions in the centre, there is the collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is a genuine demand boom for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the environment, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda et al.), the particularity of the calendar assumed more anticipated reservations, even as early as the beginning of November.
"We did the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they detailed.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after having detected an increase in billing since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18 will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate parties in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as Catalan wine manufactured according to the champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies once again inviting their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On the part of the Fecasarm patronage (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association), his vice-president, Henry Gom√†, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that overall reservations are "animated", even though customers "negotiate as much".
Indeed, hope for festivities has not diminished, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan ' s nuclear programme generates a major concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster rate than any other country".
Wikileaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy of Pakistan and the Department of State of the United States, filtered by the Wikileaks portal, confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear programme in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and delightful details offered on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, rather than increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
This is how Ambassador Anne W. Patterson lists in a report prior to the visit of former National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations in the territory under attack Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose short noise and vulnerability to the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferators and a reason to maintain custody.
"Pakistan has to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan's high level of nuclear weapons production.
An Embassy expedition in May, which calls communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", supports the following: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of aid remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the manager that "the Pakistan Army must end with the tacit support of terrorist groups".
Hunting the Chief of Wikileaks
Obama will number a senior anti-terrorism officer to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol emits a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, otherwise dated November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the last leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creative lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange".
On the 20th, the international police force based in Lyon, France issued Sweden's order on request, but did not publish it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have been instructed to identify or locate Assange "to obtain its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give the arrest order of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red notice call a free way to arrest -- which the national police body must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is thought to be.
The movement outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to answer the Swedish authorities' questions by video-conference.
They also recall that Assange has requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," she denounces the missive.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he doesn't talk.
On Monday he gave an indeterminate interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that she has been responsible for giving orders to U.S. graduates that they spy on the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described the application for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us," he said for the CNN.
Obama himself has charged a senior anti-terrorism officer, Rusell Travers, with preventing further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to reduce the importance of Assange's contrast with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the Congressman who will preside over the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber from January requested the Department of State to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance".
Further on, Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to return to his statements after saying that Assange would have to be "killed."
"Obama should turn it into a goal and use an unmanned plane or something."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"The one in the Government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcerc√≥s seeks peace in ERC with eyelashes to Charod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerc√≥s seems to have found the recipe to solve the internal revolt within the ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of former leader Josep Llu√≠s Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it cannot give him any headaches he had with other extinguished currents.
That is why the leader of Escerra will try to win his new criticisms with eyelashes that allow him to blunder up to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcerc√≥s announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the Karodists want to pass a certain vote of penalty to the President, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of division and the image of submission to his or her person.
In several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself ratified by half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand the president a little more than making his position available to the military, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcerc√≥s controls the maximum organ between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve with the executive a roadmap until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic direction document that management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcerc√≥s in exchange for its promise to schedule the congress in the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a safe fact.
The ERC leader admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to ensure that once for all the organization is able to wash its linen family room.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered Puigcerc√≥s' ideologue, the holder of Innovaci√≥ thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" was as if he had done.
And he listed five, of which he points out two.
The first, "recompose" the executive to account for at least 90% of the militia, i.e., to include new figures from the Charod Addict sector.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, he defends a reform of the statutes that allows the holding of congresses through elected delegates by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcerc√≥s team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave was responsible for reviewing the assembly model at a specific Congress to reform the Statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this subject.
Now, without critical sectors at all, the time could be good to resume and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILLENIO of the State of Mexico, there has been a 4-case decrease compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the MILLENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are these three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in the Valley of Mexico.
During the past month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in organized crime theory.
Among the cases is that of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl√°n, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of firearm and the blow of grace to the head, apart from the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on the rue Mixtecas in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatl√°n, Naucalpan municipality.
Early in the morning on Thursday, on the 4th, the owners of shared land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the thorax, on the highway near Recalo-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Close to the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day after Nezahualc√≥yotl, a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shots of fire when he left his house to initiate the work of collecting barley.
On November seven, two 30-year-olds were killed by a headfire impact in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, Ecatepec municipality.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the front was found a man's body on a lonely path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body was found a stroke of calibre firearm 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies did a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
The residents of Tepotzotl√°n warned of the discovery of a dead body in Pe√±a Colorado, the hands tied behind it and the eyes banded.
The man had an injury caused by a shot of fire in the neck.
At half of the month the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality Atizap√°n de Zaragoza was reported, at the same time two warning messages of death were discovered with the victims.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony we found wrapped in a bag of black plastic the rest of the body with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the body of a man was located in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario R√≠os, according to a message that his executioners had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck was found the lifeless body of a woman in the hamlet of San Francisco Acoutla.
On the woman's skin were detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with her image.
At the end of the month, a man's body was found on the edge of an automobile in Zinacantepec municipality with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads in the rubble and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Before the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "This is what happens to those who do not align themselves."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside a taxi abandoned behind the Center of Justice of the colony San Agust√≠n.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc√≥yotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the colony Cuchilla Anc√≥n and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next door; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Ju√°rez.
Near him, the officers found a Bristol with a message.
China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the coal footprint and detailed its offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, said Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the coal footprint and re-convert its industry.
In fact, he explained, his country has invested $245 million in the last four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He noted that the Chinese strategy in the area of climate change is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the targets for greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the federal authorities worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local authorities to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reductions.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both funded by the Chinese Government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Effective Use Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for changing incandescent lamps by economic lamps and another mitigation and adaptation, he has detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government's scientific advisor for climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than we thought.
For example, he explained, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and plans to make it another similar by 2020, he said.
Expulsion of Espino: C√©sar Nava
The national leader of PAN has detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of PAN, C√©sar Nava V√°zquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In the interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cu√© Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, by making a complaint to the Order Commission of the National Council, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he explained that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for presidential candidacy.
Nava V√°zquez expressed his conviction that National Action would be stronger after the internal elections of December 4 and 5, where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach to local elections that have been successful and achieved its goal," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we will taste it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council may be able to elect the best leader that Action Nacional needs for the next three years, so it would give the role "to the person determined by the council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He planned that the relaunch recorded by the party in the last elections on 4 July would be reflected in the next argument, even though "it is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"At the moment it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cu√© in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have become "a lot of hope for them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticisms against President Felipe Calder√≥n for his speech during his four years of government, C√©sar Nava asked the Prisists to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calder√≥n; that they begin to defend them; that they come out of the cabinet," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions such as those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no staff in the country, and less censorship.
Obama promotes the law for paperless students on Twitter
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call on your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," tweeted the U.S. President in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today for national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize paperless students, with a message in his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call on your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," tweeted Obama.
His short message maintains an open cyber link to a broader document that calls on the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote in the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we hope for soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on all legislation if the extension of tax reductions in Bush's time and government funding continued.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican Blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential Spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved, an agenda can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this fiscal problem must be resolved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he was going to request a "closure vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize paperless students could be voted on next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, have remained in that country for the last five years and have been accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the project's partisan organizations have an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed his term as Senator Mel Mart√≠nez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his posture so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles in the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature you put your finger on the wound
The second step of Language Pleasures was a walk in which the participants shared the story
"The sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the plague? what do you expect from me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of his question (while another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound "...we put ourselves in a lot of embarrassment" launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young people, who met at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shuultz and to whom Valenzuela, Sergio Ram√≠rez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garc√≠a Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa as the first person who seeks to know what the "plaie" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes convinced: " patience is not my strength, it may be my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is opened in reality, the symbol is the scar".
The protagonist sighs relieved and concludes: "on the wound I have only been able to know that it is open in reality and it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very related to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram√≠rez also presented a thrilling narrative that he called Eloge √† l'invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at some point is discovered.
With touch of magical realism, he spoke of a famous sorcery that touched clouds, turned people who had gone far away or repaired the virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that turned to speak America, the great news that had had from the beginning her own chroniclers and quoted Bernal D√≠az del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the narratives of the conquering captains.
"Certains who invented us all (the writers) mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that even lacked the stink."
Nevertheless, he stressed, "fools and liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, we no longer know which part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is actually called the 'Tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is because of his inheritance that we are what we tell."
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table owes him on the wound.
The Cuban-Portoricaine has put herself on the great plague of social violence that her country is experiencing - and Latin America shares - produces disputes about drug trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, the good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after mentioning that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the author.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis Garc√≠a Montero who also emphasized "this must be on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at a high speed as well as with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that is to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every assertion there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means a lot of times to put the finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very comfortable thinking in cartoon, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and also to disturb the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting them to recover the sense of writing.
Romano to the hunt for his first title
Rub√©n Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had tops and bottoms in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast marked by the results.
Rub√©n Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals, he has had tops and bottoms in his career, but he has managed to reach three times the decisive series, even though so far he has not put in the thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special to him.
Argentina ended up consoled with the medal of subchampion, he remained one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The saintly strategy came to its first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reigns of Morelia with which he lost with a overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closing he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournoi, again against the Devils, Rub√©n suffered again a reverse, because his team played an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump at the result of 4-3.
Rub√©n lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival to the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to get rid of the evil so he can celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I'm going to get the title, but what I mentioned earlier is more important," commented the helmsman when he was asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the final, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the referee doesn't breathe the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to shoot us we were already prepared to run and I think this is a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we just get ready, the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately fate has made a bad turn, sometimes it's the emotions or the anxiety of holding the title in our hands, hands he has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we will not get into that situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to be no longer a subchampion technician and to taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining visas
People must go to Visa Applicants' Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011, the procedure for the treatment of visas at the Embassy and consulates of the United States will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to attend the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC) prior to their interview with the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be revised by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will provide certain benefits for applicants, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to obtain an appointment, another payment for the processing of the visa and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visas will not be required to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only present themselves at the nearest AUC where they will present the documents and be fingerprinted.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be collected in the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Ju√°rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.
For further information on the new visa application procedure, please visit the following page: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boltines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. Space Agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate an astrobiological discovery tomorrow Thursday, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 13:00 a.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for astrobiology experts, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured her that it would present what would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which led to speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that we thought was too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from what we know."
The Space Agency will communicate the true scope of the discoveries at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will participate in the geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturne's largest satellite), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and Opposing Block Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, we denounce it.
The 60th had just settled down when in the Congress there was an opposing bloc led by PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes√∫s Manuel Patr√≥n Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before beginning the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr√≠guez of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD; and Patr√≥n Montalvo, 'tonnes' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we are starting 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four deputies, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Director chaired by Paniste Salvador L√≥pez Brito and Luis Antonio C√°rdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these reforms institutionally, the political marginality of PRI and PAN is constituted.
He mentioned that in the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme from political will and if they do not, they will be again served by both parties and in this way the opposing coalition will end.
"So far it has arrived (the opposing coalition), that is what I am looking at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they do not even have the political deviation to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr√≠guez, from Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patr√≥n there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow, he continued, that the Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolytic".
"It is not the spirit of reforming the law that there is eternal bipartisanism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and now they talk to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent has plenty.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT explained that the Congress has now become a 'good' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patr√≥n Montalvo asked to respect the member's personality, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they don't leave us with 5 out-of-pocket agreements that will probably be Members, now the five that we see, separated into different fractions, we decided to join together to find a place in the negotiating table, that's the problem, that in the reform they made, that they decided, we're out, and we don't agree with that reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Mayor of Mazatl√°n pays another cheque to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 thousand pesos favors Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With it, the amount that was paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company is 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "settlement of account suppliers".
The treasurer Luis Miguel L√≥pez Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior hearing to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and therefore how many cheques will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ESA, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasury has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All of this, after July 25, Northwest had published a revision of the cheques issued to its suppliers by the Mayor, revealing that in the period March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel L√≥pez S√°nchez, the City to pay Camacho Palazuelos over 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, in cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be treated
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the S√°nchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatl√°n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a creek of the S√°nchez Taboada roundabout, the tourist sector in Mazatl√°n asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a poor image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Association of Traders, recalled that they have repeatedly called for the image of the destination to be taken care of and new activities to replace the others that tourists find wrong.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists are walking there and they see the disorder and avoid close trades.
"Politicians know only that it means closing a business one day and they don't know the fortune that we lose, elsewhere they didn't do the work for so long and without proper planning."
Hostor Jos√© Ram√≥n Manguart S√°nchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the Mayor.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so, so through a preventive interview and not just make the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist zone, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the Mayor must change his strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlan.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it doesn't depend only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"We have not given them the necessary attention and this kind of fact highlights something that is notorious for all, maintenance is necessary."
Ra√∫l Llera Mart√≠nez, under Tourist Promotion Secretary, stated that the recovery of the tourist sites in Mazatl√°n is urgent because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that need to get together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Obviously Mazatl√°n offers many historical and cultural sites and places that we should first order, clean up and put us online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP asks for results at the Congress
Eduardo D√°valos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
The business sector of Mazatl√°n calls for a decent and free working law between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Legislature consisted of seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, 13 PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, totaling 40 people.
The list of expectations that the new members of the government Congress are clean and committed to society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo D√°valos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
"We hope that Members will actually exercise their right, free of agreement between the parties, because the custom is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and become the carnival mask of the governors and leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
That is why I call for them to certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor makes progress.
"We will ensure that they do decent work and above all engage with society and sectors as the people of Sinaloa have given them their confidence vote in the past elections.
Jos√© Ram√≥n Manguart S√°nchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces seeking the economic growth of the state, as the economic situation is now very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they promote economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators give him the importance of the Government's budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I have understood that it is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as a major economic activity that generates currency and investment and that is directly competing with the agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that resources must be classified to detonating tourism projects that help to ensure the state's safety and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislations have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for King Magi
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jes√∫s, Jos√© Alfredo, Mar√≠a Guadalupe, Isaiah, Jos√© Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live in the day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I leave with the 'plebs' for sale in the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the kids.
Adelaida, aged 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her 3-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old Jos√© Alfredo has long longed for a 'monster truck' and for his younger brother Jes√∫s, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothing sizes for a year.
"He told me (Jos√© Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, my son', because he was very expensive', he remembers with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Mar√≠a Guadalupe, 11 years old, shoes the size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, shoes the size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, shoes the size eight.
Jos√© Juan, aged 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help realize the dream of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela you can participate in the campaign On Search King Mage, giving a toy or money to the reception of Northwest.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
Some ten searches were conducted in Estrie, Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The searches were conducted in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 plants of cannabis, four kilos of haschich, money and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson of the Quebec Security.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two Sherbrooke men.
Arrested persons were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could deal with accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were carried out following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Module of Quebec's Strie de la S√ªret√©, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Board took part in this police operation.
Underground migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which, according to the government, should address the problem of ships loaded with illegal migrants, is obviously going to be beaten while the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created granite under your feet," said Liberal Chief Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow for up to one year's possession of any person from a vessel identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Bloc qu√©b√©cois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because he was targeting the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," said Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected from the backs of his hand critics who wanted his party not to be firm enough with regard to illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree to take action against smugglers, and that is what we do through another bill, C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives' bill because it takes refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians say massively to MPs that they do not tolerate such clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a clown."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," Minister Kenney responded.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections due to its rejection.
However, one Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would request a vote so that each member who would oppose would then explain himself to its electors.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea does not date: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue since January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It should be said that at a meeting of the Standing Council on Police Services in Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for Pakistan's public security critique St√©phane Bergeron to call this ad "puppet out of a hat" and "bricked solution on the corner of a table".
The Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we're going to announce it, he's just saying."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr Charest refuses to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he says.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," says Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadlock, he suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the Auditor General's mandate," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent escort is not the only project in the Charest government cards.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from Operation Martiau's prosecutor, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some amendments related to this case.
During Operation Spring 2001, which struck the biker groups, even though the Criminal Code was not appropriate, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently adopted the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several watercourses remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has occurred in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another slip would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi√®re.
A road's suffocating.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
Additional 20 to 40 millimetres of rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the regions.
Sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
As these precipitations should be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some sectors, several watercourses are feared to overflow.
Warnings on flood alerts were issued on Wednesday night by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouareu and the Achigan rivers in Lanaudi√®re.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jer√¥me, in the Laurentides, and in the Rhine, in Lotbini√®re, were subject to flood surveillance and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudi√®re region, the high rainfalls led to the overflowing of certain lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken by heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the overflowing of certain lakes led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
Civil security remains on an alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
The Quebec River Prediction Centre issued Wednesday warnings for several rivers, including Maskinong√©, L'Assumption, Ouareu, Achigan, Batscan and the Loup.
Partially blamed dupont
Quebec Radio animator St√©phane Dupont suffered a partial reversal before the Canadian Radio Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements about social assistance and Haitians, as well as his rude language in waves.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their views, but that some of the points contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language that did not fit broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two people who committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Quebec Joint Social Assistance Front.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the issue were inaccurate.
The facilitators must present solid rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, the animator St√©phane Dupont considered suicide to be a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the vehicle message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont le noon" have addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame has therefore been held in place.
The last dispute dealt with statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
St√©phane Dupont and Jean-Ren√© Dufort then engaged in a media face-to-face that had caused a lot of reactions.
CHOI's facilitator stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because one could not know for sure that the people in need would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension on that."
"My record has been a virgin for a year and a half," said the cheerleader.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of rough language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM broadcaster collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station which will have to announce these decisions once during the hours of great listening within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Montrealese of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special route.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and boxing Thai climbs on the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, since for those who don't like the ground game in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security officer and as a commissioner for the UPS company has just issued bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Amateur World Championship (WKA) from October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing, he explained."
"Now, I'm getting ready to go to China for the San Shu World Cup."
"The fighters who finished among the first four at the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, I finished eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007, in China, I completed the fifth-ranking tournament, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've advanced to every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san Shu" or "sanda" is a discipline originating from China where punch and foot blows, as well as floor projections, are permitted.
Duels are originally held on a platform and rarely in a ring.
The most famous Pugillist from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to hold only one event in his career, he will surely respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explained the friendly gaillard."
"It is somewhat the equivalent of the Lumpine Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, half-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro, did he analyze."
"There are four combatants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face to crown one champion, the king of the kung-fu."
450 million contracts without tenders
Hydro-Qu√©bec willingly awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor firms that has obtained the most important, the management of the project, for a sum of $295 million without calls for tenders.
This consortium called Energy Administration was set up in 2004 in a manner consistent with Hydro-Qu√©bec's choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium unraveled the lucrative contract without any public tenders.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and lead to an increase in prices.
"It's the new way of collusion and cutting off competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it secretly, are now doing it openly," said yesterday, Pakistani MP Sylvain Simard at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he found it difficult to see how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she weighs, claiming that the PQ had been "bad" and had "lack of rigour".
She said that "it would be the least thing" that the PQ apologizes.
Consortium formula is a common practice worldwide.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scope of the work.
The construction site is under way and is expected to continue until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition; there was negotiation.
Therefore, the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week's duty, the formula of consortia in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A rapid survey of Quebec's business register allows the number of more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
With regard to the consortium Energy Management, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay Territory responds to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Qu√©bec has been responding in a special way since the 1970s."
The great patron of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (SEBJ), has provided an explanation that has prompted the fact that the project's management contract has been granted at will.
"If you call for tenders and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's people's competence," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the consortium Energy Administration is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Qu√©bec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has expanded 22 contracts, Genivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention its participation in Energy Administration.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 management contract for Energy.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known in the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau made it clear that the PQ was also linked to these firms that "financed it", before stating that it was more of its leaders.
Responsible Consumer Barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair trade marks and eco-certifications to guide their choices.
Pis, even if he bathes in a media universe where messages for more responsible consumption are spraying, he deplores a lack of credible information, lacking even calling a brake on his commitment, indicates the responsible consumption barometer, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they have increased the consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Centre for Responsible Consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of the official certifications based on the so-called fair products, but also the credibility of the products and trade marks that appear to be exorbitant, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, the speech of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be crucial to boosting the current animated consumption of nearly a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the lack of information and the questionable nature of the information would ease the burning of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers also claim to be suspicious of the alleged performance of the green products or services they seek to put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habits and above all changed the brand of one or more products to meet their convictions.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases from their neighbourhood traders and preferred the purchase of food grown in their area, the Barometer says.
Greener and responsible - the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - , the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to appear as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by caring about animal protection.
However, his social and ecological awareness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers reported having used public transportation or had called for co-cars to defend their green interests.
The walk and bike were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just taken its first click.
A State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, who was asked to commit financially to the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Soci√©t√© Angus and the Parallele, agrees to collaborate, but only with a loan.
The Soci√©t√© de d√©veloppement Angus and the Parallel, which expected a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois from the eXcentris cinematographic complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent by giving him his full Cinephilic vocation, do not get what they demanded.
The government agrees to be involved in the file, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of sources from the state offices.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been reviewed downwards.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Soci√©t√© de d√©veloppement des Entreprises Culturales (SODEC), Fran√ßois Macerola, who is the leader of the eXcentris dossier.
He sent him a final report about ten days ago.
But the firm's counter-proposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31st to answer.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the State's gift must really be ruled out.
Recall that the Association of Film Owners and Cinema Parks of Quebec opposed a direct investment from the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinema halls.
But a number of stakeholders in the community called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of ceans, has for ten years worn the cinema of author in his premises of the complex after having financed his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shouting in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to loyalty his clientele.
The Society Angus and the Parallel, with their head Christian Yaccarini, are driving, on their side, a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, one of three screens, Le Parallele, has continued to broadcast eXcentris films.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three halls on 27 February next by designing the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remember Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of downward proposals that are made to them.
The veil raised over a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks turn the veil over what the United States considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians to the Americans, but at the same time they betray their superior feeling toward Canada.
Thus, American diplomats wonder that every Canadian elector does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by voting and believing that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, held in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to get under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, either in the middle of a federal electoral campaign, relates to the extent to which the United States is not one of the issues discussed by the political leaders.
To the great surprise of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations of this situation.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may require Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of the daily life rather than to have this election held over the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he wrote.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the elephant proverb of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The ambassador understands, at least, this "sudden silence" that both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Seriously, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more than one party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when voting."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is found in the cable sent on January 22, 2009, by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government in the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will display its first deficit in more than a decade due to a $30 to $40 billion recovery plan," said Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that opposition parties made their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast at CBC refer to the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O broadcasts, where there are few references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA's abductions for muscle interrogations.
Another cable relates that during their first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guant√°namo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the case-by-case.
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he handed a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, let's note that the spirits warm up about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC's waves that the responsible for this massive flight should be "killed".
He listened to Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the United Nations proposed to Canc√∫n a plan for the renovation of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, which is almost one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan lies in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Canc√∫n to compensate for the lack of binding commitments for reduction by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that monopolize still 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, better, electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to enlighten humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the global car park.
In Copenhagen, last year, major issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have engaged in voluntary reduction plans that are expected to shift global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But we need to subtract from this balance sheet another 5 Gt to stabilise by 2020 the climate to 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in heat and the rest, or 5%, produces light.
With fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, this need for energy is reduced by two more times.
Fluocompact bulbs last on average from 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those released by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company has also participated in the study of the United Nations - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with an alternative plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats as well as emit very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have posted reserves for fluocompact bulbs, since they contain mercury and have to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact bulb, but rather the coal thermal plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce waste electricity in in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants, which would cost it 2.5 billion.
C√¥te d'Ivoire Expects Nervous Annunciation of Electoral Results
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has called for the "without delay" publication of the results of the presidential election in C√¥te d'Ivoire, after the expiry of the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the interim results without further delay," said a spokesperson for the UN Chief."
"He calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to exercise responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission allowed the deadline of Wednesday, midnight, without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday vote.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the CIS President stated on television that the Commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied on Wednesday in the world so that the CIS finally proclaims the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulous" votes in the north, held by the former Rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup d'√©tat of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of the FN voters in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the president from voting.
Any election may be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are accepted by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dr√©, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northman who denied any connection with the former rebels, considered "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he claimed victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that he has filed a complaint before the Constitutional Council, having prevented the electoral commission from spreading the results, would be illegal.
The Presidential's second round, Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained split in two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan B√©di√© (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in Metropolis (9.7% counting the overseas departments), showing the provisional seasonal changes (CVS) corrected data published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in metropolitan areas.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the population working in metropolitan areas and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate is rising by 0.1 point.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available in the two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has still deteriorated, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, to 24.2% in metropolitan areas (+ 0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed within the ILO.
Seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolitan areas (+0.2 points over three months as well as over one year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only the 25-49 years have benefited from unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolitan areas (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini under review and in custody
Alexandre Guerini, 53 years old, head of waste processing companies and brother of the PS President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne, was examined and crushed at the Luynes arrest house, near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guerini was questioned for abuse of social property, diversion of funds and public property, reproach, active corruption, trafficking in influence and detention of ammunition, her lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and wants to explain all the questions the magistrate will ask him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue it for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it's something else to prove them," AFP told his lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guerini, brother of the strong PS man in the department, Jean-No√´l Guerini, had, through his lawyers, put a memo to the judge before his hearing.
One of his close friends, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined on Wednesday evening and collapsed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but operate the landfills he had to handle.
As to the allocation of the markets or the destination of the funds related to their operation, he had never known about them, said Mr Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the Abbagne agglomeration services, was examined on Wednesday for diversion of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a prohibition to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide explanations of the facts against him."
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of liberty," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released on Tuesday to Wednesday, with legal supervision for two of them, said Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for the Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is continued for "traffic of influence and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Agglomeration of Aubagne, Mich√®le Duval and Christophe Brindisier are being examined for "removal and diversion of public property by one person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity of diversion of public funds".
Finally, the companion of Alexandre Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "abuse of social property".
Among the people who were confronted with Mr. Guerini was St√©phane Brunengo-Girard, who had recently been involved in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in Corsica.
Investigators suspect their companies that they have used money from big banditry to bake.
The investigation is conducted in the context of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 as a result of anonymous mail, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public procurement, particularly in the waste sector.
From a source close to the survey, the investigations focus on the conditions of allocation and operation of a discharge from La Ciotat, which collects the waste from Abbagne and certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: the Elys√©e exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", held the opinion in halene in France, put diplomacy on the alert, and intensified the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the eye of the diplomats of the United States.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how the Elys√©e explained its strategy to the Americans, even giving them advice for the treatment of their own "hostages" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French had not been granted in return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by American justice for the trafficking of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they are in stark light of the way the French Presidency has sought to manipulate the media in order to acknowledge the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
Elys√©e's advisor for strategic affairs, Fran√ßois Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meet with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals who have been held in force in Iran.
"Making noise," they say, "martle constantly" in the media the words "rights of fundamental man", "innocence", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Make it all the more so that the Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because, after the attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", Iranians are "masters in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day it takes refuge at the Embassy of France) "will require the Iranians to be paid a large sum of money" (230,000 euros).
And he reports that the Elys√©e anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains locked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose United States is demanding extradition for illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released to Paris on the decision of a judge.
The US Embassy, like many observers, is asking about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, who is tracking Iranian clandestine nuclear equipment acquisition networks, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, Fran√ßois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elys√©e, he said, not only "was he completely surprised by the judge's decision," but he tried to oppose it.
"There were strong exchanges between the French Presidency and the guardianship of the seals" (at the time, Mich√®le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judicial decision", he observed.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of French intelligence services.
Elys√©e's advisor composed a telephone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elys√©e does not spare its efforts, through media releases and "flashes" organized in the media, to make it believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role of "mediar".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that manipulation bears fruit as several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes the 'blitz' media of French officials.
On what is based on so much "gratitude" expressed towards Mr Assad, the Embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials recognize in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then discusses the reasons that prompted the Elys√©e to pay in this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria," he analysed.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and immerited".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "show Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "seed seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran√ßois Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least sow confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elys√©e.
In a communiqu√©, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called Cinderella Act that will prevent adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have indicated.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people under 16 years of age, indicated representatives of the ministries of culture and the family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and the right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the departmental head in charge of the bill.
Online games will be accessible again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government also plans to request companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people who are being asked by their parents, he added.
It will also make available to people who demand free software to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, compared with 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: Fifa designates the organizing countries
In full torment due to suspicions of corruption, the Executive Committee of Fifa designates Thursday the organizing countries of the World Cups 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying may take the lead on technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the competition queen of Fifa will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities included in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, Jos√© Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Jos√© Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruelff) provides the measure of the economic and political issues of a World.
Backstage treatments are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the Fifa evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh heavily on the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, which led to the suspension of two EC members of corruption (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined his country's chances, the birthplace of football that hosted the World only once in 1966.
The BBC gave a layer of this on Monday, publishing a documentary that pins three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What the Fifa is unhappy about and embarrassing the English officials, who have launched into an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of the government hopes to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for London the organisation of the JO-2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to recoup England's blaison with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal lacks assets with its already ready stages, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could shower their ambitions.
Possible reprisals against English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's rating, becoming an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings of its file (streets, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced an "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against members of the EC.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," Mr Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strong in the 1994 experience, appears as logical favorites.
The first world economic power, the seat of the main sponsors of Fifa, seems to have a long advance on Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, ardently desired by Fifa, which would in fact lapse the Asian chances by 2022.
With Qatar, who came out of the big game by proposing futuristic stages, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion to new lands, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights paid (due to the time gap) by European countries, the nerve of war for Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made it appear that he hesitated.
Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One warrant to the Elys√©e calls it another.
So the current head of state will be candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not make good household with the mystery part attached to the presidential function.
Then we have to pretend that doubt still exists.
In one sense or another.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a strong air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured him that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
Let him mention in front of MPs UMP, Tuesday evening at Elys√©e, the prospect of "two mandates" has therefore sown a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far away.
The president simply recalled that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited the number of five-year years to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the Presidential, on the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"To the worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he launched them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His earlier remarks did not make him more candidate than the previous one; they did not do so.
If they make comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to the PS application, on the one hand.
But it is not the entrance to Royal Segol√®ne law that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is because its 2012 candidacy is clear that many PS demands an earlier battle order than expected.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer Fran√ßois Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP above," he immediately and cautiously responded to the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he believes the defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Jupp√©, pointed out.
Euro: the ECB obliged to maintain its procurement of State securities
The last meeting of the Board of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the modalities for exiting the crisis or at least announce the termination of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed at the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis requires that Frankfurt's issuing institution may not be able to afford to be as peremptible as it is to worsen a situation more than today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not wish to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...) ".
On the eve of its hearing in Brussels by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more dissipation as to his intentions, merely indicating that the programme for the purchase of State securities on the secondary market was "continuing" and that "we shall see what we will decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main management rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB's purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly ‚Ç¨1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased ‚Ç¨67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the anticipation of further procurement (see page 29).
Economists also do not expect a significant change in headings.
If lending operations at more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still proceeds to unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine she's significantly changing her program."
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of creating new short-term tensions," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates Norbert Br√§ms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its intervention on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these obligations to enliven an atonous market", adds Norbert Br√§ms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a mix of yields paid by the most fragile states," testified an important mandatory manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates fly, States will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, or to stabilize it.
The safeguard of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government has turned its back
After a disturbing start of the week for Italy, the situation was somewhat relaxed yesterday, with the decline in compulsory rates at 10 years.
A return to precarious calm.
On leaving a meeting with the Minister of Economics, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation as "unspeakable" and expected an "unforeseen" weekend, which the person then denied.
On Tuesday, however, the gap with the German long rates had reached a record of 210 basis points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had flown to 263 points, resulting in a certain inflation in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, has declared himself "strongly concerned" by "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the attony of the tax revenue that goes with, running to the state the risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the current budget in the Senate is based on 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget group that could be put in place after the holidays, for a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, either in the short term or in the long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested in Italy are less than those requested in other countries", notes Pier Carlo Paduan, OECD chief economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which early elections could be held at the end of March.
There would then be a bad period for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde also hammered her yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe, are still shown on Sunday and at night, are obviously solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although all relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European State obligations brought water to the government and the ECB's mill.
But we can't talk about a start of standardization yet.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could degrade the debt score of Portugal, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and visibility, which weighs particularly on banking systems," said economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
More and more, "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it faces, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the most directly concerned Finance Ministers and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
This is also for the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin from the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the collimator of markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began in Singapore on Tuesday a tour of Asia to inform the extreme-eastern investors of the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it will certainly prepare the field.
The first EFSF securities emissions are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an American official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries that are at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, for their part, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms in addition to closer austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from those of Greece and Ireland.
Both have at all costs to avoid seeking international assistance before putting in place their own budgetary corrections and to decide on the structural reforms needed to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors focus on the options available to accelerate the process of normalising sovereign obligations markets.
On 24 November, Axel Weber had the first idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an increase of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism, with up to now EUR 60 billion.
A council that has every chance to be carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Neige et verglas: 24 departments in orange surveillance
Snow episodes still cause problems in circulation, particularly in the secondary network in Brittany, and may disturb certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange surveillance due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loire, the Deux-S√®vres and the Vienna, joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde later in the night.
According to Met√©o France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or up to 5 cm for the region of Paris.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, C√¥tes d'Armor, Finist√®re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow episodes are sufficiently remarkable to create traffic difficulties and disturb certain economic activities, warns Weather France.
In the C√¥tes d'Armor, several departments were banned from weighing more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loud√©ac axes.
The traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking their vehicle only in case of need and the movement of certain cars TER has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was prohibited for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the circulation of heavy weights.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the utmost prudence on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Civil Aviation Branch (CVI) requested airlines to cancel Thursday 25% of their flights at Roissy Paris airport and 10% to Orly due to the coming snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate about the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been full, billions are raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion is mentioned for the Grand Paris Metro to be built by the Soci√©t√© du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the state announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this amount that will then allow the GSP to borrow a share of its double loop funding from the markets.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The Correctional Finance Act 2010, considered in the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the start of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in office tax in Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Soci√©t√© du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, to increase its product and to allocate this increase to the Soci√©t√© du Grand Paris".
How much would that be?
Mystery.
It's not encrypted in the text.
We're far from the $4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources add to the EUR 4 billion of the capital allocation that will be mobilized by the state and brought to the Soci√©t√© du Grand Paris as the project progresses", can be read in the explanatory statement.
At the GSP, we don't find this shocking system.
"From the time when revenue is created (the two taxes, ndlr), studies over three years can be covered and tapped in the 4 billion after that, we explain."
"This will be recorded in the budget and drawn as and as per."
The GSP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised are still absent subscribers, may lead to a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Revenge hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in the case of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound international changes, and prefigures a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on the sexual habits of Berlusconi only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those whose Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi's caricature sinister profile has long been for artists of cabaret subject to sketch.
The rule that secret records should be composed of only new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, not just in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, Templiers or Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the earlier works.
And not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (he doesn't know where to look for news about the nonexistent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only that they already know, and who reconfirms what they have already learned.
That's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited in spirit) the head of secret services (unless he may be, I know, editor at Lib√©ration), who only retain what he recognizes as true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, that the embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of states can call or take an airplane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises of representation, have become spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows that very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that they pretend to ignore it.
However, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker could capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the state department.
So the scandal doesn't make both victims and "bourreaux" into crisis.
But let's come to the deep nature of what happened.
So, at Orwell's time, we could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely proven since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction carried out, the hotel visited, the road borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the power eye.
But when it is demonstrated, as it happens now, that even the crypts of power secrets cannot escape a hacker's control, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected revenger of the citizen - can know all the secrets of the power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said it, that a real secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is true, too, that everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove all power from him.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but did too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, States will no longer be able to put online any reserved information - it would be necessary to publish it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is futile to hope that confidential telephone relations can be maintained.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relations be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction falls within the scope of science fiction and is therefore Romanesque, but I am obliged to imagine government officials who discreetly move in due diligence to uncontrollable routes, being only bearers of messages learned by heart or, at the most, hiding the little information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept as a single copy in key drawers: in the background, the Watergate espionage attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I've had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving in crabs, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegrapher revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wire telegraph (telephones).
Video cassettes (analogic) allowed film researchers to explore a movie step by step, going forward and backward and discovering all the secrets of assembly, while now CDs (digitals) only allow them to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while flying, and the travel it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the communication policy and techniques are back to horse cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret of the embassies.
It is now the embassies who request confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France bidouille its promises of financing
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the implementation of the promises of rapidly unblocked funding (such fast start or early funding) made by developed countries.
And the big French biduillages are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (or 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU came out the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation is valuable and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released ‚Ç¨2.2 billion in 2010, which sets it on the right track to meet its commitment of ‚Ç¨7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must, according to the Copenhagen agreement, be "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being to the detriment of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the best reference.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France believes that funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or at the overall level of official development assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of France's support for developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element is the division between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses his or her method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that 1‚Ç¨ loan equivalent to 1‚Ç¨ given.
Of course, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is necessary to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At the most, should be counted under its commitments only the cost of the loan for the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has no such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% of loans (EUR 380.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document to verify for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other cases) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1‚Ç¨ to meet its commitment, France only puts 10 cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
Nice pass-by tour!
In short, in its fast start financing, France operates a double swindling: on the one hand, on the evolution of action over time and on the reality of financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, she can make it believe that she spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with her promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has done the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely duped...
The chapter on early funding is only a small, relatively short-term issue compared to all climate discussions.
But it could be an extra sand grain in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that will not be the case.
In any event, it is essential to learn early funding from this first year.
First, France could announce a change in its way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of compliance with its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could move forward discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): one will not escape the question of "additionality" or the way in which loans are recorded.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would be of a kind to increase the level of international confidence needed to advance the discussions.
Child-ingested pesticides warning
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemical substances on a day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Generations Futures Association (former Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in relation to the low number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought food usually consumed in four meals and one incas in one day by a child of about ten years in the Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and September.
These typical meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as snacks, were examined by laboratories seeking chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as potential or probable carcinogens and five carcinogenic substances, some as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, we see in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrying," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven as certain carcinogens as well as about twenty residues that could disturb the hormone system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as incas from the study, presents traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenya's green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the steak, tuna box, and even the bread bag and chewing gum were full of pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the richest with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" "is probably underestimated", according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "face to the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "increasing civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
