The right-wing populists in Austria have a total of 29 percent
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the present great coalition, as well as a notable strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the current President Wilhelm Moltererer's position is seriously threatened, has suffered particularly serious losses.
On the other hand, the EU's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, prepares a triumphal return on the political stage at the national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political strength, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 per cent loses nearly nine per cent of the votes, has ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; in particular for the popular party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable advance on SPÖ.
The electors, however, chastised them visibly for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations about the possible resignation of the party leader and current vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were made.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday at the Party's Extraordinary Board of Management.
Such a development would facilitate the path towards the outcome of the most likely election, namely the renewal of the great SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free parties (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 per cent and BZÖ 11 per cent of the votes - the socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repetition in 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that BZÖ separated itself) on a common government, which even raised sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he was ready to collaborate with any party and that he planned to return to Vienna, on the national political stage, apparently put this development on.
The last party to have access to the parliament being the Greens, but the Greens slightly lost and returned, among the Austrian political parties, from the third in the fifth position.
Clearly, no other party exceeds the four percent limit and does not go to parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are likely to cool off
If the problem of Czech researchers indicted in India, accused of illegal cafard harvesting, could not be resolved, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister told him today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he observed after the meeting, following a Czech initiative.
Mr. Mukherjee said, in the course of talks, that the executive power could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was dismissed from the charge and punished by a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be resolved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could apply for bail and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms, that his partner expresses himself in the same way as during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be granted grace," said the chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide convicted persons with "competent legal support", the Indian minister mentioned.
He also said that such aid had already been provided to them by India.
"We wish above all to keep the best relations with India, which have a tradition continuing over many years.
The Indians also recognize him," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, he emphasized to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We consider the incarceration and prosecution of these Czech researchers as a great contempt," he said.
The Minister dismissed the question of whether he had obtained from India the promise to deal with the matter.
"I have already received quite a number of promises," he only observed.
An Arbitrary Czech Fight for the Seabed
It approaches an electronic wall map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosusso, who is part of the team of the thirty members of the UN division for ocean affairs and the law of the sea.
Its head, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The ardor at work and enthusiasm characterize the atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little known world so far, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found, but also living organisms for the time being unknown, which may contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A Background Wider Than Land
The coastal states have now begun to aspire vehemently to the new underwater territories.
According to a United Nations convention, they used their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental Shelf, which often extends to several hundred kilometres from the country's coast.
The latter may, according to the Convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental Shelf.
"To simplify, the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered as a continental Shelf.
It extends beyond the boundaries of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred thousand seas that represent the so-called exclusive economic one," Mikulka explains.
The request that the country in question submits to the Commission on the External Borders of the Continental Shelf should be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many expensive prospections and metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific and technical assistance.
To date, the Commission has dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
At the moment, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," adds Mikulka.
Australia's success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its underwater possessions, has recently experienced a global downturn.
New Zealand, too, has gained from the territory - the extent of the seabed, allocated to it by the commission last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometres, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefit they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they project, be invaluable.
Progressively, other countries will, in turn, submit their request.
They can do so within 10 years after they have ratified the "Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental Shelf ends, begins the area of the oceanic background, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no more State enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is conferred by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, we are not mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Director Mikulka exaggerating, stating that "these areas are clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states in the former L'Est bloc within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it obtained the status of the "a pioneer investor" under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states.
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area envisaged by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is enlivened, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract there on an extent with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," lists Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a realization.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical Shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The German special forces were in place for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had called for Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready but never proceeded to action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are being revealed.
According to the indications of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both federal army specialists and GSG 9 officials from the federal police airframe and the federal criminal police office, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk were at the point of release.
As the Ministry's spokesperson communicated it on Monday evening, the German forces were not finally required, the hostages who freed their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian Government would have accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate it on-site as a support force.
"It hasn't arrived so far," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of the Federal Interior.
The aggressors had kidnapped in southern Egypt the group of tourists composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages has so far remained vague, as have the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved are in the meantime arrived healthy and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the hostages released were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
No information was given in Berlin at the time on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five vacationers and special forces should have taken off an Airbus from the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives refuses the rescue plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has recently failed the $700 billion heavy financial market rescue plan.
The Dow Jones was clogging in the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the rescue plan for the government's financial markets.
Despite all the calls made by U.S. President George W. Bush and the political men at the head of the two parties, the program that was supposed to be the chaos of the financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the partisans had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-founded plan of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debates, had called for a favourable vote, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he said.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones fucked more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of the investors that the state rescue plan could raise.
He returned shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of failure, fell again.
Experts are now planning new serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the approval and approval of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are required.
Organizers report a growing number of reservations
It should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
With regard to reservations for the next few months according to a study, the turnover increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the thirst for German travel remains unsatisfying in this study.
With regard to winter bookings, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period in the previous year, as entrusted in Berlin by the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV).
According to the GfK Market Research Institute's survey, increasing numbers of reservations already dominate in the fall months.
Thus, the sales figure would have risen to about 11 per cent compared to 2007 with the RDR.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyses the booking data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low dollar rate, travel to the USA would be particularly requested, the DVR stated.
There, the increase in reservations would amount to about a Third Party.
Apart from that, Spain, Turkey and Greece and our country would be especially sought after by the Germans.
Specially organized travel is requested, explained the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising energy and food prices, the costs would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individual trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with reductions in advance bookings or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very high so that an increase in sales figures will be re-registered compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Party
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuously, from beer in pitches to liter and celebrities in Tyrolean costumes of designer.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we don't have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV entertainer and wears a custom-cut Tyrolian costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves on us and fill their memory card - very flatter, and this on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a tourist at the beer festival and normally in the north of the Weißwurst equator, my feeling of well-being in the traditional costume has so far been limited.
But once on Thérèse Square, everything is half the worst.
Each or almost wears a tyrolian costume or leather pants; no one looks blasphemed or embarrassed - it's completely normal.
It's the only thing I've ever had in my Tyrolean costume to pick up a few odd eyes at the banana-chocó stand.
A Bavarian woman points out that I would have badly attached my tablar: "to the left means free, to the virgin middle, to the right, to the back of the widow."
Discreetly, I triple my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she says and laughs.
Others don't get so bad for these subtle flirt techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us their bare back-train without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first time to the beer party.
He finds it gorgeous, with an extended "oooooo".
He tells me all this after he's relieved of the cup he's been drinking before.
Directly next to this firemouth that everybody thinks is a garbage dump.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild pessors".
Others have no chance of getting rid of alcohol like that.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers run to the place of the party and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene rather in mutiny - always by four, they drag their cider covered with tents.
This works for most visitors of the beer party: we're going to empty it, we're going back full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the donkeys under the deck are not visible.
"These are the ones who can no longer swallow," one of the rescuers shouted in response to my question and then disappeared in the mix.
Accident victim identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon in town on Shenfield Road.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but then she died.
As a result of the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested for suspected dangerous conduct.
He's been released since, on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey was planning to join the European Union, the European powers were looking forward to entering its backcountry.
On the east side of Bosphora, 20 steps from Asia can be one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the guides tell us.
The monument is mounted at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation tower at each angle, such as some German provincial municipalities.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no further doubt as to the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retardant in the game of imperialism, wished to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway arriving in Damascus, Baghdad and has the most known land as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and the forces of the empire moved beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it's sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, swallowed up in the meanders of history.
But today, the rail crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to highlight the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a car-bed in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish MP AKP Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half journey, rocked on noisy rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital- presented as a new city of a new century state, turning its back to its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, in particular Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra modern structure, specifically built in stone and steel, in a developing district, surrounded by half-built shopping centres and numerous pastries in which middle managers in men and women-cravate costumes meet for morning business.
Suat Kinikioglu could have been a right-centre politician from any other party in Europe.
Dress, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"The aim of this foreign policy is to now reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
That wasn't the case with each other.
She had to do both.
"but, at some point, "I asked if" Turkey should not choose?"
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out an aspect that almost all those I could talk to, I was told by heart: The Turkish railway is not only going to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to draw a metaphorically travelling Europe on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the station in Hydarpasha, after another night without sleeping, I thought of these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that European ambitions in the Middle East could largely be in the hands of Turkey.
As I waited at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphore, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been called "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memories by Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11th) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already starting from his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic choir of young people, Proteus.
The choir was to include those under 21 years of age, but before Proteus could not sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old- refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the desire and ability of the choir to manage any type of music presented to it, whether Madrid or Messianique.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remains constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod told us to "let music speak for itself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants"
It's all there, in the music.
So sing!"
His rod technique was absolutely clear, precise, even though never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it a lot higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named a knight, that's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them has ever disappointed me, and sometimes they even inspired me.
Tod Handley owned such a rare combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his view, "focus only on certain people".
Many of us will be missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary by William Woodruff (died September 25th) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history, in Oxford, and became a member of Hoblon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSc, MA and a PhD".
This is from the letter of the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but this is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor in economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time finished a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Houblon, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to conceal this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "the Flamenco and life " because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have drawn my attention to their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with much respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda's Super Sales
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new mono volume has an even wider interior space.
In addition to this are some refined mechanics, which increase the comfort of driving and save more gasoline.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz presents a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this mono volume are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it should be emphasized that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation is put on the market.
First of all, it is observed that Honda has renovated this model within a shorter time limit than that of the other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less well known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case with Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with about one million cars sold in six years, represents the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow him to increase his sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it thought of selling 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002 which accounts for 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
Spanish branch officials hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to tackle largely the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand leaders hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% decrease in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Content and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is planned in the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 metres (five centimeters in excess), its width is 1.69 metres (two centimeters in excess) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 metres, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change to 1.52 meters.
Dimensions increase and interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a reserve of petrol in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the capacity of the chest - which has a double background system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of capacity in addition to the chest of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or panoramic roof - is improving access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, part relative to the back doors of the first Jazz that would open with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two gasoline propellers of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first engine 1.2 litres develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 tr/min and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 tr/min.
This propeller - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a gasoline consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propeller, which over the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reached 100 horses.
This 100-horse Honda Jazz 1.4L has combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that, by imitating the theft of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Advanced Technical Centre at Nissan Motor Co. made this little robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan Security Shield.
This robot will allow the brand's vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee created its own personal space of an oval shape that looks much like the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important is the compound eyes of the bee, able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to steal without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects the obstacles that are within a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"When he detects an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by forging his wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is totally instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Travel Laboratory and Senior Engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
" Each second of this device must only process information and act according to that data.
It does not need to retain the information or intuitive logics of prior manoeuvres, that is why it can operate continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we are not talking about giga-bytes of memory, not even mega-bytes."
This represents the first because of the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced into the series cars in about ten years after Nissan.
The robot runs with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid to be mortgaged.
It must be recognized that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without engineering.
Faced with the crisis, and in order to prevent the Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to fail: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is 'the Hotel of Bad Credits' ... or stories.
The ugly aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Master of the Hotel leads us to think on several occasions if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is certain that this game gives useful but little detailed information.
It's more of a youth game.
What if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens its capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entrance to his turn table at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new one welcomes by a sharp decline in its scholarship course.
One week after revealing an interim agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9 per cent of Morgan Stanley's shares at a unit price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The price charged is below 19% of the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a 10% return with a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall operation would be based on an average unit price of 29 dollars, or 28% above its current course.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% to $23.07 around 5.00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," said John Mack, the director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but put it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares in Japan for approximately $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, he explained to Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the Executive Director of MUFG, "we hope that participation will be entirely made up of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation in the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover us."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its securities Morgan Stanley 7% below their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares if they exchange more than 50% above the conversion price, or approximately 47 dollars, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, a group spokesperson refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to display a Tier One solver ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that he had "directly" eased his balance sheet since late August.
The last few weeks have been proving for the group, who saw his scholarship course melt half while the cost of insurance against a risk of default on his debt was flying.
This cost was Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the large investment banks in Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa to Quito this Monday.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, was the third one to put a draft new Constitution to the vote.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls were conducted at the exit of polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a large "yes" win, between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday to Monday.
The "Constitution has triumphed dramatically", he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the seat of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales as well as his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place in calm according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, focused on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the State over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country which is essentially living from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign foreign currency sent by its emigrants.
Carryed by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive mandates of four years and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it would use this power and fight a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in that country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as the starting point for US anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commander launched the assault on the captors of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back this Monday afternoon healthy and except in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived about 330 hours on board a special aircraft at the military base of al-Maza, hosted at the International Airport of Cairo.
They were transferred immediately, without being able to speak to the press, on board helicopters to Maadi Hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in "good health," and "no ransom has been paid" to the captors," said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoeir Garanna on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 at a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been cast from one cache to another by 35 unknown captors.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptus agency, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 Special Forces members, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of shots occurred, and half of the raptors were killed, the others fled," said this manager who required anonymity.
He indicated that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "Eclair" unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commanders.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where it is located, the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men of secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on whose side were the captors, killing in six, including the Chadian chief, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-United Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which this movement immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place and is taking place in this election campaign.
All the better.
But an area of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the amount of misery that is granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are hungry?
Which politician would dare remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have any real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government devote three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Quebec's History Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers are grouped into 211 societies of history, heritage, archival and genealogy, and care to search history, to preserve with three individuals under the heaps of private archives and to preserve archaeological remains.
They are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
To when, a rostrum for history and heritage?
The Benelux governments nationalize part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Hollanda bank, as the first European banking institution in distress as a result of the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, and partly nationalising it. The three countries are supporting this financial and insurance institution, which also has interests in Hungary, at an amount of EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also using the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been expanding for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view, the decisions to be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy nearly half (49%) of the bank's capital in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell part of its stakes, including, first of all, activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
Last week, the Fortis shares started a vertigo drop. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to be allowed to go bankrupt.
Only Friday, the company's shares fell by 12 percent, reaching its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, shares have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the present value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the leaders of society, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the uncertainty of overseas, in connection with the adoption of the US rescue plan of $700 billion, of being the cause of the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, paper has already received a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as new CEO.
The financial body was also looking for private buyers, but had not yet received a substantive proposal.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not be concerned, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's clientele circle and no agency was attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also purchased lease companies.
A fox in the chicken
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate on the basis of information on their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that link the use of information concerning the prescription of medicinal products, in all cases, to the agreement of the person concerned.
This type of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is to entrust its chicken to a fox" - recalled Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage the prescriptions of drugs, in Washington Post.
Insurance companies rely on insurance premiums and insured capital in the event of damage, the customer's health status, and if they feel that the risk is too great, they do not even secure it.
In the past, they sent candidates to medical examinations, and they signed insurance contracts with them only after they learned of the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, he provides himself easily at the pharmacy, the data concerning the purchase of drugs from the person within the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines himself, what disease the person is suffering and what his health is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high rate of fat in the blood, which immediately puts it in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk factor, so there is nothing left to do to the insurer other than the paperwork. However, small problems may still arise.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or against heat sprays, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in data research and analysis, and they must seek permission from the patient before collecting necessary information from the pharmacy.
They are now under pressure from the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their past failures.
In recent years, some companies have also been dealing with the results of laboratory analyses, linking them with the data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill on the extension of the control circle of authorities concerning companies specializing in the supply of data is currently before the Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her agreement or not, since if he or she refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with her.
Thus and finally, hens depend on the goodness of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are multiplying their trade by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other, largely global problems.
Today, there will also be a summit in France-India, where cooperation on atomic energy will be the main issue.
The European Union recognizes that India is a great emerging democratic power to which a broader right of speech should be given in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet succeeded in agreeing on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not focus too much on this issue yesterday at the 9th summit in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, like the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they were going to multiply trade by two, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be too ambitious.
In this regard, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civil flights, and in this way air trade can also expand in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only ninth among EU partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and there was an urgent need to hold a United Nations conference on this issue.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been requested, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic materials by at least twenty per cent by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the need for a global market to be made at the next year's climate conference, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent the rise in food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State is now visiting the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to press agency information, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Salon with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition, and Turkey as guest of honour.
It will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Property and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government during the Italian Papillon opening ceremony: Italy will be present institutionally, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by an appointment with the press in the Room Struktur, at the butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign books is gradually decreasing compared to the total Italian production, and in particular to that for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying on the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at 3000 metres above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, at the border between California and Nevada.
Within the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County's sheriff, John Anderson, told us the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it's very much the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found on or around the plane.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered deceased .
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreck survey, a team of investigators sent to the scene, identified the aircraft: this is the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal effects were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, species money and a sweater.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he had become in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks in solitary flight.
Three years later, he toured the world by plane and without stop.
Of all these records, also that of having stolen at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect.
A 4x4 out of the common of a well-defined original design, marked lines, wide surfaces and net angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk, the last born of the off road "compacts" of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a fresh air in this sector.
Just by its non-standard, unexpected and non-conventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showroom, starting on October 17.
Thus the advertising campaign that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of the shopping Milanese, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, we will have the impression that by looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elisa8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is clear that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future buyers? We'll see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy has now become ashamed? They are part of the Ultras Italy group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, to date, has never created major problems.
Never had a fight with adverse typhoids.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (little in reality) of Campania and Puglia have been added.
They had three-coloured flags on which their original city appeared: Saturday evening, they were all removed to avoid being identified.
They are inspired by the English typhosserie.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhosserie of true Nazis, that of Levski.
Figc had made available Italian fans, 144 tickets for the party: all nominal, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had all of them controlled: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to go to a stadium.
Four Italian typhosis who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not travel.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will happen from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, it may be that the typhosis arrested or identified in the disorder purge a Daspo for at least five years .
An international Daspo who forbids to go to Italian but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer walk to the stadium.
Gladly.
But now it is time for fear-emulsion: that is, others are likely to add to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must extinguish this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," the Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes wide open especially in view of the national team match from Wednesday to Lecce"
In the Puglia there is indeed a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets on Tuesday, the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Aise, i.e. secret services, which are precisely dealing with stage problems.
"Duce-Duce Hearts, and the arm stretched during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzelli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzelli was formerly a prefect in Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzelli said, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 typhosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - added the Observatory No. 1 - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in the rules, now we'll see what happened, and we'll evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about whistles to Mameli's anthem: those too are not crimes, but if you will allow me, they are not police..."
