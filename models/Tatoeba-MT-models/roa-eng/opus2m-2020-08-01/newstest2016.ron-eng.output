UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the conflict that lasts for almost five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN head again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a conference on Wednesday that he intends to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present at the Council - the United States, Russia, China, England and France - on the margins of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this an unresolved situation."
Ban asked the five permanent members to demonstrate solidarity and unity when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 digits of polls showing Donald Trump's real chance
Some tried to label him as a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to shoot Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have shown that Donald Trump is driving with a percentage of two digits and some voices are beginning to seriously wonder what this means for the chances of naming the real estate mogul.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for Republican Nomination.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance replaced Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would fight hard at the general elections are numerous.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and economic conservative group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
Here are a few figures from recent surveys that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing thing:
The figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion on the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage rose to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion on Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A survey carried out last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the republicans in the region have a favorable opinion on Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the race for nomination.
In a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be "enthusiasms" or "thanks" if Trump won the race for nomination.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "sung" if Trump won the race for nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% said he would be “enthusiastic” compared to 40% who said the same thing about Trump).
The closest to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters claim that they would be “unsatisfied” or “suffered” if Jeb Bush’s favorite wins the race for nomination.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temper is a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticized for the insults brought and his bomb style, 52% of Republican voters at the national level believe that the real estate mogul has the right temper to be president, according to the poll carried out on Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We have the same figures in Iowa, where 52% of the Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be the leader, according to the survey carried out last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% are of the opinion that he does not have the personality needed to act effectively and almost six out of 10 independents state that his temperament does not have what he is looking for in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to the idea.
When I take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, to the question who has the most chance to win the race for GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed over the end of July, when four out of ten would bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: In the past, GOP voters did not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last elections, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or replicated to another candidate, Trump is still in front of everyone.
Some voices say that the divided situation will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while the support against Trump will be shared to more than twelve candidates.
However, a survey conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush, and finally 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical one-to-one confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've decided.
A new survey conducted on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of Trump's supporters say they don't change their voting option.
Obviously, many can happen in this sense and no one can say that they will ever change their mind.
46% says it leaves the door open to change its option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it is twice as likely that voters who declare that they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say I agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violators" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration was the central issue in the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump's bomb style will lead to a split between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will harm rebranding efforts.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as the immigration problem remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration to authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to the survey conducted on Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone experienced in government.
People are also angry at the Washington authorities.
A survey carried out two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the benefit of the republicans in Congres, 54% declaring themselves "unhappy" and 21% "nerves at the top".
Jeremy Corbyn debuts at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, confronting David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be closely analyzed by the media and Labour MPs.
During the weekly appearances, he asked for “less theatre and more facts”.
He also said he could give up a few participations and give up his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbyn's first parliamentary test in the leadership position, coming after he called a "ghost cabinet" and after his speech on Tuesday at the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the leader of the Labour Party to remain silent at the end of the national anthem in a job held Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England drew criticism from conservative parliamentarians and kept the front page of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he "kept silence respectfully" and recognized "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of the ghost cabinet of Mr. Corbyn, Owen Smith, said for the broadcast Two's Newsnight submitted by the BBC that he would have recommended to the Labour leader to sing the "no matter" national anthem of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr. Corbyn's lead team, arguing by differences of opinion regarding the economy, defence and external, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
The political correspondent for the BBC, Robin Brant, says that the political differences are "compulsive" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment of his position towards the European Union and the benefit limit.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would eliminate the idea of limitation in full.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that the party "is very clear" in the exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce "head" from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader confronted by David Cameron at the rostrum in the last decade, since he took over the Conservative Party.
The Labour Leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from external sources" for questions to be addressed to Lord Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentarian Islington North said that PMQs involves a level of confrontation too high and that it will refrain from replicas and attacks, committed to focusing instead on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Finance, will take his place at PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr. Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the occasional floor, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" associated with PMQs often, but he acknowledged a few years later that he failed in his approach.
Since the first transmission, in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of the reasoning of a leader, the way he leads the Chamber of Deputies and its position among parliamentary colleagues, although critics say it has become a cartoon and that he needs a thorough reform.
"Fair in Joburg": Uninhabited young people benefit from photo courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a trade and earn their living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the areas where they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says that higher wages could damage enlargement
President J.D. Sports, Peter Cowgill, said a minimum wage increase in Britain could mean "a higher purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, it is unlikely that that purchasing power will exceed the higher labour costs for the firm, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean less new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis should be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the storm created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves more than words of praise and not criticism, in the opinion of President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was dragged unfortunately into the spotlight by the scandalous landing that Kyrgios had in front of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters Tournament.
In a qualifying crescent game played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the arbitrator had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have put Kyrgios to the ground, and I should have put him to the ground on this kid."
Although he was last seen making a dust rocket after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is fighting Sam Groth for second place in the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the semifinal Davis Cup against England.
"One thing I feel strong is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was attracted to the conflict," Healy said.
The truth is, he broke a missile when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of it.
But to be serious, he has mastered himself extremely well in rather challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of confidence.
He's got an amazing team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and he's integrated into the team, he hasn't had any conflict with the other players, he's highly respected in the locker room, he's trained hard, he's in an excellent way, he's a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged exclusively on his qualities and faults.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important game of remission, which starts on Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most suitable for all, but supported the return of the original player from Canberra in the long term on the team.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the fight and not think at all about the controversy around him [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick went up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he's growing up under the eyes of the public and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think he needs a time when he's not at the centre of attention to be able to reflect, which is good for both the team and for him.
2016 elections: Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Bernie Sanders has halved in national surveys
Former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins the field.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is second, 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not announced yet that he will be running for the presidency, is supported by 15% of the democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, the majority of Democrats say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more staunch in their choice than other candidates.
Faced with the CBS news poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and the moderates, but the advantage has declined.
Support among men has decreased considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among Democrats under the age of 50 has evaporated, being now equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in the forefront of senior voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two figures, among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5 point advantage in this group.
About half of the democratic voters at the national level say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if he were chosen to run for the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it only because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood of Clinton's current supporters being enthusiastic about her choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who don't currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her with enthusiasm.
While 48% of the Democrats say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same thing about the first class, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility are also mentioned.
Given that the vice-president takes into account a possible candidacy for the presidency, 57% of the Democrats would like to see him in the race - although a third of them do not think they should run.
On the second option for the party's representative, democratic voters call Biden the majority.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half affirms that Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic Party race, the advantage of Hillary Clinton in front of Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden running to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of Democrat voters consider Clinton the most likely candidate to win the general election, but the figures dropped from 78% last month.
Biden is in second place, but the percentage according to which he is most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to a candidate chosen, democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these electors to be unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.
Democrat candidates or potential candidates are doing well in some key features of their party's primary voters.
Most of the voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and trustful and strong leaders.
Biden is seen best of all three as regards integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of Democrat voters do not believe that H. Clinton is integrity and reliable, twice as many as those who declare this about Sanders (15%) but 27% do not have an opinion about him in this regard.
Democrat voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
Regarding all these aspects, about a quarter of the Democrats don't have an opinion on Sanders.
How the questions persist regarding the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton while he was Secretary of State, most of the Democrats are satisfied with his explanation of the subject and say that he did not affect their general opinion with respect to the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third of them are satisfied.
The public opinion was divided in March on this subject shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say that the e-mail controversy has not affected their general opinion about Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion negatively.
Most Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their view of Clinton in the negative sense.
While Democrats consider Clinton to be an integral and reliable candidate, this aspect continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% consider her to be an integral and reliable one, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of the voters do not consider her integrity and trust.
At the same time, 55% of national voters do not consider Trump to be sound and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush are first classified with regard to integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders to be integral is greater than those who are not of the same opinion, but, as in Carson's case, many do not have an opinion on him.
The error margin for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the fraternal accused of killing the student in year 1 of Baruch College
Almost two years after a college student lost his life during a initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity of New York's Baruch College brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, put a 14 kg bag full of sand behind her back and was repeatedly shaken while trying to head towards a target on a frozen field.
Mr. Deng accused headaches after losing consciousness.
Brother Pi Delta Psi didn't call the emergency number after he passed out and pretended he'd waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, the police said.
But they found the time to change Deng's clothes, to look for his symptoms on Google and to contact Andy Meng, the president of the national fraternity, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide personal property and put practically the good of the fraternal before the good of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated head, trunk and thigh trauma.
"Many families have been devastated by fraternal rituals, since 1970 at least one student lost his life every year because of rituals," Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, said in a statement.
Their siblings and members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The grand jury of Monroe district recommended that the first five members be charged with murder by grade three.
Another thirty-two members of the fraternity, including Mr Meng, will also be charged for outrage and complicity in murder.
"We want to take responsibility not only for the people involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the fraternity, official or unofficial, we will also take responsibility," Wagner said Tuesday at a press conference.
The Baruch faculty banned the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local representative.
Here's what happens when the Federal Reserve increases the interest rate
The interest rate will increase and the bull market (growing market) will shrink, the profitability of bonds will increase and the economy will enter the recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will happen and how long it will take.
In the economy, history offers few clues about time frame..
After the first increase in interest rates, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how economy and financial assets respond.
For this reason, US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on the time when interest rates begin to rise but on the trajectory of normalisation time.
Indeed, in the game are multiple variables.
However, in the end, market players could find that all the turmoil related to the growth of the interest rate has been overstated.
"The first increase in the interest rate decided by Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the "cheap banks" era," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels but still small to constitute the seismic shock that all seem to be afraid of.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Here is how some sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
In view of the situation that the market has faced in recent months, the anticipation of the growth of the interest rate may temporarily undermine things.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a tendency that the profitability of capital will stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may reflect the gap in monetary policy again," analysts Deutsche Bank said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed increases.
More precisely, in the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - about 14 percent - towards the growth of the interest rate, quite invariable over the period 250 days after (average climb of 2.6 percent) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the head of the Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said that the impact on shares tends to become pronounced later in the growth cycle of the interest rate and the benefits begin to decline.
The recession is a reality of economic life but the growth of the interest rate often contributes to it.
In the present situation, Fed faces conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in the Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few are expected to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increasing interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if it is different this time," Deutsche said.
The players on the market have been prepared all year round for an increase decision by the Fed, all eyes being alerted to this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends Thursday.
Although many strategies and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in the interest rate at this meeting, long-term transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study since 1950, all growth cycles of the interest rate so far have been in a super profit growth cycle, GDP eclipsed the peaks before the recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report said.
On the other hand, this was a strange slow recovery after the worst recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by Fed since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster for bonds than for shares when Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, the benefits seem to change direction as soon as the first growth/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, bond profitability decreases immediately," Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategies are of the opinion that these increases in the interest rate will lead to the approximation of profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-efficiency bonds work better in such an environment, although "we are still careful about the strengthening of profitability," said Kathy Jones, an analyst on fixed income in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"In addition to the power of the dollar and the decline in inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the return curve is fairer, the spread of the average interest rate of credit has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when Fed enhances policy.
In large lines, the companies that carry out their majority activity in the United States will have to gain from the growth of the interest rate and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will have to suffer because the increase of the dollar will lead to the expense of their products in the global market area and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that "quality" stocks tend to be more profitable within the next three months of an initial growth in the interest rate," analyst Goldman Sachs said in a customer report.
Strong balance sheets exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital revenues as well as low volatility stocks have also exceeded similar companies of lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentual points) and 3 (percentual points) respectively.
The debt will become an important problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also have earned from the increase of the dollar.
Those who save could also have won, although experts do not agree on how fast this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, says parliamentary Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for "protesting"
He claims to be increasingly similar to the commercial opponent
He also took a look at BBC Music Awards, claiming that they plagiarized Brits awards
Damien Collins' colleague attacked The Voice, claiming that neither this show was original
BBC Radio 3 is "transforming into" Classic FM, said an important parliamentary, putting pressure on it to prove that it does something that commercial posts don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public radio station is "protesting" and looks more and more like the commercial opponent.
"I have the impression that Radio 3 is "crazy" - although I don't like to use the word - but I feel like it's turning into the Classic FM," he said.
He also took a look at BBC Music Awards, released last year in December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seem to be Brits under another name.
So, if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that they just copy what already exists on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC Director General denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent in the live music and public education.
I'm not gonna find out anywhere about classical music from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important that Radio 3 is committed to discover new music and the allocation of new songs," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3, editor Alan Davey said that he needs to make more efforts to attract the audience than before because the British have less knowledge about classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the name BBC criticised at the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport because it would go after its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show purchased by BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for about £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that issue because it is not original and does not distinguish itself by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that BBC1 - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - be performed "in a specific way BBC."
He added that he wants that Corporation to “find the golden egg hen in his own dislike” next time he launches a entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban future takeover of new seasons in The Voice or spend money going on licenses on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales recorded the smallest increase in August and guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
In the last month, the slowest increase has been in 2000 to date.
Online sales took on three years ago, thanks to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Specialists are of the opinion that Black Friday in November could lead to reluctance to expenditure.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned Britain's commercial streets into ghost cities.
Experts say, however, that there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the last figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total money spent in August showed the lowest increase from 2000 to now, with only 5% increase in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, the last figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we look at the level of growth in previous years and return until 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize time," Andy Mulcahy, editor at the IMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that online sales were advanced three years ago, when buyers began using their mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do it in different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that you are stagnating a little, you may notice a decrease (increase).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
In the opinion of experts, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event taking place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers piled up in front of computers to put their hands on offers, which led to the collapse of several retail sites.
Experts are of the opinion that Black Friday, when buyers have beaten their groceries, could determine the reluctance of buyers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least £1 of every £5 is spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are currently being made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to call on fashion shops in commercial areas.
Following the punishment of the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed following the crash of the macarale in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked the streets of Muslims, the first funeral held in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partly blamed the giant in Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
Minister of Health said that 394 people were injured following the crash of the crane
At the street walk ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a crane collapsed at the Great Mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who mourned the dead joined the road to express their condolences, until the first death came to the end of the final journey, at the Al-Moussem cemetery.
The sad reminder preserved by the holy place, where only a few days ago a crane of construction collapsed through the mosque ceiling, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the Bin Laden family's construction group for the disaster, which also soldiered with 394 wounded.
At the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a crane collapsed at the Great Mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, in his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims still arriving in town.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the arm of the crane high when the crane was not working.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group bears partial blame for the collapse.
The English news agency service did not present that detail, but said that the company’s leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the crash of the crane in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Hajj pilgrimage that took place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements on the collapse of the crane and the representatives of the Group could not be contacted for the declarations.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using updated safety measures and did not coordinate its activities with the meteorological authorities.
Tens of cranes surround the Great Mosque in Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and conducts major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegade" son, dismembered by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in strong wind and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in the life of each Muslim fit physical.
Authorities state that 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities decided that the relatives of the deceased would receive a million Saudi Riali (174,000 pounds) and that the same amount would be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
Benefits and disadvantages of converting loans into Swiss francs
There have already been two bids on the banking market to convert loans into Swiss francs into lei, with the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years when the interest variable can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transylvania has just completed the process of converting credits into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer to its customers.
According to data gathered by analysts of FinZoom Financial Portal, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest to lei, 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the Transylvania Bank conversion offer was accepted by 83% of customers with credits in francs due to the second successive reductions: the balance with the value of risk commissions and client-paid administration was reduced, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the lei balance.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to the monthly payment equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bancpost, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the cover in lei of credits in CHF is to eliminate the currency risk, the consumer being protected by future franc growth, and the repayment of the loan will be made in the currency in which they earn their salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that no reassessment of the property is made, no additional guarantees are required and another proof of income is required.
Technically, no new financial and legal analysis of the credit will be carried out and no additional costs will be made in the event of a restructuring.
Both banks also offer a reduction in the monthly rate, compared to what customers were paying before conversion, equivalent to lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first few years is more of the interest, and the customer repays very little of the main.
The bankpost offer with very small interest in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
He doesn't know how this interest will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be more than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is smaller.
A possible risk for all variable interest lei credits is that the ROBOR index grows significantly in the following years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, three-month ROBOR is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6%, in 2009, over 15%, and in a few days in 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to provide other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come for decisions on the rate of interest for the US Federal Reserve
The world looks at the meeting scheduled for two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether to increase or not the rate of interest for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, a little over half that last week believed that the decision would be taken, I now believe that the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates will be retained in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are faced with a situation where a major central bank could give up the zero rate and initiate a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, recovering by bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
However, the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned the markets to prepare for an increase but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Sees that have lost their charm
The actor (left) alongside his son Redmond (right) has been through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 she struggled with leukemia and in 2009 she lost her partner in a life, Farrah Fawcett, in the face of cancer.
It is also alleged that the actor would have faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this is definitely costing.
Player Luke Shaw from Manchester United is on the line for a few months because of double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg in the game played by Manchester United in the Champions League, ended with a defeat in front of PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and that will keep him out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred following a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after Shaw, 20 years of age, broke the PSV defense.
He got medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double leg fracture and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the next day he'll be operated in Manchester.
It's awful -- a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, he's having trouble, then he's playing fantastic and now something like that happens.
He's got his oxygen mask in the locker room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but at double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
It seems that Moreno got lucky and escaped the red card and the consent of a penalty shot.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge yourself when I say it's fault and red card.
It was a very ugly, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: “Thank you all for messages, I don't have words to express how weak I am, I start my way to recovery, I'll come back stronger.”
Similar news: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's accident in defeat of PSV
The founder of England's team has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Coco, PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad accident."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players never aim to accident an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico national against the Dutch national led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very hard for him because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious accident, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the stage.
I could only see the ball, which was headed in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In his statement for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how difficult it is to go through such things.
I feel really bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's omission, but it's still holding tight.
Victoria v. Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after we have seen the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not consider a repetition of defeat by 3-0 in the test games.
I wouldn't eliminate any variant of a moving victory.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good spin players in the line of beating and collective morality is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive youthful attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth left England's team for test games and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his principal coach in Yorkshire, I find it difficult to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven test matches against two good attackers in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged after the results.
There were no questions about Joe Root, for example, until the ads were made because - and I said that before - players are their own pickers.
Some fifty years and perhaps Lyth would have extended his run, but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope that if he does more runs for Yorkshire, he will have other opportunities.
The senior coach of England's team, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance was not to the extent of his capacity and I am not surprised by this; first of all, he is a teamman.
It is difficult to answer the question as long as a batsman is noted in the test games.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton got lucky at home and on the move.
The only discontent you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the tournament in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in full shape - but that missed occasion is in the past.
Alex Hales, a batsman I'm counting very well on, is coming on the team.
He's a cricket player who has the "X factor" and I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as before, but this will depend of course on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched that Moeen would open up next to Cook, which would lead to extra spinner keeping at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a shooter couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already shown that he's fucked up.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success in his district, Worcestershire, but it was number 3 for them, so the difference isn't great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test games 38 as first drop before entering open in 2001.
He deleted immediately three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes on the team back-up spinner and, although I had limited contact with him, he hit me that he's a very impressive young man.
People could judge his age - with an average of 31 at the fight and 35 at the ball - and they might think it's a point, but there's not a lot of spinners and the selections opted for the youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has made a few changes to the coach team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master shot.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, since he has played in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white-ball league of the tournament and will bring both energy and unbridled ambition.
I always thought she was born to get involved in the international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, she has intuition.
Sometimes the new voices in the locker room, even if they send messages that have been transmitted and previously, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's teammate, Ben Stokes rests for the one-day games, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.
Although they are not all in agreement, coaches and selectionists do not do the program.
And you have to retain, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
Camp Brexit could have earned the cause if the economy remained in the heat by 2017
The day after, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to maintain Britain in the EU is becoming more and more confused, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Yes or no?" Corbyn in the leadership of the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism to Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained in recent days that - sunk in crises similar to that in the EU - not all being provoked internally - some Member States are fed on the agenda of the Great Britain's concessions and amendments to the Treaties, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that they did not want this either if it erodes social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor take part in bilateral foreign capital summits or sessions, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain with a perspective outside the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that several ministers and officials who get from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German Chancellor, is an ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation goes back, as happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been too much.
In 2017, France's President, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain one on the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - a thing they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to make intentional remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, suggests my friend.
‘Renegotiation has been fixed’ and ‘The UK has not obtained any value from the renegotiation’.
Europeans know on their skin how captors Fleet Street can be and how sceptics are barons of the oligarchic press that look at the EU with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in the 2:1 report.
He may recall vaguely the euro-opportunist Boris Johnson, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was Correspondent in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mixture of tax-dischargers, foreigners who were phone fraud and pseudo non-domies who own most of the important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair sees them the same way, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from thinking about eating lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of referendum, given that Blair agreed on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me on the back months at Westminster - I told him not to spend his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting Neil Kinnock's Murdoch boycott's boycott strategy from the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left a Sunday vacation.
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call evolution indulgence.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with conservative "anglicism" might agree with that.
That said Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the researcher in him fought not to acknowledge that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as minister "of shadow" on financial matters was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his fellow workers, without going too far and without losing his office in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not match what McDonnell said and what JC told colleagues and parliamentarians at the private meeting on Monday night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey - you hold me back, it has made me aware - the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television and especially in the rotation of social networks, a focus of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a ticket of favor in Europe, allowing him to take the support of the workers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbeiro's basic sophistication of EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in the case of his NATO sophism - Tom Watson is undisputed that JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed about the weak military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that cuts costs, as I was reminded of the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticise the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of them related to tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of evidence."
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to the links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in Lancet's medical journal attacked the "extraordinary fragile base" that founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers in BMJ questioned their claims and reasoned “on solid ground or moving sand”.
Martin McKee, European public health professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that PHE claims that “current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking” are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, only one meeting involving 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) that synthesized their views on the negative effects associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, about which executive director was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past for an independent study.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting said the funding received from an electronic cigarette producer but not the funding that there are reports that they would have received it from the tobacco and tobacco producer Philip Morris International.
No arguments were provided on the basis of which the panel members were selected, but they include a number of known ‘problems’ in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of which even declare in the work of the industry financing.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the Chief of the Tobacco Control Section of the PHE.
The research work developed by the group "musquelizes convincingly" the lack of "solid evidence on the harmful effect of most products according to most criteria", said McKee and Capewell.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell stated that PHE claims that “to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the PHE health department, said he had responded in the past to the BMJ claims.
He said: “Electronic complaints are significantly less harmful than smoking”
One out of two people who have been smoking all their lives is losing their lives because of this addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the risk of electronic cigarettes to health is lower compared, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about information that arises and those that does not arise from evidence, in particular given the high degree of public confusion regarding the dangers relative to tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a smoking-related disease and the annual costs incurred by the national health system due to smoking reach £2 billion.
Clearly expressing the current evidence - namely that while the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risks, they only present a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfill our national duty.

Britain's arms trade is disgraced by advertisements
Follow the film by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
Drone awful killers!
Beasts to crush your ankles!
Dispersion bombs!
And electric sticks that cause terrifying pain without leaving any trace!
The cheering voice and animated images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms trade is an open grid, made by Amnesty International to underline the British authorities' desire to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCel Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus stations and metros that need a second look.
"Major announcement, travel with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London metro, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will be forced on DLR Customers are asked to contribute to the cessation of the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-pound Allen package that says "facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in the world's bus stations."
The London transport director is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of steering wheels.
One of the parody announcements produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists ask more and more questions and seek to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are heading for collaboration with activists on protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against arms trade that welcomes shuttles traveling by metro.
The film made by Amnesty had over 100,000 Facebook views in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and the artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
The creation director of the VCCP, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the advertisement for the arms trade - with an empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the realization of a more realistic advertisement, but "enriching it with strong animations and colors, it was more exciting".
"They did a great job of helping us increase our interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered at the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the theme of the arms trade comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order received from the U.S. Army on "AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher."
It includes “a single-shaped focus that gives amazing effects behind the armor inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules to live in the home
It's been 11 years since I moved to my home, while I was a 19-year-old who still believed in beers and moral relativity, but I can hardly remember the loud smiles of those who were angry - and the many complaints to others.
Most of the things I've learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can bring states that vary from nerve to horror.
Spokenness is tempting: to tell people where you're from, if and where you've spent a year of study break, what you think about Corbyn, and why "sincerely, it's no matter Marmite because, really, you guys, it's nothing but hahaha dredging extract, you find me in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others breathe - ask questions and show interest.
These encourage the conversation and help you differentiate people you like from those you haven't talked to even if the flood came and they would be the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Sleepers often abound with drinks, movies and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress and taste their underwear.

Introverts have special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a refuge, but in many homes you build a dorm culture, based on friendship, socialization and friends that last your whole life.
All this can be terrible for someone who's trying to load their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say "I like you and I want you to remain friends but I want you to go away to regain the energy I've consumed by interacting with you."
Try to sit down when a colleague is exhausted from socializing - and try sending a text instead of knocking on the door.
Speaking of knock at the door: do it.
A guy who was sitting in the same house with me had a policy saying that if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited in.
He's seen enough things.
Make friends by cooking.
Since you start college in Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to meet and take a black plate, it seems less strange, less like the situation in the 1950s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I cooked something, now smiles and I ask personal questions."
Goodness prepared in the house is a great way to make you friends.
Your roommates will feel compelled to talk and may end up associating your figure with a pleasant surprise.
Obviously, you must be a good cook.
Plums of flour, sugar and fat will most likely cause others to pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing is a common crime in student homes.
Obviously, if you wipe somebody's chicken is stolen, but if you take a drop of milk to put yourself in tea is still stolen?
Ask the owner.
He'll probably tell you to serve even if it's boiling on the inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and I understand you - still try to address the matter more mature than my roommate, who has colored his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who have stolen.
He's in jail now.
Do not make noise that does not let others sleep or study.
That's not just because it's good sense, it's because you're going on your own.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to give the music slower because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to give the music stronger.
When they finally stopped the music at 5 a.m., the girl was nice and let her sleep two hours before giving the music maximum, locked the door and went to the exam that lasted three hours.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband/visitor wife would move on the same level?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely strange if you were to confuse a partner with your future husband, you would hook up, you would split up and you should meet him every day and maybe even see him catch up with all your common friends?
Of course, you can't resist the heart - but if a sexy roommate certainly isn't your future husband, try to be rational at least.
The moment you realize that someone has left their keys in the locked room, the line between farce and intimidation is thinner than it seems.
A successful prank is funny, but it can denture in a few moments.
Teach a fun and valuable lesson about safety by hiding something - but never soil someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but don't stick the goods to someone's ceiling more than twice.
Violinist David Grimal: There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as a solist but also as the initiator of a less common project, right "ciudad", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, which interprets a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, Sunday, in which the solist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one month, when in the foreground was the violinist Xavier Phillips, the works composed by Enescu were indisposed.
Both performances, performed on the scene of Athens, showed the audience another way to interpret classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 as the only classical musical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It's true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - I'm talking about instrumentalists, and not composers.
They are trained as "specialized workers".
They themselves feel like they need a conductor.
On the other side of the scene, for the public, all the musical fetish is focused on the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, it's marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So if we look at this world, we have qualified workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but you have to look, which is stupid again," considers David Grimal.
The violinist tells that this change in the way music does came after the "musical disappointments" of his career as a solist.
I was like a high-level athlete who was supposed to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and to bring money and the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So, I've found no more sense to continue on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did anything like that without a conductor: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
"How do I imagine you doing marketing with a collective of musicians in which there is no more ego?" asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Disonaces represents "a luxury", specifying that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor did not prove to be a stumbling block in the musical act: "In a curious way, the more complex we sing a repertoire, so it seems simpler, because all musicians are forced to be present in the opera and not just in the role," Grimal says, adding that at the Sunday show "we were 74 conductors on the stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave", precisely because it invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where there are the largest orchestras in the world that sings and 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you have also invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest for something different, which breaks down barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so that he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music."
Grimal is fighting for the change in the way classical music education is done, considering that "the musical task, as it is organized today, has a death row" and that "the musician represents the music itself".
We don't need to tour the world five times a year if it's useless.
There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, the organization of concerts, festivals, tournaments, the launch of albums are all great, extraordinary, but as long as they do in the service of music.
If not, we're in a system where creativity suffers, no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before you entered the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
In order to enter the EU, we had to adopt health laws which are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are at the service of supermarkets, as is also the case in France.
With music happening the same thing, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes the reds may not be very beautiful, but when we cut them, they're the real reds.
In an ideal world, this music should go back to the center and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese do - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce its learning in school, we reintroduce concerts on television and through this education there would be no need to sell music sub-products," Grimal says.
Surely, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, this everywhere, is a very militarized thing.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, above all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) it must be in some way, if we want to form a musician, it's completely different.
According to your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another kind of making music comes just from overcoming this status of "soldier", overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover in a certain moment that they are not soldiers, and therefore after the concert they come out of range".
David Grimal spoke about the project or music and about his vision of music and the artist at the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized at the International George Enescu Festival by the Aspen Romanian Institute.
David Grimal Profile
After following the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under the guidance of Regis Pasquier, the period in which he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the École des Science Politiques in Paris before meeting with Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed his life course.
David Grimal has an international solo violinist career, along which he has supported regular concerts in the last 20 years on the main classical world music scenes and with prestigious orchestras such as Paris Orchestras, Radio France Orchestras, Russian National Orchestra, National Orchestras of Lyons, Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Berliner Symphonic, New Japan Philharmonic, Opera Orchestra of Lyons, Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and Warsaw Symphony, under the leadership of conductors such as Christoph Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Schønwandt, Peter Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Emmanuel Krivine, Mikhail Pletnev, Rafael Fruzahbeck of Burgos and Peter Eotvos, Andris Nelsons, Christianming.

Along with his solo artist career, David Grimal wanted to explore more personal projects as well.
The freedom he offered to collaborate with Les Dissonances enabled him to develop his inner universe through adventure in repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
Along with Les Dissonances, he set up "L'Autre Saison", a series of concerts given to the benefit and together with the homeless at the Saint-Leu Church, located in the heart of Paris.
Starting in 2008, David Grimal was an artist at the Opera in Dijon.
He teaches violin courses at Musikhochschule in Sarrebruck, Germany.
He also held many master's courses and was a member of the International Long-Thibaud Competition jury in Paris in 2010.
He received the distinction of Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres from the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal sings on a Stradivarius, "ex Roedier" from 1710, but also on "Don Quixote", a violin designed for him by French wrestler Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present on Sunday at the International George Enescu Festival this year together with the Les Dissonances Orchestra, in the program being Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances also went up on the stage, this time with the violinist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "The Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the most challenging challenge for children: doubling two characters from the superproduction "Craisa Snow 3D"
Do you have a super-talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Offer him the chance to get a star.
In September, as part of the newest campaigns dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "The Little Big Voices", giving them an extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animation film.
If in the classic drawings the focus was placed on approaching the voice of the actor of the character of the animated character, in the last period, the creation of the story is taken into account and those who are to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we start an unpublished campaign.
We want to find the right voice and cause parents to register their children for our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the lines are funny.
"Children will have fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, from September 11th to September 30th, Cinema City organizes a preselection following which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be chosen who will have the opportunity to give a test in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access small-voke platform.cinema-city.ro, where to register the child at the contest and prepare it for voice test.
Then you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is about to read and then the child will register by interpreting his or her own version of double.
Four films about friendship, fairy tale heroes, magic and hope can choose contestants to support the sample: "Pene Yellow 3D", "Mone: Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: Koala the Posnaş 3D" and "Albinuta Maya 3D".
In the end, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and will double a character in the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Craisa Snow 3D", which will premiere in Romania in November this year.
FedEx wins are mixed, tax forecasts are down for 2016
FedEx said disappointing results for the last quarter, the deliverable giant reducing the estimates of profit for the year as a result of the low demand for transport services and the higher costs for its land transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company’s shares decreased by approximately 2.5% in the pre-market transaction, 45 minutes before the opening bell’s sound on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said he expected to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of next year, with 20 cents less, according to an earlier estimate.
Analysts predicted the figure of $10.84, according to a factset survey.
The lower estimate comes despite an average price increase of 4.9%, with entry into force on 4 January and the higher surcharges for the land transport of large or large packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it is still expected to increase gains compared to the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher incomes and the development of online trade.
President and Director-General Fred Smith said that "signature is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than is expected, in particular with regard to global production and trade."
Employment plans during the holidays were announced one day after the UPS competitor said he intends to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of commitments he made last year.
In the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx won $692 million, with 6% more than the previous year.
The winnings per action were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 per action made by 12 analysts who responded to the Zacks Investment Research survey.
The profit grew by 5%, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks poll estimated the sum of $12.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been hit by a decline in international priority transport in recent years, leading to the stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has leapt the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, income from the ground division increased by 29%, but operational revenues largely stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in income due to higher basic tariffs, while revenues recorded by the Freight Division decreased due to rising costs.
At the pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, the FedEx shares had dropped by $3.85 or 2.5%, to $150.15.
Tuesday was closed by 11% at year level and by 17% from the highest record recorded on 11 June.
At the most anticipated meetings in recent years, policy makers in the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahon table to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at the end of the meeting hall of the central bank, a mural painting of the United States will appear.
The map is intended to remind that Janet L. Yellen, President Fed, and his colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all.
The Central Bank has received a double duty from Congress: to maximize the employment rate in the US and maintain price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, the Fed leaders confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a too difficult decision to anticipate, which will be announced Tuesday, and will determine whether the US economy is ready to be rid of the unprecedented incentive offered by the short-term interest rate almost zero in force since the end of 2008.
Even if most data indicate a strong economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could frighten Fed officials who are already cautious about adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Evidently, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I believe that if they are looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the growing uncertainty on the world market is sufficient to provide them with arguments to wait further," he said.
There is no consensus on the decision that Fed will make, in itself causing instability on the financial market.
About half of the recent Bloomberg economists anticipated an increase in the interest rate this week.
However, financial markets are expected to delay Fed, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a fall in the stock market if Fed increases the interest rate, unless policy makers would mitigate the blow by promising that it would take a long time to the next increase.
Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, up to 16,599.85.
The advance was triggered by expectations that the Fed decision-makers will maintain a stable interest rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising that Fed would increase the interest rate at the moment," Lonski said.
If the Fed decision-makers do so, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic on financial markets".
Other experts said that an increase in interest rate would ease financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty related to the moment Fed will act.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slowening monetary conditions that would confirm the force of US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expected an increase in the rate of interest this year despite the high liberal objections that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the growth of the labour market was strong this year.
The unemployment rate decreased to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by Fed as total employment.
Wages showed signs of growth.
And although inflation continued to fail to meet the central bank's annual target, the decision-makers Fed said that a key reason was the temporary effect of the oil prices falling sharply.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to enter fibrillations at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by 16% below the highest record achieved in May, as investors were afraid that the slowdown in the Chinese economy would bring world growth down.
The market withdrew somewhat this month, the Dow index now being about 10% below the maximum in May.
For Fed decision-makers, market unrest is added to the complex calculation of the interest rate rise.
"Without what happened on the financial markets and news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be more firm at the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Zimin Center for Real Estate and was officially Fed.
Now, he expects they'll wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy and almost no data to rely on later events in China," Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of Fed's main interests, so it should practically not be taken into account in making decisions.
But, in reality, Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been huge.
The mere allusion of the president, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that Fed could " narrow" its monetary expansion triggered an earthquake on global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are becoming increasingly crowded, it is expected that Fed officials will not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the Global Strategy Department within the Investnet Welfare Management Company Inc.
Jeffrey Laker, Federal Reserve Bank President of Richmond, Va., said this month that "Fed has a history of over-dimensional reaction to changes in the financial market that seem unrelated to economic bases."
Lacker, a member with the right to vote of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body which supported the growth of the interest rate, offered as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis that has affected Asia has led Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "Despite the implications of limited identification for US development," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed officials returned to those casualties.
Fed should put the issue of financial stability in first place only in the event of a major crisis, as was the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate determination commission.
The last troubled period does not even rise far to that level, he said.
"We certainly don't want to get into the situation of fear of an increase in the interest rate because the markets are upset," said President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until something changes in this respect, I do not think that it should take early action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite the attempts of the Nine Channel to broadcast in Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent movement of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject the consequences of changes from the leadership of the Liberal Party did not lead to a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of the Nine Canal broadcasted from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The Sunrise competition, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts carried out over a few weeks, including Dubai, New York, Cascada Niagara and Cancun.
This distance "cross" did not seem to count too much for viewers Aussie TV, Sunrise having a audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today has seen a slight increase compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but the figures were lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has diminished the difference from Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise had 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranges from 40,000 to 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
This morning, not only is Parliament affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the question!

The main news was the startling debut of the 800 Words series with the former star from Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, having as its subject a newly widowed father who decided to move along with his two children on the New Zealand coast, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to face a show alone, without the star from Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
The results of the hearing for last night replied loudly that "yes".
The X Factor show transmitted by Seven remained in position with 1,136 million viewers, taking the face of The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded ups and downs on the second night that he sent The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new moderate general culture show had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) went up to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge number of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The fall of the hearing recorded by Chase Australia in the second evening will give silent confidence to the Nine that Hot Seat will eventually triumph at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to beat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mihail Hodorkovski, Russia's richest man, was arrested under gun threat at an airport in Siberia.
Because it provoked President Vladimir Putin to open, Hodorkovski was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democratic efforts were diminished.
4 people lost their lives after the police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday night in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital of Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of the district police, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police used tear gas after which they fired fire in the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to her, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group claim that the new province established on the basis of the new constitution would diminish their political influence.
Protests also existed in western Nepal, where the ethnic Tharus group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in the violent clashes triggered on 10 August,
when four important political parties signed an agreement for the division of the country into the provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial problem in Nepal, a country governed at central level for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, legislators voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said that the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We're not gonna use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns
The Prime Minister continues the exchange of replies with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the Government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm position against the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, security dogs, wire fences or armed police.
"It is a shame for the 21st century Europe to apply 30s methods." Victor Ponta said
"The first said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established at the CSAT meeting on Thursday." the Prime Minister concluded.

A large low-pressure front at about 560 km south of the southernmost point of Cape Verde Islands is likely to become a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, U.S. National Center for Hurricanes said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low pressure front about half the distance between Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles also presents a 60% probability of the formation of a tropical cyclone over the next two days, added the Miami meteorologist.
Weight reduction surgery may be useful for mild obesity diabetics
The benefits of weight reduction surgery for people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes may be maintained for at least five years according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether mildly obese diabetics live longer after surgery for weight loss than those undergoing non-surgical treatments.
"It takes a lot of time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, because she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, called bariatric surgery, use different methods to reduce the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been performed on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
BMI, a weight measurement unit relative to height, is considered normal in the range 18.5-24.9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's General Hospital Min-Sheng used close data after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastric gastrectomy in manxon - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
Mean BMI in those who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received nonsurgical treatment against diabetes remained almost at the same level, i.e. 29.
Among those who had surgery, diabetes completely cured at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes has completely cured only 1% and partially only 2% of the subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol have generally been better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
Researchers have also monitored the blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar level over time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of A1c haemoglobin is below 7%.
Following surgery, the mean haemoglobin level A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, it remained at approximately 8%.
But this improved "glycemic control" - reflected by the improved levels of A1c hemoglobin - did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared with the mansoon gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), recorded more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%), and presented a higher likelihood of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% compared to 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study carried out on high weight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, Blackstone says, from Arizona University, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery presented a probability of approximately 29% less dying after 15 years compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival in patients undergoing surgery, Blackstone stated that it is an optimistic aspect for people with BMI below 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is the point where this work is critical because it claims that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group," she says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously then the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long until we urge people to take this seriously," she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that have shorted their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader sent an appeal to end the violence in the refugee mother countries.
Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in front of the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
He also stressed that, while admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It is a wonderful concern for a few thousand refugees, but we need to think at the same time about long-term solutions to bring genuine peace and development, especially through education, in Muslim countries," he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
Force never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attacks on 11 September, claiming that the violent response from the US has generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the September 11 events, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong, but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Poisonment Centre, U.S. anti-poison centres have reported an increase of approximately 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed hand cleaners with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Anti-Oison Center, cases of hand-cleaning in children under 12 years of age reported in anti-toxication centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children have more access to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them reach the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some kids drink detergent intentionally and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
YouTube can watch movies that present adolescents how they drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It seems that adolescents mixed the detergent with drinking water to get a stronger drink.
Smaller children can be attracted by the attractive smell of the detergent.
"A child doesn't think it hurts him," Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive (hand detergent) types are the perfumed ones.
Clean hands with strawberry flavor, grape, orange are the most attractive for children.
The detergent contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in small children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-toxicity center at the University Hospital in Kansas, for the Fox 4 Canal in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand cleaners in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested at school the equivalent of four sprays with strawberry-flavored hands detergent, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcohol 179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated him at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was bluffing and couldn't go when he arrived at the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify the signs of brain damage because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free wet products or napkins and stop leaving the detergent at the children's disposal.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hands detergent containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
Health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class students in North New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by "putting antibacterial products into class", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the detergent of hands and has banned him in his classroom.
The police considered the plan to be “insignificant” and raised the disciplinary issue of the school inspectorate.
Rumour Mill: There is no misunderstanding with Celtic
Griffiths unravels the rumors about Celtic's misunderstandings, and he admits that Hoops is not the best time, but they'll be back.
Hearts faced with SFA regarding Neilson and Warburton's accusations are cautious about the January acquisitions that have affected the team's unit
Dons grows the difference from Celtic to five points
The criminalization of ADAM Rooney in the first ceremony brought Aberdeen's victory in front of Hamilton to Pittodrie, Dons getting a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths dismantles rumors about misunderstandings
There were rumors of misunderstanding in Celtic, demolished by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team were not subjected to increased pressure as they were preparing to confront the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Absence of Scots in the race for title bores Dutch - by Boer
The former midwayer of the Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football supporters have lost interest in Celtic - because they don't fight for title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently ambassador to Ajax, said: “In the Netherlands I no longer transmit the summary of Celtic matches; why?”
Because it's not the Rangers there.
Here, it's not just about the Rangers coming back.
It's talking about the Old Firm.
We're talking about both teams at the same time, and that's where the interest is headed.
The tension is high in the games of Old Firm and not only the Scots want to see these games.
I'll change the situation, promise Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted Celtic's fight against the fighting, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat of Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by the defeat in front of Aberdeen who played in 10 people, now in the top of the ranking with a five-point advance.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had periods before and they will come back."
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We really need the support of Celtic because this way players become better.
It's extremely important to remain united now.
Warburton's Prudence on January's Transfers
Despite the comments just a few weeks ago that suggested identifying a few targets for transfers in January, the leader of the Rangers, Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the team's Bemox unit.
The former head of Brentford said: "The transfer period in January is very different from the one in the summer."
In the case of the players transferred this summer, there is the period before the season where they can be integrated, which you could observe this season in our group.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring unnecessary players.
Celtic targets Michu after retreat
The striker from Swansea, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he might withdraw at the end of the contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player struggled two years with ankle problems and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts faced with SFA regarding Neilson's comments
Hearts were driving with 2-1 when Paterson was removed and they lost with 3-2, but the red card was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: “I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance.”
Griffiths swear to avoid Tyncastle
The invincible Hibee was picked up after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about his former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the excitement of the moment," the striker said, adding: "I don't have to say that I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council Trusts Management Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that Council Dundee United still trust that the management team will change the situation - but he agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll bring the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for "filth victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that the team in Aberdeen has to cling desperately to Hamilton Accies to get the seventh successive victory in the league, which brought them five points in front of Celtic due to the punishment shot from the first round performed by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won something, in the cup or league, and that has not won games like this."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged as Britain grows
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, with 164,000 in May, while the number of unemployed in the UK total increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that in Britain, of 5.5%, according to the figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the period of three months, the number of those currently employed is 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland decreased by 74.0% in that quarter - an average figure of 73.5 in Britain.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The long-term plan of authorities laid the foundations for a stronger economy.”
It's been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, employment rates with growth and unemployment rates.
Why I'm a witness at an execution in Oklahoma
During today's day, except for a late legal intervention, I'll look at how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll stay in a room for observers in the execution room of the Prisoner of Oklahoma State and I'll see how Richard Glossip is running through lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted it.
As the day approaches with reason, it frightens me of the idea.
So why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It's true, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America, and since requests usually exceed the number of places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places reserved to press representatives from 12 to five.
The chosen will look impartially at the execution.
I can't do that.
I would stay with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I also developed my own relationship with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to note what I see.
I'll have to try and remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wishes, get access.
I cried at her.
He acknowledged that “it could have been better,” but he still feels that I am wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it even if he asked me to.
I told him he could get me out of the witness list any time.
However, he wishes to see an international report on the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the series of media files we did.
I'm not going back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely that he's not guilty of murder.
I don't think there was enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from this perspective.
I can't claim to be totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to look at a man I like dying useless.
Peter Moody claims that the Stewarts tried to spy on him and threatened to retreat from the race
Peter Moody said that the Warden Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy in his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on the Stewarts and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they are carrying out a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass by removing Lady Dad from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the field of racing and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words concerning statements about spies and did not want to resemble “the fox that doesn’t reach grapes”.
"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I've been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to such a high level of frustration that everything suddenly bursts," Moody said.
It's known that it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep quietly.
I want to go straight up and I want the owners I work with to see that you're trying to give them everything that's best.
From the moment they start to think that doesn't happen like this, I have to give up the coaching job.
At that point, I'm gonna have to think about what I'm gonna do with my certification.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview for racing.com in which he said the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
"Eighty months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man - whose name I'm going to tell him if I'm asked - and offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the activity there," Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously he considers me a cheater.
If so, then we should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and know today.
Should I believe it's personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and may take responsibility from outside trainers for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
So bad is my influence on the industry?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I need to take my license and turn me aside and I have no doubt that the statements I make now might make him think about this option.
But I've got to the point where I don't care anymore that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on it and make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can go.
Frustration of the trainer increased with the long investigation of cobalt testing involving Lidari and the elimination led him to state that he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the unconquered Black Caviar champion, has labelled the treatment rule of the day of the race as "ridical" after applying on the horses a cataplasm with mud or clay, which violates the rules.
It violates the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for treatment on the day of the race consisting of the application of cataplasm, for which the Stewarts opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that there is a need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran from the accident site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a crash with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by escape from the accident site.
The biker was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit on Saturday morning by a car on the Murray Valley motorway.
Police officials say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured biker.
Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to the Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be accused of escaping from the scene of the accident, of not providing first aid and other road offences.
The biker, a 40-year-old man in Cobram, remains admitted, stable.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, responds to the charges of wrestling.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticisms brought by his team as "distorted subjects" brought up by the top two NRL favorites.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said the referees allowed Storm players to "take the team up" in Storm's angry match at the final qualification played Friday night in Sydney.
The coach at Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory in the North Queensland Cowboys qualifying match, played Saturday night, when he called that game a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said that the two teams in Queensland are not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in defense of his team's approach to the plaque tactic and said that the players were simply focusing on "contact" when they were plated.
Bellamy says she got her confidence after two important coaches criticized her team, which means they were worried Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us with score 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, just that in the last six weeks I've really put the emphasis on contact in the plaques and so I've changed the situation.
Trent is in this function for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so he's probably not used to losing and was a shock to him.
It's funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "soul football", reminding his mentor St. George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the 2010 championship by playing "plier" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He argued by comparing his game Saturday night with our game Friday night and talked about how exciting the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George got a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care as much about black under the nail.
But now he has a team that can play what we consider to be exciting football, especially because of the fast-paced young averages.
This kind of game you want to play when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two middle teams like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking about us when they were thinking about the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the battle between Storm and Roosters was a more sharp score match compared to the match between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven't seen him yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more trials, that's exciting game?
Or is it exciting to take breaks and not mark?
They're plans for me.
If I talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm has free this weekend because they won the right to play home either with North Queensland Cowboys or with Cronulla Sharks, in the end of next Saturday's Preliminarys, at AAMI Park, the tickets being sold from next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep and then authenticated in an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with children as a subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was asleep.
He looked in the phone and found the disturbing messages after which he immediately alerted his mother.
Upon arrival, the police saw the five photos and then analyzed computers found at that address and found "anxious" searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images with children.
Hogg claimed that he did it to "attract pedophiles" on the Internet before "he pretends he's a cop to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee court: “He said it’s an addiction - it’s dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to become a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and about the fact that he asked the person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to bring in.
He said he doesn't think clearly when he drinks and wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she yelled at her mother and trembled and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, 23-year-old Hogg, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to accusations that he had made or made indecent pictures of children, and violated the conditions of parole on 25 January this year and was not brought before the court at the appearance of 24 March the current year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim called for Hogg not to be registered in the register of sex offenders because it can be said that this crime "has not involved a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October, for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before the appearances for other files.
It was passed in the register of sex offenders before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
But the shooting of the fall didn't get hurt has become viral on the social networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by representatives of the opposition who said they would have received anonymous death threats, threatening that Mr Mugabe would not have to flee during his speech.
Last month he escaped during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Head of Parliamentary Group Movement for Democratic Change (MCC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but it is called "death," he told the journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns the parliamentarians concerned that immunity applies only to Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity no longer has value.
The head of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is “anxious” in terms of threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availabilitys
It is expected that Hewlett-Packard will make between 25,000 and 30,000 deliveries as part of the restructuring and cost reduction efforts in the service sector.
This year. HP will split on the stock market into two companies, separating the division of computers and printers from the operations with growing corporate hardware and services.
The expected availability will cost approximately $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP company said.
"These restructurings will bring to the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable cost structure," said Meg Whitman, President and CEO HP, who will lead the unit after breaking.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more concentrated than HP at present and will hold a large business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of companies to the new business style," Whitman said.
Acting as a separate society, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing requirements of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and will "focus on providing integrated solutions without rivals" to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, with the activity of the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the Silicon Valley.
HP went through a massive reorganization to adapt to switching from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The HP measure, the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest companies in the US technology field, is the most recent in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in a direction have a better performance.
FriendsFest: The comedy series that taught us important lessons about men's friendship
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in 20-45-year-old men in Britain, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign against Unhappy Life (Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM)) designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wanting to put under the sign of the cultural question that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
The friendship lies at the centre of the struggle towards the success of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough of many friends “with a healthy mood”, his chances of recovery are doubled.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy friends reduces the likelihood of mental disorders to half.
Of course, for friendship to take effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis is placed on style rather than substance, the immediate nature of the response often has priority prior to meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even though isolation is actually the dominant one.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which also affect our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money really doesn't buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments he looks at football in comfortable armchairs and Ross's passion for Rachel came from the fact that men are known to be associated with this situation, even though they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: "my role in listening to people who tend to commit suicide and depressed has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, people who call us are not able to talk to their friends.
The old saying to do it alone is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as weak person if you speak openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more mechanisms for long-term psychological adaptation.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as helps objective, external intervention, through the telephone, people arriving in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you participate in this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the complete editing of filming platforms to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee shop in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - on the occasion #FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG to give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after marking against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped PSG to get in front of the Swedish Malmo team.
Next we present the game chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have done their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the series of matches in the Champions League groups, with a 2-0 win against Malmo in the game played Tuesday on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the French champions to the advantage although they missed a number of occasions before securing their goal goal scored by Cavani in minute 61.
Reaching the A Group with Real Madrid and Sahtior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the aim of the French team is not only to qualify for the best but also to improve the course towards final quarters in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity to empty after which was replaced by the team in his hometown and the club at which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or move into the Champions League, so victory with 2-0 creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference to the next class, even if there are more aspects that we need to perfect throughout the season," says Blanc.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I'm sorry we couldn't give another one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident at one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 remittance obtained from Bordeaux in Liga 1 on the weekend, but Di Maria took the light from the reflectors in the 4th minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive middleman was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and showed this when he spawned at Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defense before incredibly kicking over Johan Wiland, in the long corner of the right gate.
But if someone expected PSG to win the victory by punching in their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national team owners, with a defense of five and two middle defenders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except by making Nikola Djurdjic's tweet that passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed down several times, giving a few unnecessary and unfinished passes, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts only in the first round and was then replaced by the Cavani just after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved to be much more skilled in supporting his colleagues, caring for him being the one that Di Maria sent in a hijacked blow by Wiland over the gate in the minute 52.
The second goal was written in the end after an hour of the match was over, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who wrote the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's centre.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hopes that they will rebalance Wiland's score and only a superb remote stop for rejecting David Luiz kept the final score before the new entry Ezequiel Lavezzi cancels an extension goal.
Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later said that PSG was with a class over and that "the last match I played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Lower the hat for PSG.
They did an excellent game.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion from stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by the decline in stock prices on the commodity market, has raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a comprehensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore company, quoted on the London stock market, said it sold new £1.6 billion shares to pay for the debt.
After it lost 57% of its market value this year, the company is hit by falling prices on the commodity market because China's economic decline influences demand and causes disaster in markets.
The preferential subscription law increased the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning transactions.
The shares increased by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings in the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore has revealed the sale of $2.5 billion shares as part of larger plans to cover nearly a third of its 30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 shillings per share, 2.4% less than the closing price on Tuesday.
It took 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern about the growth of the prolonged Chinese economy has led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half and coal, copper and other goods have fallen by 20-40%.
Xi insists on expanding the global economy
Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy needs to open up more to the outside world to feed growth.
"China must commit itself to attracting foreign investment and expertise and to improve opening policies," Xi said, at the 16th Meeting of the Central Steering Group for the Continued General Reforms (Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform).
Promoting the opening and encouraging of reforms will bring new embold and vitality and bring about economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulations, relaxation of customs control policies, encouraging state enterprises to absorb private capital and the reorganization of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify sectors and areas of activity in which investment is not permitted.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in allocating resources, ensuring a legislative-based business environment and providing a wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers delegated to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their business.
China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
"State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investment and provide them with better services," he said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards" by optimizing the requirements and smoothing the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the right to practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and the leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, not satisfied with the proposal of the government to increase wages by 10%
The negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the trade unions in Education have not achieved any results, the Government proposing a 10% increase in wages from 1 December, paid on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase in November, or 20% in December.
The discussions took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, the prime minister being accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The proposal of the government today has not satisfied us, otherwise we would not have come to the position of convening the leadership of our federations.
The 10 percent that we were promised today is less for us than we expected.

Victor Ponta also promised trade unionists to pay for all the court sentences in 2016.
Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 immigrants drowned on Tuesday in Turkish territorial waters after the boat was wrecked.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, AFP informs, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed to the Greek island Kos.
The Turkish coast guard reported that it has managed to save 249 people who were in the wrecked boat, but still do not know their nationality.
Previously, Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also, on the weekend, 34 immigrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned on the Greek island of Farmakonisi, 15 km from the Turkish coasts.
The situation was similar: the boat transports more people than its capacity, so it sank.
The road has become a popular one lately for immigrants who want to escape the war and the heavy life of countries such as Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 Stewardese, fired because they were too fat
Air India's airline fired about 130 stewarzi and Stewardese because they were overweight, announced the company at the end of last week.
The state company announced that the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the measure is "ridiculous" and "sexist shock," says The Washington Post.
Mass release is the most recent of a ten-year struggle between the company and the most crowded stewardess.
The weight limit for them dates back to the '80s, when Air India started using graphics with the weight and the ideal height.
In 2006, Air India fired the new Stewardese considered "exceptional overweights", as this "may have an effect on reflections and may prevent the necessary agility to carry out emergency measures".
The Stewardes have sued the company, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to make them weak have failed," explains one company spokesman.

If the champion's financier decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable amount, the founder Paul Papp opened a football school.
The "Paul Papp" Academy will function in the town of Dej, the children in the town being expected at a first selection action.
I'm extremely happy that I've reached this stage, to give the start to the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find gifted children, who can play football without worrying material at the training.
They have to take only one care: that of playing football the best.
The technical details must not be their concern.
They must value their talent.
This is what he wants to do the 'Paul Papp' Football Academy.
"I'm also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of the children, to show them that he's with them," Papp footballer for dejean.ro said.
At the Academy of the Founder of the Star, children are expected up to 11 years of age.
The whole party wants the government.
The interim president of PSD Liviu Dragnea said Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and, if the prime minister wants, the PSD Congress will formalize this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to rule, the whole party.
If we want to formalize through a Congress ruling, we'll do that too.
There'll be no emotion about it.
"There have been no elements, voices in the party, party opinions that give to someone insecure to the government or to give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current Prime Minister," Dragnea said at the end of the Permanent Office of the PSD.
PSD announced when Congress will be held - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Tuesday that it is important that at the PSD Congress, beyond the choice of leadership, a clear message be given if the continuation of the government is wanted or if the party decides to go against it.
Dragnea: I'll let you know on Monday if I'm running for a job at Congress.
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next month if he is running for a leadership function at the future Congress.
I'll sing, Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is set.
"I'll announce if I'm running for a party leadership function," Dragnea said at the end of the Tuesday session of the National Permanent Bureau of the PSD.
I asked if the hesitation about the candidate's announcement had anything to do with his file, Dragnea said he didn't have this problem.
I don't have a problem you're referring to, but I think it's fair and honest with all my colleagues in the party to tell me or not an application when the Congress's date is formally established.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of social-democratic branches proposed extraordinary PSD Congress on 11 October, and the exact date of Congress will be decided on Monday by the Party's Executive Committee.

I'm not sorry I left the national right now.
Then I felt bad, leaving a job behind.
That's how I thought it was good for me then and I think it was good for me.
What happens to me when I was a picker, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, I didn't respect my work.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found out different opinions from the press about me.
It didn't change me because it was very hard at the time, with the results I had, plus the financial situation in the middle.
I went on to work, everything went very well and probably changed and he changed his ideas.
But I wanted to go.
If he really wanted me to stay, then I offered them a contract deal.
We have around 400 and a few thousand euros a year, and I have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but with his right hand.

The rare disease a man suffers from
American Nick Hess was suspected by his family of being an alcoholic, the wife actually filming him when he was dizzy, he could barely keep his feet and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he didn't drink alcohol, it was visible that he was drunk.
When he first accused me of being drunk, without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family believed 'maybe they drank on their own, he's an alcoholic in secret'," he says, according to Mirror.
When he saw the footage of his wife with him, the man in Columbus, Ohio, he just didn't recognize himself: "I looked in my eyes and I wasn't there."
'It was awful, I didn't remember anything'.
Besides, his wife, who, although she doubted himself for a while, finally went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath also smelled of alcohol.
The moment that put Nick the most into thinking was when, after a minor accident, when he had been hit by another car, he discovered that he had alcohol three times above the legal limit, even though one night before he had consumed only one beer.
After years and investigations without number, it was discovered that Nick was suffering from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Practically, the body or it makes all carbohydrates use to ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who assumed that this might be Nick's disease was even his wife.
The disease hasn't had a cure yet, but since he gave up carbohydrates, Nick hasn't had such episodes.
He destroyed a Mercedes with a golf cross
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest of the services he had taken from his dealer.
The man "has attacked" his car with a golf cross, causing damage enough for the car to be removed from use, transmits BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video came online, towards the fun of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has flaws that endanger his life and his family.
His anger came up when the dealer he bought the car didn't solve his problem, as agreed.
The government approved, on Wednesday, "The National Immigration Strategy 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the Current Year", documents considered to be "still a stage in Romania's efforts to modernise the immigration management process on national territory", according to a press release.
The above-mentioned source shows that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines reflecting policies at European level adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the States in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are envisaged for unit management and consistency of situations caused by the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants in Romania, generated by political, social, economic or military crises.
"Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time will pay special attention to citizens from states with potential migrants or who may affect national security," adds the source mentioned.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in neighbouring areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document sets out and a number of general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls on the legality of the residence of third-country nationals in Romania and the corresponding application of removal measures and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
Among these are: facilitating access to Romanian territory for third-party citizens who respond to the needs for employment of the labour force, promoting access for third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for areas and professions identified as deficits.
With regard to the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciated that it represents "a means by which concrete activities are established to lead to the creation of a flexible system for stopping the growing migration phenomenon".

Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria have recorded the great increase in the total labour force cost of the EU Member States in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2014, according to the data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to expenditure on employers' staff.
Thus, from April to June 2015, the total labour force cost rose by 1.9% in the European Union and 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, third in the EU at rising labour costs

The only EU states in which the hourly labour force cost fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
Advances in labour force costs in Romania from April to June 2015 are mainly due to the increase in the hourly cost of labour force in industry and services, with 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly cost of the labor force.
Activity report of the TVR management, rejected in the committees: Stelian Tanse risks dismissal
Parliament's Culture Committees rejected the 2014 work report of the Board of Directors of the Roman Television Society on Wednesday.
In order to reject the report, 17 Members voted against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the Permanent Bureaus meeting.
They'll probably decide next week.
The next plenary meeting will be discussed.
"I think that in view of this situation will be done relatively quickly," said President of the Culture Commission of the Senate, Georgica Severin.
He added that the "good sense" was that TVR would also be present at this meeting, under the conditions that no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the Culture Committees meeting.
It was good sense to be in charge of TVR because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation was made to CA members last night, at an approximate hour that we didn't know the time, but today, after the meeting of the Bureaus, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I think that the moment you're summoned, you being a budget employee, paid out of public taxes and you're summoned to a meeting of the commissions meeting even if you don't like life.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution under the order of Parliament," Severin said after the Committees meeting in Parliament's culture.
He added that at the meeting the financial aspects of the institution were discussed on the basis of the negative opinion of the Committees of Budget.
The debts we also saw how they continued came up with the idea that this year would have been up to date, but they didn't pay from the historical ones.
"I remind you that it is not my fault or someone else in these committees who has lost that leisure with the banks and the fiscal, there are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the meeting plenary will be followed by elections for a new Board of Directors, and he will choose the director general of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this function.
Miracles won't be done.
It is important to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand at the tail here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the whole of Parliament, by their vote, will vote for the people who will run TVR with a great deal of reason.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of correctness and respect for institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities you have to have -- feel good about the attitude of employees because it's a bunch of small ones coming from employees, complaints, layoffs.
"When you get these 50, 60, 70 sessions, something is rotten and we're talking about the financial situation that's a disaster," the President of the Culture Committee in the Senate concluded.
Although it has not been presented to Parliament, the President-General of the TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, requesting that Parliament consider a number of measures that could lead to the saving and guaranteeing economic and political independence of public television, including by counting and indexing TV tax.
In its letter, Stelian Tanse requests, in addition to indexing the TV tax, to amend and supplement HG 978/2003 on the fee for public television service, for updating the provisions in terms of the current technological changes, as well as for regulating the procedure for controlling the payment of the TV tax and for finding contraventions and the application of penalties and penalties.
He also wishes to issue a provision providing for the extension of the obligation for all electricity providers to become SRTv’s agents for the collection of TV tax by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his view, it is necessary to establish a ceiling of up to 5% of the commission in incarceration.
Stelian Tanse calls for the reduction of the VAT quota for the activities specific to the public television station and the contribution for CNC from 15% to 3%, but also for the amendment of the Law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility of receiving the budget/financing allocation for the purchase of licenses for major cultural and sporting events - the World Football Championship, Cerbul de Gold, Eurovision.
He claims that SRTv will become unable to pay in the following months since the labour legislation obliges the employer to execute judgment decisions, even if they are not definitive, and salary rights are accorded priority to any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce spending on staff and TV production.
"Then the travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a series of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News post was closed", it appears in the letter of the president of TVR.
Much appreciation is that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by its own efforts.
"Without the support of State institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Roman television will be, sooner or later, unable to fulfill its public mission", mentioned in the letter.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies has decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
The son-in-law of Vasile Blaga, sent to court
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to court on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Park near the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
It is accused of tax evasion, in a file with prejudice of approximately 600,000 euros, under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on 22 May.
He established Axis Corporate Security SRL security firm, with his mother in April 2009, one year after he married Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigation showed that, for the purpose of subtracting taxes and taxes from the state budget, representatives of a company specialising in security service provision would have created an infringement circuit, made up of several commercial companies, through which fictional transactions would have been evident.
"In fact, the company's accounting would have been recorded for the fictitious purchase of services, which, in fact, were not provided, the state budget being so damaged with about 600,000 euros," the Roman Police explained in a press release.

Although the Arab press announces that the separation of Sanmartean from Ittihad is imminent, the entrepreneur of the manager Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will not happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays game title match and does it well.
They also realized that he was the best and that he would be wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been possible to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been more discussions, like the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has come about," Zaporojanu said for Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad early this year.
Elie Sarbu was voted vice-president of the Court of Auditors
The plenary voted on Wednesday for the appointment of PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes "for" and 108 "against" were recorded.
The vote was secret, with ballots.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, informs Digi24.
On the other hand, the liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment to this function and announced that they would challenge her to the CCR, under the conditions that he has a DNA file, but he has no necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has at his disposal 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics anymore.
The PSD senator will serve as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, free press after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court of September 2014, which found that he was called unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
How Bradley Cooper is going to play the role of a cook in the "Burn" movie, the actor made a disassembly that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew more in the kitchen: "I worked most of my life as a cook."
He revealed that he had worked in the kitchen for 15 years, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, so that then, in college, he continued on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so the entire childhood cooked with the Italian grandmother, relates ContactMusic.
I asked what future plans he had at that time, Bradley Cooper said that he was never the type of man who made plans for five years, "not even two."
"It's not at all motivating for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you would laugh about if I told you," he said, saying but what he wanted from childhood was fulfilled.
At the age of 40, the actor acknowledged that he sees himself in the near future by taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who has taken over at this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned hard Wednesday morning the statements of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta according to whose political decisions in Hungary are "with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational claims, offended the entire Hungarian government," the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs told a communiqué.
Civilized European politicians don't say such uncontrollable slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has lost his full support in Romania's domestic policy," said MTI, the chief of Hungarian diplomacy.
In a Tuesday night post on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wants to attract attention and sanction the behaviour of high Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not want to respond to the challenges that have come from Hungarian government representatives.
"This is a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in terms of the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!" said Ponta on Facebook.
The Roman Premier added that he is committed to rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, appreciating that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Shampoo sarma, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries that run away from those refugees!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in recent days in Hungary is in complete contradiction to these objectives and values!", he stressed the head of the Roman executive.
Earlier Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described as "simple lies" the remarks of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta on the management by Hungary of the refugee crisis, appreciating that these claims are inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned Tuesday as the "extremist and lying remarcations" of the Roman Prime Minister of Romania's internal political crisis and stated that Budapest is waiting for an apology from the Roman side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have said and always say is that I am against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the borders, that all who come are terrorists, are fools of the Middle Ages and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get it, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people like people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with bat and insert.
"That's not what I agree with," said the head of the Roman executive, at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Government of Budapest has decided to begin preparations in the field to extend to Romania the fence he builds on the border with Serbia, to face a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Next, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision to lift a border fence did not solve any of the refugee issues and "Hungary Schools in Europe".
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of Mecca's crane?
Saudi authorities have announced that Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is "partially responsible" for the collapse of a crane, Friday, on the Great Mosque of Mecca, accident following the death of 107 people.
According to a committee of inquiry, the company did not "respect the safety rules", the Saudi press agency (SPA) reported BBC.
The company's directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
Also, the firm will be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently led by the former terrorist leader Bakr's brother.
Binladen Group has been working for four years to expand the Great Mosque, to be able to host more pilgrims.
The accident occurred Friday night, during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong gusts of wind, collapsed on the aesthetic side of the Mecca's Great Mosque roof.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and almost 400 were injured.
How Hagi shut up the contestants
Considered by many of the world's greatest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labelled after his withdrawal from activity as a weak coach, who cannot be able to perform performance and in the new position.
After unhappy experiences at the national team, Star or Galatasray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team that he is sponsoring.
After a year of taking over the team, the King has shown that he is capable of transforming a team that was struggling to save from retrograde into a top.
Thus, after a year, Viitorul recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 remittances and 11 defeats.
The biker is one of a top team, beating at the European Cups.
Things took a turn and better for the future this season, as the team reached second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the Astra Giurgiu leader.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double the star.
On the other hand, even if it brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period on the starting team names such as Yanis Hagi or Hodorogea appeared.
Club policy made Viitorul a team to follow for teams abroad, so Hagi sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Along with the Star, the Future is the only profitable team in the League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
Great countries come with solutions for the entire EU, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the governing college of the Roman Centre for European Policy.
In an interview with Diare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we doubt the quality of the values these people come with."
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality to which we need to adapt as best and adapt them to us.
In the opinion of Cristian Ghinea, we are at an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, the Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted for the situation now".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JHA council that actually solved nothing?
It is clear that the EC President agreed with Donald Tusk that they did not want to strengthen a vote in the Council.
All the predictions said that he would have had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies in JHA and any State may block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, and the Council approves it by the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go before.
Because it's a sensitive issue, rejection reactions have emerged even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel's opening policy and they didn't want many countries to appear as an EU-type reaction sending migrants to our heads.
So they learned, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen government and we will probably see big changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just let to cool off?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of the Frontex agency in the management of external borders, which means a shift from individual responsibility of members at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of Community agents.
The Greek border with Turkey is also the border of Germany with Turkey, in fact, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps he will give up the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are responsible for the first-time state, because he is not sustainable.
If Greece capsizes, you can't tell the infinites that it's Greece's business.
Problem and common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to resolve without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism of sharing the reception effort?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if they get to them.
Because there is still a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states will pick up the migrants: you're going to country X or country Y.
It will probably reach some unique filtering centres, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications are processed.
They're working on solutions like that.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience trying to integrate migrants, they are countries without any experience, such as Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase xenophobic current.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just started to leave for Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have gotten away, winter is hard to get past the Mediterranean, but we're expecting next year at a wave maybe even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we're going to get used to this problem, we're not going to look at it so badly from a media point of view.
You were talking about country with less or greater experience.
Do you think there is any place where it has really succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-European culture?
I'm looking at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're all enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course their integration is more difficult than in other waves of migration, but that doesn't mean it doesn't fit at all.
There is still an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, Britain.
But pure police means won't work.
To create the fortress of Europe is illusory.
The integration mechanisms in European societies need to be addressed.
Here were some mistakes.
We need to be more careful.
To ask these people to learn their language, to try to take the values, not to be left with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family including by convenient couples.
However, the imminent problem of these people's long-term problems of integration must be separated.
If others have failed in long-term integration it does not mean that we have to look at them as they drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't think, it doesn't mean it's going to be overnight and you can take it back.
Until the solutions come up, we see fortresses in Europe.
Borders are closed, walls are lifted, border controls are re-introduced into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such does not, the Schengen space as it was built, yes.
It was built pretty minimal and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where I set foot for the first time these migrants.
I mean, we're running around there, but everyone's in trouble.
In front of such a wave it can't be so, because some countries don't face it.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run there's no big change.
After the attacks in France, we do not have much more drastic anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that settles in both directions.
And it's so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions on her basis.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virile.
And then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and the public opinion gets excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the only real European market.
And I don't think the Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
There's gonna be other rules.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted for the situation now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a little country, who thinks that, if she pulls the bag into the eye and stubs her ears, the theme disappears.
In the face of the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your little country problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the 7th country of the EU.
You're not, you're not playing high country.
Great countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not now discussing their quality.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Romans' appetite for Schengen will be greatly reduced.
President Iohannis says it's possible we haven't already entered.
So we move from despairing the entrance to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen as migrants see us as an alternative route.
Which doesn't mean it's a reason we don't go into Schengen anymore, but let's be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed into a common responsibility for external borders, they will be unique rules for the acceptance of migrants, a single rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, a single rules for countries that are considered safe.
The Ukrainian President said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria in Ukraine no one died.
Is there a connection between the two focusses, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She thinks it's great power to confuse the Americans and the Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before the main opponent to be the Islamic State.
About two years was a struggle between the Assad regime and the secular and moderate Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf countries and Westerners.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia was able to complicate things, but it can't participate in the solution.
She creates focus of instability and chaos that she can't shut down.
But you're great power only if you have solutions.
The game off-side is just a strategy to make time.
Putin's probably waiting to make offers, he's gonna pull the buttons to solve the situation.
The offers don't come because the world isn't convinced that he can solve in one way or another issues created by him all.
But I don't agree with the theories that say these people are led by an invisible hand.
Let's not see a little stronger than it is.
What a button he'll show up soon.
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now representatives of the social media are preparing another opposite, the "Dislike".
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will soon be available, informs the New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg specified that the "Dislike" button will rather show a shade of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised the problem that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike".
The network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long called for the ability to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said it's not very comfortable for people to give "like" current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of a family member's death.
"You may not feel comfortable giving that post like," Facebook said.
The variant of a new button on Facebook was not welcomed by everyone.
"There is already enough hate on Facebook and social media," Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan commented on the New York Times Facebook page, where the article was posted with this subject.
"I'll give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," said this.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, claimed that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, social media analyst at the eMarketer company, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she supports, the electoral campaign is approaching in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a hand out of thousands coming to mass on its southern border with Serbia, announced government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary declared its state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it would build a fence at its border with Romania, recalls DPA.
The measure attracted a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they'd seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to ask for asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," said Serbian Minister for Refugees, Aleksandar Vulin.
Prior to the imposition of the new immigration legislation, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced on Monday.
More than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa also visited Hungary in Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and trying to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" seat of the County Council stands to sting.
Two builders, insolvency
The massive investments made here over the last few years, with a view to moving the institution, are breaking down because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
The County Council's headquarters on Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up crashing alone.
A year and a half after the building's consolidation and rejuvenation had been completed, the works had not even reached half.
One final step in the building's era was consumed last days when the National Council for the Settlement of Answers (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the contract for the implementation of the technical project for the further works to be carried out.
The initial project was designed by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the manufacturer's insolvency entry and the interruption of works, negotiations were initiated without the publication of an announcement of participation with Impex Romcatel, the firm was to update the technical project and then a new tender for works was organised.
"The negotiations were not completed by a contract, however, considering that the proposed form would have disadvantageed the institution," said Răzvan Timofciuc, representing public relations within the JC.
The CJ decision to discontinue direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
The original court sent the complaint to CNSC, which rejected it as late as possible.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the CNSC decision at the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of it being able to consider finding another designer.
Thus, building-building work could be resumed at the earliest in the coming year.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"Let's wait to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
Work on strengthening the former police headquarters started in 2011.
A first contract of work was terminated in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei had been carried out.
The tender was resumed, the contract being adjudicated by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the firm entered into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after 1.5 million lei had been paid.
The work has been done up to now in proportion to approximately 50%.
Initially, work on consolidation, rejuvenation and basement of the building had been evaluated at 7.7 million lei.
"All right, I say everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastru
One of the employees involved in the scandalous case at the Cadastru Office signed an agreement to acknowledge the facts, against prison delay.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the others accused, in front of the former head, Narciza Nedelcu
An adviser at the Office of Real Estate Registration and Advertising (OCPI) Iași accused of DNA in a file of corruption recognized his face.
The Agreement on the Recognition of the Facts Signed by Dumitru Destălu was registered yesterday at the Iași Court, the judges establishing a solution in this case on 29 September.
Daniel Destălu was accused of continuing false intellectuals and agreed to execute two years in prison with delay, as well as work for the community.
With regard to the facts imputed to Dasălu, the prosecutors stated that he, as advisor to the Cadastru Office, together with other colleagues, "has forged in false several acceptance minutes, by selling the prior-chain service contracts by O.C.P.I. Iasi with the directors of SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Five SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC The SRL Office and SRL Topography and PFA Lipșa Ştefan, which actually testified that the contracted services were fully performed, under conditions where they were not performed and were not submitted to O.C.P.I. Yași".
Last days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of the OCPI were sued in this file, the charges being the settlement of services to those companies, although the works were not carried out.
Pre court exceeds 300,000 lions.
Adventures in Stone Age
In the opinion of FRH president Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the national women's handball for qualifying at the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday in a press meeting that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for Romania's national women's handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Olympic Games in Rio, but for that it must pass two stages of caudine forks, first of all the World Championship and secondly the prequalification tournament," said Dedu.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff who will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants a second coach, a doctor, two men, a porter coach, a physical prep, a head of delegation.
They asked us to get the qualification of some things, more precisely materials for physical training, which I've never heard of.
These all to get to the Olympics. And I'll do whatever it takes to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to perform.
Because right now we're in the Stone Age with the preparation.
"The teams we beat have these materials and have some time," said Dedu, who mentioned that he is trying to get the necessary amounts for the purchase of these products from MTS and COSR.
President FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility for our country to host a major handball competition.
We don't have a room in Bucharest.
It is a question of infrastructure and it is shameful to be asked a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let's not forget that in other corners of the world, Olympic neighborhoods have been built entirely within two years.
Before 1992, in the present Olympic area of Barcelona was a waste dump, and now there was a hint of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics was a success and from the point of view of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," said Dedu.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania a major competition.
For me, it's a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gațu went civilized with a project, people agreed in principle, but they quickly explained that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, I told them that we wanted, that we were able to organize and they said they agreed and invited them to the first game in the new gym in Bucharest and then we were talking concretely.
"So we have all the opening, and at EHF and IHF, but we don't have infrastructure," explained FRH official.
The former great handballist avoided evaluating the chances of women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to arrive in Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be booked in forecasts, that if they don't come back against them."
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian rugbists debut on September 23rd, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said Tuesday in a press conference that all of Romania's members are prepared for the World Cup matches in England, where they hope to win two wins: "We are ready".
Both me and my colleagues are with engines at full speed.
We trained to give the best performance in the four games.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All the groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
However, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it's the celebration of all these years of work.
I wish I didn't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with beautiful results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romanian National Team Selection Officer Lynn Howells, first experienced as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby selection: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup."
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
For me it is very important that every match make Romanians proud of the national team.
Romanian Rugby Federation President Haralambie Dumitraș is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in the last few years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish athletes success and I am convinced that we will be at the height of the event.
"These guys started playing on Romanian teams at 18-19, so there's cohesion, it's a band of friends, who set themselves to realize a dream," Dumitras said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will move to Group D with the following matches scheduled: with France on 23 September in London; with Ireland on 27 September in London; with Canada on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday, at Twickenham Stadium in London, with the English-Phiji game in group A.

14 million lei give the "St. Spiridon" hospital in Iași to budgetary correction
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
The "St. Spiridon" hospital received about 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health, following the budgetary adjustment.
The money that the medical unit has received to use by the end of the year will be invested in the modernization and repair of clinics, but also in equipment and medical technique for which the hospital has already begun public procurement.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology machine, with six kits used for surgery, six beds of ATI equipped with appropriate equipment, an ophthalmogenic microscope and other necessary equipment to carry out the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received from the hospital will be directed to the construction and construction work of the "Mare Ars".
From the money from the budgetary correction, UPU will receive 500,000 lei to complete the modernization work in the main section.
"In addition, the following days we will be receiving the work from the gateway that links UPU to cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the decent transport of UPU disease to nearby clinics," the health unit manager explained.
The hospital will soon have in the yard and the dermatology clinic in Tătărasi, which it will organize in the outpatient clinic, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where there is allergy, hematology and endocrinology in the outpatient clinic and will have about 30 beds.

The homeland of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience neither I nor my wife ever want us to step back in your city.
Without wanting to, they hit the erroneous information in the folds, the failure of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine "as the law says".
The husbands arrived in Iasi a few days ago, settled in a hotel in the center and asked for tourist trips.
They also received a fold in which the RATP tracks were past.
"Armed" with these maps, the husbands visited the Iash.
But two days ago, when you were in Copou, they wanted to get to the Palace Mall.
Because it wasn't a ton of tickets in the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the fold: that I can take the ticket via SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Trusters in the fold, they got on a bus and tried to text after the instructions on the fold.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said there's been no service for two years and they've been reporting in the press that he's cancelled.
Where do I know what was written in the local press, I came one night before visiting the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, said they didn't care, it's not their job.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said all I can do is give us one fine instead of two (my and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my visit day stand at the gendarmerie and give the statements there!" Ovidiu tells.
In conclusion, the family was amended due to erroneous information on the fold and controllers who "implemented the law to blood".
It's not fair, and I did a sit-down at RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not too much, but the point is, I felt wrong.
Ghinion for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in pre-emptive detention
The trial of the seven rapists from Vasului moved to the Court of Appeal of Iași yesterday.
The judges judged the first term of judgment in a non-public meeting where the seven young people accused of mocking an 18-year-old asked to be released.
Prior to the actual commencement of the trial session, one of the judges of the Chamber who had been assigned to his file, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for restraint, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
The judge activated until summer this year at the Vasului Court, where he was the president of the Pelle Section, who, on 9 April, admitted a challenge made by four of the defendants, providing for their detention at home.
Today, the file is judged by a complete file of Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu judges.
Previously, in the file, Judge Dan An ton made a ruling on the reason his daughter is in a marriage relationship with one of the lawyers of the rapists.
The two judges decided that the rapists from Vasului should continue to remain in preventive detention.
Your nerves will remain incarcerated for at least 30 days, when judges will re-release the possibility of their release.
The next trial period will be held at the Court of Appeal Iași on 6 October.
Before arriving at the Court of Appeal Iași, the van with which the rapists from Vaslui were transported was involved in an accident in the district of Păcurari, the car entering Iași on the belt.
The Iveco motorway with which the seven rapists were transported hit a Volks Wagen car that had left the street of Canta, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van runs from the end of the stables.
The car entered Iasi around here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi to the Grazduri, then on the belt road.
They thus shorted the road a few kilometers away.
Immediately after impact, the escort of the arresters called for another transport to take over the detainees.
In a short time, a car was sent to the accident site from the Maximum Security Prisoner Iasi, who took the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
Following the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the cars, and the arresters went out in a speed, two and two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police because the drivers of the two motor vehicles have amicably understood the damage to be paid," said Chief Commissioner Medalin Tăranu, IPJ.
Major migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what it will follow.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clear and thoughtful: the no 7,000 refugees that should and must naturalise Romania is in itself a insignificant number, but huge in comparison to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, to some 1500 souls, far exceeds our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants really agree to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extremely small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parazed by interlopes and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate the gypsies is just a trivial example.
Moreover, governments of every color have not been able to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, ensure decent health care, gather the mess on the street, create honorable jobs or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they flee?
But what makes a lot of wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are first struck by the belligerent birth of the strong states of the EU, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing trouble with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - of another language, of another religion, of another blood.
He's probably afraid he won't steal any of his national beings.
In the end, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for departure, accept no destination of the exodus other than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Well, not all refugees are Syrians, and there's no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be taken down.
The causes have to be eliminated, some support and, by placing strictly on the book of political correctness, demand peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an ankylosing construction, broken down and overcome by the situation.
I deplored the fact that Romania was unable to invent a country project, but that neither the EU had a future plan.
And improvisations and threats don't help anything.
What, then, is the use of the EU, if the only advantage enjoyed by Romanians - the right to free movement - could be discussed because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will be over.
Not the migrant crisis, though.
Over the next decades, overcrowding, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially from Africa into a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what it will follow.

Two brothers from Tomești swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital.
Two 9-year-olds, 11 years old from Tomești, brothers, have swallowed more Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was treated, and the drugs weren't hidden.
The children were taken by emergency to the "Holy Mary" hospital in Iași.
They're stable, as doctors say.
A meeting that breaks your heart.
At 20 years of age he received a brave gift: the biological parents
Lost in the hospital in unclear conditions, in the darkness of the '90s, when she had only two months of life, little, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years when adoption was vaguely regulated, a young girl, now a beautiful blonde girl, met in Iasi with biological parents from a county village, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will be 20 years old, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought of giving their beloved daughter a wonderful and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Iași, to get to know her unclear past.
"The Day of Iasi", who assisted in the search for the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings that practically broke your heart.
Reporting the reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crina begins 20 years ago in the village of Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
There began a misunderstanding between parents at home, and my mother had to leave the house.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
She stopped the girl, and since then I've known nothing.
"When I found out he was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the Pashcani municipal hospital, and still the daughter's father, Costique Balkans, went to work in Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives were to be separated permanently.
They never found Crina at the hospital.
After hospitalization, Crina's father left for work in another town, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he came back, never found her again.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"I thought she was abandoned," says a grandchild of the family.
Because of financial problems, Grandma couldn't come with Crina to Iași, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one has been interested in the fate of the child all the time, she was taken over by the Directorate-General for Social Assistance and Child Protection Iași, who then gave it to care for the Placement Centre in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more light regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center was found by the Italian Salvadoran and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but did not succeed.
They fell in love instead of the Crina blonde, and after some time this had to move permanently with them to Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, as long as the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
"As if my wife had given him life," he tells us smiling Savior, the adoptive father, while he catches up with the daughter's fir hand.
In the country, Crina's parents, Alina and Costica, continued their search separately, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities of Ruginoasa, but he didn't get any answers where his child might be.
The police then sent her that she might be dead, but the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me to the court that she was going to Italy to Palermo.
And the conditions to look for her I've never had.
We prayed to God to be well.
I've been thinking about her all the years that have passed, but there were no possibilities to walk, to find her.
"It's hard," she tells us tears in the eyes of the biological mother of Crina.
But even though the years have passed, the parents of Ruginoasa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and her wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past links her to Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I think I was five or six.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," Crina says.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March of this year, the Chief Romance Commissioner Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Counseling Iași, was contacted by a knowledge of Italy, which explained Salvadore's desire to find the biological family of Crina.
And the search only started from a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started our first steps.
I just got a name, Cosic Balkans, then the town, Ruginous.
Soon I had an activity with the city hall there, and I was able to ask if there was by the locality the name received.
Then they gave me some clues, only that the person found wasn't the one wanted.
"It lasted about a month until we found the girl's biological father," the Chief Romanist Ichim explains.
In total, over three months they took the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially that each had a domicile in another town.
We started going somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided that a first meeting would take place in September," Ichim added.
On the weekend that passed, Alina and Costica first saw their girl lost in the hospital halls in Iasi 20 years ago.
The father, moved, could hardly control his tears, and his hands trembled unceasingly.
He's barely changing a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't even sleep.
He was all excited, shivering.
"To see your child after all these years, it's something," a niece tells us, come and she with Costica from Ruginoasa.
The encounter with the biological mother and brother of Crina
In his discussions with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-quoted university in Italy, Cosica Balkan told him, among other things, that if he ever wants to return to him, in the village, he can come quietly: he can give him something, goats, to find a boy in the village and hook up a household.
Mom's also excited, crying, and she hardly thinks that something like that could happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think something like this could happen.
I've seen such cases on television, I've been thinking about these years, I've hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a connection," he tells us with big tears on the cheeks Alina, Crina's mother, while holding a napkin tight in his hand.
In it she hides her tears, happily, because soon she will see herself with her face after so much bitter of time.
On the other side, Crina, who will only be in a few days, this month, 20 years, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she sketched a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are finally the ones who raised me.
It'll be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a nice memory of them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses.
First family reunion in Iași
In the Union Market, under the autumn sky, the family in Ruginoasa again unites their destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old, finishing high school, after the Italian school model, but may begin a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
It doesn't separate its borders or countries, it's just a barrier: language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in central Iash, they passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say it is the first event of this kind done, and that, in the future, if the opportunity comes up, they will do it again.
It's the first event of this kind organized, of such emotional loading, and I'm glad to be successful.
We, in the Centre, have different activities, and we are often associated as an institution that deals only with people who are consumers, people who are drug addicts.
But we're trying to get society back something good.
"If I will be asked for such an event again, I will do it with great love," says the director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Counseling Iași smiling.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, goes away telling.
I understand: they have a lot to tell each other.
Armistice with guns to the foot yesterday at PSD.
Everybody's shooting their soul.
The camps in the outlying PSD branch have concluded an armistice with a weapon on their feet.
After successive rounds of talks, conducted from Friday to Sunday, the first and the most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party's executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the outgoing social-democracy will send him a full list of potential candidates to the party's functions.
Far from being over, the party's internal war seems to have only taken a break to allow the fighters to shoot their soul.
Dragnea didn't give a ultimatum.
He has launched a very simple and very current message under the conditions of now: try to find a solution not to endanger the party.
On October 3rd we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of discussion on the weekend have only led to the conclusion that nothing is certain has been established.
In the October elections, an acute competition is expected for the office of president of the PSD’s judicial branch.
The short list of possible candidates for the main function of the party's office is the Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, County Councillor Vasile Quantea and Interim President of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
To these may also be added the mayor of the Municipality of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant taken into account is also the candidacy of the leader of the PSD’s court councillors, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu is no longer in the race, sources from the party claiming that he is not interested in the function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former head of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
Under the statute, even on election day, candidates may be filed, and no one would be surprised if it happened.
"It's important that we stay together, and we'll stay together after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent Judicial Office and all new management structures," said Quanta.
Until the internal elections are held, the head of the PSD’s judicial branch will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on vacation until September 29, preparing the elections to be provided by the branch's executive secretary, Judge Mihail Popescu, in cold relations with Nichita Camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu has appreciated the discussions of the last few days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
It has reached a partial consensus, in support of a unit team to deal with the county.
"But, on the other hand, there are several variants of the intentions related to the candidacy of PSD Iași, the list remaining open," Stanciu said.
An exit judge refused the rapist file in Vasului on the grounds of conjugation.
The seven young men in Vasului County convicted of rape arrive today at the Court of Appeal Iași.
The Vasluians sentenced to punishment between five and eight months and eight years and four months today will present their arguments regarding their release, after the court of law, the Vasului Court, has established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence has been handed down.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, Judge Dan Anton making a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked that one of the defendants' lawyers, Bogdan Luca's lawyer, is the concubine of his daughter, Dana Anton's lawyer.
Luke defends Silviu Ovidu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this case.
How Judges Motivated Sentence
At the end of last week, the judge of the Vasi Court who condemned the seven young people motivated the sentence.
In motivation the judge talks about the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, specifying that such attitudes create a strong sense of outrage among the public.
"The Court finds that, after the time of placing under the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not deprivation of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and local supporters, a strong sense of outrage was felt at the level of the local and national community regarding the fact that persons accused of serious acts are judged to a lesser extent," the motivation of Vasului Court shows.
The magistrates also demonstrated the main defense of the seven indictees who during the trial invoked that the girl they raped would not be the "house of the church".
"The court stresses that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, which the defendants wanted to highlight by the defenses they have formulated, since a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext," it is further stated in motivation.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed in the last decades cannot continue the same in the following years.
Until Saturday, few people knew who Jeremy Corbyn is in Romania.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many wonder how much can affect the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of post-war workers.
Marxist declared, anti-monarchist (he asked Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingham Palace), a fierce anti-American and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the Russian Today TV channel), and of the terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to renounce nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who considered the killing of Osama bin Laden at that time to be a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferred to the United States.
Following the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like what he said and promised and Tsipras in Greece until he gave birth to the real world and economic laws.
The new Labour Leader's economic programme includes, inter alia, massive renationalisation and money printing as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the solution to printing money is not unanimous adopted on the world, then we would have global prosperity! but who should stop such details.
Sure, we can charge bankers to blood, become some kind of left-wing foes, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterand and Hollande's mandates.
The additional amounts are quickly swallowed by generous promises, without cover, made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher pointed out, "the problem of socialism is that at some point the money of others ends."
Few give Jeremy Corbyn real chances to ever become prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical left leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extremely convinced as the party's new leader, failed sadly in the elections.
And then there is still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more sensitive than they are now.
Under the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant throughout the workforce, and extensive automations have made it necessary massively qualified labour force, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its last issue of the Financial Times, Corbyn's election is seen as increasing the chances of Brexit and the coming out of the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis that shakes from the EU's foundations, you get to an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide after the referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the Union the loss of symbolic capital for the whole European project and the deep gaps created within its Euro crisis and now that refugees, between the North and the South, between the East and the West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
More and more for a whole series of Member States, London was a contradiction to the Franco-German axis (where Berlin is becoming more and more the dominant player anyway).
It is true, the British business environment, the City, are strong lawyers of the country's remaining in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer the one in the past.
There are many resentments, which are growing in intensity even these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we had a recent show in Jean Clude Junker's speech, is increasingly tending to make major decisions over the head of the large majority of Member States by consulting only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this is happening under conditions where electoral support for anti-system formations, anti-immigration that are at the same time and Eurosceptic increases spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative loads has reached higher rates than ever before.
What about the conclusion that Financial Times draws when assessing Brexit's chances?
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from the national interest.
If the electors make the brain decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in today's politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we are witnessing a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and the periphery of the interest and decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States is fueling their populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed in the last decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both of which have been provoked by early decisions that have only taken account of integrationist political ambitions, the capacity and willingness of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may affect the situation of Romania more heavily.
And it's hard to rule out something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brancuşi, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brunches: "Take the workshop and muff it!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him all over the world.
Behind his fame, however, is something almost forgotten today, when millions of successful stories are delivered, prescriptions for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "trude."
What do you write about Constantin Brâncuşi?
What else is there to say, actually?
His figure appeared on the bills.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising flash.
Brunches produce and deliver money to almost 60 years since he's gone among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards bearing his name.
Moreover, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with the odrasla, he hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park, to the Brancuși".
The country is haunted by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to so many people, from children, to the elderly.
Brâncuși's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Neither did the Communists succeed in removing it from Romania's memory and culture.
Its quotes are spreading the internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and sharers.
And then, again, what else would it be to say, to write about this man?
Looking at the pile of books and articles trying to reconstruct his destiny, Brâncuși's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you weren't lucky enough to be born in a big city and in a family how fast your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brâncuși's life is the perfect counterpart.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe this is where the next text should start.
With a sentence, however despicable they are.
Look at the foolish success stories, which are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on television.
Look closely at this man's figure.
You want to know how he made it in life, how, today, did he hear a whole map world?
It's simple.
He's worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on 19 February 1876, in Hobița, a small village in the municipality of Pescișani, Gorj county, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Mary and Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although it came from a wealthy peasant family, Brâncuși leads a modest life, but one of which would pick up the signs that will guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre Tiutăa, from Paris, in 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people were leading, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything went quietly from one season to another.
And you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
However, Brâncusi's childhood was far from an idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the year spent in the hometown.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncuși. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantine Brâncusi was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, when the target was being "at the casino", following those who taste the liquid to see if the process is going to work properly, Brâncuși captures a moment of general attention.
She fills her palms' head with sugar and drinks unsalted.
It falls into sleep almost instantly.
The first people noticed only a few minutes later.
My mother panics, then hysteria, believing her son died.
In the evening, when Father Radu returns from life accompanied by wrestlers, he sees from far away the desperate signs of those waiting for him with his soul in his mouth.
The party immediately turns into a larynx.
The father is already thinking of burial.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brandsha, Doftoroea and maids of the Branches.
The cheese checks the baby's breath, then puts it under his horse's bale nose, gathered around.
The baby sneezes strong.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep further, his drinking, his joy, the party with fights continues with even more force.
The next day, father and son meet through the livade.
Radu Brâncuși makes Constantine collect some nuts and bring them to him.
The father puts his child down and, with the nuisances brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And while he feels the sting of the blows, the little Brancuşi has the revelation that the world can be looked at from another perspective and that the things around can appear overturned.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would acknowledge in his old age, unless the star himself participates in his disorder.
Had the sun also been as troubled as his father of what had happened to him?.
At the current time, the city does not work
A parliamentary appeal to politicians to remind them of those who voted for them.
Independent MP Viorel Blejuț appealed to PSD and PNL to stop internal struggles and redirect their agenda to the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great disparity and so much.
I didn't see anything of the 2012 USL projects to continue.
Neither highway, nor Regional Emergency Hospital, see only how politicians dispute their possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let's just leave politics a little bit, get together and talk.
At the current time, the city doesn't work.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you," said Blejuț.
He appreciated that the current political class disappointed the Czech electorate, the consequence of which was to be a very small presence in future local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
The Member also believes that voters will also turn to traditional parties, expressing their reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "For Iași" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only tear away from the right electorate, not from the PSD.
Such parties are based on active civic people, who are usually on the right.
"It closes even more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," said the Blush.
He stated that he is not interested in a candidacy for future local elections, disclaiming the rumors of his intention to register in the City Hall race.
I also said I don't want to run for any local functions.
I'm still thinking about whether to continue as a Member and in the future term.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Iași and in the discussions in the halls, with the other MPs, and I was accused of wanting to picture me.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything," said Blejut, who appreciated that the main reason why voters are no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the electors.
A colleague from Tâtărasi said he couldn't get his money and he had to take the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
There's little money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to raise the money from the cash register.
At the end of the term of office, I will make a report on everything I have spent, outside the salaries of cabinet employees and maintaining them.
It happened to rise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transport, accommodation and the others.
"To tell a parliamentary that his money isn't enough, it's pure hypocrisy," concluded Blush.
