The remaining UKIPs that refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to do health tourism, and when, with this in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him whether people living with HIV are included in unwanted ones.
First you use specific arguments, then you discredit them by a slightly veiled homophobia.
Whenever I and my family need NHS, we have to line up behind those chronic hypochondria intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think it's you who use specific arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing snails, does not exist practically.
I believe that is what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A citation drawn from a torch does not constitute evidence.
Yeah, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail didn't write the report, he just commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in that country should be shot for propagating such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
You also know nothing about my personal situation or identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate on homophobia charges.
Farage's sentence was very surprising, but only because we talk so rarely about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You'll have to get back to it.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I imagine you don't like it when the media talk about what you don't like.
It is so rarely spoken of because unlike Farage and his bold followers of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection of their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
Finally, the situation is as bad in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis that comes during the austerity period, nothing will be fixed.
Experienced almost 5% of growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland the ''TIGRE OF EUROPE'' was boasting us, a few years ago.
We've met the next one!
This begins again with reading the article.
One tries to make Ireland believe that it is a virtuous country and that a '' NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE'' is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest societies in Europe, a very flexible work market, a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients not what ''to povoise''' for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 1980s of the twentieth century, the irlancation was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with the Portuguese In considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development was not a long, quiet river, it is in view of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's wrong!
Latvia has a 0% tax rate on businesses.
Now there is a hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on the taxes actually paid by the multinationals.
According to the 2008 or 2009 report, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars all over the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily caps since the return.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon burn.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hanging on the A140.
Is Ryanair now planning to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon be buying a whole new fleet of aircraft, so some bosses and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once gratified.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair have to pay a surcharge to passengers for the additional fear that it was appropriate to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give each other joy.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and believe that those who pay anything other than the basic tariff have to take themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error of the airport air controllers.
Passengers were placed on another plane in less than an hour, they were not entitled to compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good travel
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally grunts the world.
People do not come in mass for the quality of restaurants (some, for the most part) or for the magazine fair in the White Manteaux Space (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly alive and lively.
With many foreigners who spend .....
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are opened on Sunday, drunk world with 50% tourists .
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that would seem admissible to me is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is clouded by the fact that they buy in detachment.
Tourism areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons .
The industry remains where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows to lower prices .
Sunday rest is a right which, except for exceptions, benefits employees.
That is why it is planned and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for the Economy, nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has the slightest power to reform the Labour Code.
While they're hanging it.
What's the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and businesses who want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my town of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal Bible is open 4 days a week but not we!
This is access to culture ...
And this is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's succession was, against his will, to use to pay the cost of succession?
There are paintings.
Some are good, other terrible steps.
Surely his succession would want his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Neither do I.
But for 5 years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 He stood before the other aristos of the government who wanted to discuss an "agreement" with the Nazis and he very skillfully won.
Thanks to his beautiful rhetoric and energy, he united the country with the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world can thank God for having had during these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no one else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to gather the money from the cost of succession, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, they gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was "the moment of truth", Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A return from the internal market through public works will only encourage large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, with infrastructure sites by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they clearly reflect the real mal francai: their mistrust towards dialogue
Back to the prince values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Either we come to his aid, that is, he has DROIT in exchange for services that he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the dancer who lives income from his property.
There is a need to differentiate between the person who invests for a return at the time of retirement and the person who lives on his pensions.
A good to rent or even two for a couple above, it's vice
Finance's little genius lacks imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of lack in large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal therefore in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline arises in response to a recession which is only a savage decline therefore brutal
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investments is overwhelming: isolation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc....
Taxation that promotes high incomes and rents.
Who's in power?
He's obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a cockroach.
Samsung's profits are damaged by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
The mid-September AppleTM introduction of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple's sake.
I believe it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft put in place this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I like design.
Some people do not attach any value to design, for them the options, functionality and price.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for a better platform.
Is there a "better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It's healthier and needs to be encouraged.
That's what we all want.
I am glad that you have found exactly what you are looking for and that it is not an Apple product, even if I have made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, of course about Parisian fools) could tell us what authors they fight ideas about gender and tell us what works they want to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Actual Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I love you, and you're a smart, cultivated person.
I said this about Judith in the vein of Furusato referring to Holopherne, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I do not have his lively mind).
Otherwise, in the "bottom", since you're sending it back, I don't care, and I honestly don't see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my back, because I'm slow but I understand...
@ Jean: Recognize that, culturally, send Judith back to Holopherne, so do it.
Who's afraid of the world?
But what are we afraid of those who fear?
Furasato and @ give us feedback.
The first invoking Judith from the Bible, the second in calling Judith Butler a very symbolic slicer of the throat.
We see how much these studies affect the most intimate of their homes.
We are obviously no longer in the discussion of the idea.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read,Jean, that the World published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
Trying to fight ideas from the only exhibition their detractors make ( Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologist) doesn't seem very rigorous to me.
But, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it's the whole difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic slicer of the throat, I was content with the "Second Sex" (it was more than my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I looked at the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed itself when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and made up for some disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really close the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special blood moon flash.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey make Labor responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will give it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne, so naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover the whole week of the rain of Persian meteors and for almost all of the important astronomical phenomena in recent years.
I'm beginning to think that there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything in the sky.
Melbourne is not really the best place for an observatory, even if things get much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes where I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburb of Melbourne.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this eclipse.
WHO looks at this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will you obsess when it ends (forcely) by disappearing?
You seem to spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages where people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed with EUX.
Superb picture of the moon above the Harbour Bridge of Sydney.
Looks like Mars is going to crash with Earth!
Nothing on stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequalities between labour and capital incomes.
Nothing about tax fraud.
The ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these calls are not given.
No hyperlink to the original documents so that we can get an opinion.
Let's see today Tuesday, October 15th, the results of miraculous revenues: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest for five years.
In Greece the stock exchange collapses.
Yet they seem to be the examples to be followed.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation of EUR 8 billion.
The Department of Economics states that these claims for compensation are not based.
What if the Ministry of Economic Affairs is wrong?
Will decision-makers who have gained political gain from the courageous attack of notaries have the same courage when submitting the invoice to the state budget?
The suite in its time.
Okay, thanks, JYL.
@lol No the State is not comparable to households in terms of managing its budget because the temporal horizon of the State is theoretically infinite, while the household's horizon is tainted by the lifetime of its members.
In addition, unless public spending is considered unproductive, it contributes to the financing of tangible and intangible investments from tomorrow's growth and hence future revenues.
Some elements of response.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrate: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately the truth does not correspond to your ghost.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands bound by the law as written by policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooter rooms for drug addicts rather than having them in the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the uncultivated masses.
In fact, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with drugs because Liberals want our health system to look like that of the United States, you should learn how it works.
Doctors around the world are courted in the same way, but it's more or less visible.
It may have been poorly formulated to put the fault on the tubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to business benefits and "research".
So read the few reports on our spending on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare the world prices of drugs present everywhere, as well as the differences from one country to another over what is on free sale or only on prescription.
This is reinforced by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalation against oncological pain, despite the laws that brake them and the expensive permit.
Although manufacturers of some drugs may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are used, those who come to a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you ma'am but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the flea in the ear of a hospital manager.
We can't keep patents on grass...
If "researchers" in social sciences were doing research instead of doing politics and networking, their "work" could be used.
One investigator investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Compare it's not looking.
To compare is to make pedagogy no research.
We can't say "search is done you have to apply it" and then in the same jet "you have to experiment with everything."
If your research is done, why experiment?
If your research is not completed, why do you ask us to apply it?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other materials?
New technologies allow students to learn on the condition that they learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they could not learn?
The Pisa tests are only an indicator, let's make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the point of building an indicator that informs you of what you're up to, a will to self-promotion, a deception?
One way to train teachers is to get away from training sophists and ideologues and practitioners to teach practitioners.
read the paragraph on the internships (which is not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that primarily leads to the reproduction of current practices, and does not allow the system to advance."
In view of the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be hoped that only practitioners will teach practitioners, even if they have all their place in modern teacher training
Theoretics of education must have no place.
The practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Giving more weight to the theorists of education would destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally fierious: if I don't want to be operated by a practitioner who only has theoretical training, I would like to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and has learned about the task.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP in charge of the fight against copyright violations by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaers thank you.
If one day I start to feel guilty of violating copyright, it will be enough for me to read an article like this.
In an information economy, infringement of copyright = theft.
It's the same thing because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without having the right license, you deprive artists of their breadwinner.
You can always argue about bad assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become as true.
It's a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty of violating copyright
It clearly doesn't bother you to deprive artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, an almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their preferred social networks, they leave any intellectual property to the site under the general conditions they have clicked.
Perhaps if they share the listeners of their mp3 walker with a friend on the school bus, they should be expelled for violating the law in such a way.
Oh, if we could export this resource that we're laughing at, the laugh that says it's all wrong....
If it is a PS Member who says so, then we must believe it.
I have two children and when they're about to choose, I'd advise them to leave France if nothing has changed from here.
France pulls people down by continuously assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What pulls France down are the speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in private business forever.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm employed because I know I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the invalid bosses I often meet.
I fully share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
@gus, when compared to German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium and small enterprises - What do French employers expect to do so?
That the state holds their hands?
That state they accuse of the empire?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couplet on your part!
Remember me, what have you created as a job, as value added, to be so severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who abound and undermine while waiting for the permanent assistance of the state!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employers' charges, taxes, work 45h/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to claim the reduction of wages or otherwise suppress them!
I look forward to seeing all "negative" comments on this subject.
Which is ironic because of the way people always complain about the First Group.
According to what I see from where I am, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep themselves floating rather than transform.
It doesn't mean that the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do this, unfortunately.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But well, the Labour is gonna get us bored, isn't it...
It's an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the UK from creating a more moral business and taking part in calls for tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision was finally cancelled.
And there's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company has won Crossrail's operating contract for eight years.
Well the Labour, as they repeated to us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and thinks that all workers must help across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision;)
Maybe it's because the Dutch management is on good rails while the British are not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but above all new ideas.
Abellio is perhaps the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous system of franchises, not the franchiser.
"She was a beating girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "batting" is a quality superior to many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "batting" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "battants", who are not less dead, I know of it.
Leaving a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, we'll start again.
I'm not telling you it's the condition to manage, I'm telling you it helps.
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll start over.
Insinuating, it would only be a moment, that one can have merit to get out of a disease or that one can demerit from not getting out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that looses, everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, do you have any vague idea of what C?
I am afraid to think otherwise, if, having a strong morale may make it easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare for it, to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not refuse them out of fear.
Someone who's fighting medicine is primarily someone who trusts medicine..
But if we prefer to give it to the "Lord" it's something else..
Neither with merit nor courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a piece of shit, a real one, you get rid of yourself to the point of becoming a zombie.
I personally caught two, dirt, big ones, and if I "fighted" as these psychological purposes say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is just to tighten the teeth, to suffer the hell and to cash the blows.
I thought the charge against Milosevic was decided and finalised a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in newspapers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was carried out "fast" and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at the time?
Did the communist become a nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans over the past decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left behind: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the MOINDRE Rule of International Law?
What country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended him, he would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to detach part of a sovereign State that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was almost recognized by the Western States, which then ultimately lied about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office for not having understood the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Finally, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as Tyran (even if we did not love him).
As far as I know, there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece that is walking around, measuring the piezoelectric level in the quartz.
Such studies are undoubtedly useful and thank us for sharing the results.
A hope therefore, but prudence is to be put This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the Cygnus constellation which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study conducted by Drake Deming's team and Jonathan Frane of the University of Maryland.
So the method to follow.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat to arrive.
Thank you science passer for giving us, often, these experimental prowesses that are made in the world.
How would animals know (In advance)?
Probably due to the perception of other elements whose rate evolves in the event of earthquakes.
Like radon, for example.
A priori odor gas for man but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable to man, but not to the instruments of measurement available to him.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals have acted strangely a few hours with a earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on art telling about the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to acknowledge the validity of their work that focused on the sensitivity of animals to Earth's magnetic fields, and especially on their modification before a earthquake.
So of course I'm not scientific, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or are we on these research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature...
If you look at things calmly and rigorously, you publish it in a serious magazine, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by the animals, we encounter the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a earthquake the red fish would turn strangely round.
I do not understand that one can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did too much as the mayor of London.
When listening to the LBC program, one cannot help but think that this man knows nothing about it and always tries to have fun with a joke.
He never answers directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name one point.
He made so many promises to be elected as mayor and he did not keep one.
It just highlights how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, doesn't it?
Because it's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and people have been instructed to worship celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and he will be voting for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the Tories' popularity rating will break the ceiling I'm sure of it.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one
That's exactly what the Londoners were saying.
He should have brought with him his friend the blinking, smarter than him.
In many respects, I think he's trying to copy R Branson
The Americans had one as President.
The French have truly and always been uninterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have given themselves the trouble of reading a few books (there exists, including a French and excellent of B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "Silver Strait" speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be in the background since the Battle of Savo) did not want to return there.
We actually passed before the island of Savo, in the 'Iron Bottom Sound'.
Even if the mission comes to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the green side is a total smoke.
Calculate the kerozen consumes to achieve the goal completely discredits the concept..
Just go through the list of sponsors than philanthropists.
An operation of com no longer does or does.
The cow, it gives too much desire!!!
I look forward to the webseries!
Your story makes me look back, identifying me a little while on the way (I also learned how to sail with the Crocos of L'Elorn at the White Moulin in Brest!).
Chapel also for the ecological message, although some criticize the impact of the displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep making us look back, and show with pride that the Bretons are great travellers!
Pierre, Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think the red hat that has shown against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Region of Brittany and the City of Brest.
More seriously it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of any kind should not devote a sum of our taxes to financing the dreams of some even as nice adventurers as those!
Are there any players in the current Serbian training that are of Kosovare origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly in Juventus and now in Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team
It's Bisevac the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was in the middle of the field or before in the 1970s and 1980s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and has played as an attacker in the great team of Velez who, under the supervision of the legendary Suleman Rebac, has completed twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also includes measurements such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the loyal team of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened in Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was in Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was tied to Blackburn *frixson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Count arrived, then he went to the Fener and as long as I know he didn't own it.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're a neighbor.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of true Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Great Albania, which embraces all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called the Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give ends of the country to neighbouring countries.
How can one have felt "an explosion of joy" when seeing two laps collapse knowing that women, men and children are without doubt inside?
How????
What bothers me a little bit in this "witness," is that the only fact that I could, would only once, spontaneously rejoice at the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies in my eyes to a personality "frontline" that all "witnesses" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
Perhaps in the short time of "joy", we would not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
We have just thought, for a moment, that for once Muslims had managed to do really and apocalyptically badly to the great wicked Satan in his own heart.
Make qqch powerful.
That's great.
It would seem that this feeling was shared by thousands of Muslims crushed by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We had some doubts about it.
The Western "Christian/White/Gaulish" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Muslim Arab world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnificent is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this evil annoyance?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigated the Arab world l: the bigot conservatism of the powers in place and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That we understood before, we must not turn Muslims back.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that is true in many countries.
But in Britain, the autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, humid and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I suffer from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
The autumn is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to cut the blow in the fall.
Not as much to cut the breath as the green of the summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Great Britain, if you're lucky, the summer falls a weekend.
We've had a great summer this year, don't make your wrinkle that slows down the clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop immunity to germs from outside, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of energizing smells, with a fever that culminates with festivities such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and many other wonderful words.
Just keep doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the control of child increases , it is the amount charged by the State that comes mainly from deciles 8 to 10 .
However , with regard to the number of households who have seen their tax increase following this measure , it is mainly deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median incomes ) according to Graph 2 .
The elimination of half of the share of widows in particular is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is completely under assessment: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not ready to work out.
Well, we're not on straw for sure, but dreamers.
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy we won't cry...
It is clear that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let's continue this way and you'll encourage these 20% unless you work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Live the Trots and OICs recycled in the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from drinking as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses its full use.
And once the money's worth is exceeded, money only serves to make money, that is to say to make the most of it.
We're among the richest 20%.
Probably also of the 20% households that work the most (and create wealth that a part of it is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these homes to benefit from part of their efforts.
Or so much to lower your arms and live social minimums, especially if you have social housing .
The utopias of the head cutters at the red Khmer have happily lived.
I did two AirBnB in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5 star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or face the least worry.
Just go to someone, sleep there, store behind yourself and go home.
This will be my first option when I'm on my way.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need a kind of owner insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, 6 hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No that's not true.
You just really missed a chance.
Based on the link provided in the section:
At its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an e-mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, made arrangements for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he received no support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who've already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I'm planning to pay a deposit and a month's rent at once but I'm a little afraid to send £1,000 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
"Support the troops," sang the Bu$herie on every tone...
So harmless weapons.
I am sure that will please families and close to thousands of dead Kurds in halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Moreover, why would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
It is not super clear the author's style: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it always time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if they were "worked 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers are gaining more than engineers.
And don't make us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But this is not seen because National Education does not have the means to provide an office to the college/lycée to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, internet connection, or supplies.
Besides, it's so much the plan at 5 p.m. a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't complete the math CAPES, come, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to collect some poorly educated clairvoyants whose parents spit on you by treating you as a handkerchief?
I believe that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the population of Khurde can better thrive.
Where we can see that the Bush administration has absolutely gone through everything.
My first graduate job was in the sale, in London, to earn three times anything and yet it was a job for which a degree was required.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London Metro, it was paid £5,000 more a year and we weren't even asking for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this respect, don't do it to you if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something that pays well, or you like to do it.
If I'd stayed at the graduates' jobs, I'd still be paying my student loan.
I do not like business so much, so I hope to end up either in the public service or in the academic world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year arrears.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of bishonous lines such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is what we call unemployed degrees.
I have one of these degrees and I've finished production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not graduation, but, as the article above says, a good career, starting at school and throughout the university.
The starting salary was lower, but we quickly rise the stages because in the real world, what counts is the results more than knowledge.
This debate engineering studies / artistic lines have lasted for years.
Scientists can't solve all problems, it's more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in order to achieve results.
Are Letters, Philosophy and Art Bishonous Lines?
That's ridiculous.
I'm guessing you're talking about media studies or whatever the abscond line you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and art are true lines.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn't it be better for a real territorial policy to disengage Paris and boost the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see the inhabitants of the bottom of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise going back and forth every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
Intra-muros and small belts already have many more practical means of public transport (métro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and key-closed parks, as already exists in the cities of northern Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Unfortunately, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
They also benefit from their great experience in the field.
Well, we didn't find a place for one single bike hanger.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not okay at all.
When discussing with pedestrians and other users of public transport the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that emerge are: 1/ it's super dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that drive super fast and fuck the survival of the bikes 2/ we take full of pollution in the head For me the cyclable tracks are going flats, you have to reduce the traffic car (urban road type congestion load), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), keep the road code verbalized systematically (even the cattle bikes before it needs to adapt the code of the written road for the animals 100 years ago to the bicycles), generalize the buffer zones after the closed passages, not before they are domestic and scooters do not generate.
The cyclable tracks are of apartheid, but it is necessary to cohabit but to rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Anything on the bike in the grand Paris?
Not a word on the place of the bicycle in public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% of veiled movements is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
In addition to what is reported by OR, EELV assistants seem skeptical.
I'd rather be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find who really hides behind this massacre.
Index: It's not Russia.
I'm not sure I like the way the world evolves.
It looks awful.
My children are not financial assets.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint was actually filed.
In addition, they should first file complaints in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be dismissed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the criminal investigation that would result.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the air space security authority, in which case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other planes had previously been shot down, Ukraine launched air strikes against the rebels in the area, and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in the face of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with innocent people's lives so that airlines pay for the land's overflight rights?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls defending their usurper government/Ukraine ultra-nationalists in the West - and who want to demonstrate in large measure that Putin has shot down flight MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is happening in their heavens.
The precedent: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the supply of weapons by the CIA to the Contras rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There's no chance that Russia won't let this case go to the ICJ.
It is funny to think that Abbott means to Putin that Australians were murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can provide evidence to support his allegations.
So far the investigators have said nothing of that.
His name is Ricardo and being such an eco-friendly belotian, it's distressing!
His name is Polar is losing the north is joyful.
One question: is the poor today poorer than the poor yesterday?
I can't help but notice that those who criticize Piketty's book most virulently have not read it!
It's easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequalities-concentration, inequality of income from work, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the term log.
It shows that the concentration of today's capital reaches that of the early 20th before 1914, it shows that it is the 2 world wars that have lowered the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what.
I wonder how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is fair, we can debate it without reading the book, the main thing being to argue in a single sense in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did you take to read it?
Is the central thesis of his pavé summarized by the press false?
I haven't read and I won't read it.
So I rely on the summary of his central thesis, and that is what I think is pure fumistry.
The concept of a gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Is not humanity globally enriched?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the price without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age at which most people just start finding their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverses are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes for happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate the girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a bit strange.
She thanked her father for giving her much freedom but mentioned that if she was not where she is now, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Is Malala herself not part of these "colored perverses"?
You shouldn't have any "antenna time" on this site.
You are, yourself, a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her at the age of 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for her to receive higher education and to have the right to decide her own marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, to the extent that he believes that women are equal to men.
What she was saying was that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at 14 years of age, without having her say.
I'm sorry she didn't put it out loud enough for you.
It may seem contradictory, but perhaps it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Rather disappointed by this season 4 entry, and especially by Jessica Lange, who obviously has a little trouble finding her soy character from Marlene Dietrich.
I have just looked at the last two seasons that are quite different but I must admit that it is one of the best series of horror, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The performance is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the anachronistic Life on Mars of Bowie is simply reversing.
I haven't looked at this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange Bof Bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I prefer to have all of a sudden to watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is about, outside of Jessica Lange's extraordinary, it's mostly the risks of staging and staging that hit me.
In AHS, there is an avalanche of original plans that makes it easy for the asepticization of today's productions.
I'm a little bit out of sight to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next few seasons without even waiting to be able to control the quality of it.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things.
It's not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her path and the way she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series is fishing in writing, she wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end up like 24 hours a day.
But it's good for everyone to do what he wants!
That's why I say "I won't look at it any more" that everyone is forced to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal to him.
But after that, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk about less tax increases, please - let's cut rather in state spending.
No, let's increase expenses please.
Those who wanted to know about spending failed.
Initiate controversy over relatively small expenditure positions, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of orientation that voters seem to call their vows and during all this time certain ones, in each camp, pretend that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and the electors see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1 per cent of expenditure.
The "debt" is assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country.
The "debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government getting one-third of my income (before even talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it was going to use it properly.
But that is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage was not entirely honest about how to reduce taxes but well, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, wind subsidies to almost useless wind turbines and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you come up with a figure that makes quite ridiculous the Labour and Lib-Dem tax on the most luxurious residences.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35 000 a year will pay about £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with £200 000 pays about £70,000 (a little over a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car vignette, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is collected from the source before local taxes and car cartoons.
I am paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let us not pretend that money falls from the sky, or that it is not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes are going.
How can a unemployed person who is looking for work at the door-to-door prove that?
Although 20% of the unemployed would not look, that means 80% are looking and they don't find.
Being unemployed myself, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruit receives 10 or 20 CV, it increases my chances of so much.
Actually, I haven't heard from Pôle Employment in months, does that mean that agents are more busy with control operations than they really have to bring back job announcements?
I don't see the point.
Because it is not for the State to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then it is necessary to pass Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that the unemployed perform their duties well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks users of a means of transport, a head of service, or they are employees of their work, etc.
Nobody yells at the scandal in those cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times when I had business with Pôle Emploi, my rights to ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I'm not a law expert.
The fact-finding and control currently takes over, while legally Pôle Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees, they pay the costs.
Politicians and non-salaried French people grant themselves rights they have not!
It's not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance contributes to the enhancement of wage labour.
More than waiting for Arab killer tweets...
In fact, we need to have a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will arrest Isis so that this virus does not reach this area of conflict.
The situation would then be similar to the spread of the black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit of prohibiting Hadj from Mecca this year to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa application refused because of their country of origin or their recent travels.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox at Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was simple common sense but apparently those "who know" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
Nobody gets out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were contaminated after having had contacts with people in West Africa although they took "all the necessary precautions".
We can stop the advance of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let them not offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be placed immediately in quarantine.
May he pass on the message of the first and second (including religious) group and deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt he will be able to erect in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
He's still far from that design there.
It has only been 20 years since the information appeared as the premium of humanity, while religion, from the brain, has been directing our actions since Lucy perhaps.
What is the interest of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not in any way set their feet on the Church, there is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@louise: Sorry the church does not have a limited vision to France.
And in the world, it may be that it will touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you envisioned it preexisted to the Christ.
Hillel a century before he already said to him: "Don't do to others what you don't want to be done to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes well beyond a mere reciprocity but introduces the agape.
Your "progressing justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: We remove the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain this hero who has upset the moral laws by redefining the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to take on their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted from force and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much between buying this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It's not making up.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If it's the PC version that interests you, Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM at £30 and also offering a 20% discount bonus.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll watch.
Obviously not at work.
The joysticks of the computer department block all the nice sites.
Hello, is it £30 then 20% reduction, or does the £30 include £20% reduction?
Note however: the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refund is zero.
It's time to buy a new video card *shut up *
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all this: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll erase it from your library if they decide to stay against the people who buy it there while they're outside the planned area.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was France in 1940 a "poor land"?
So say, this Nobel prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Do you have to love France of 40, that of "the strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano who is already hard to read in French and who describes such a limited and self-centered universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture, they.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at its fair value, if they don't already know him!
On your side, continue to visit Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hi, the terrible ones.
Ever since I drove one to Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think that followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or do I swallow like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello, Dantra, always hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I've had a few days' rest.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the beer and cider party in Nottingham.
She was a brothel.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were only fanatics of CAMRA (not to be confused with the fanatics of the camera).
Driving on the return Sunday was really tough.
On Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather to play the nine card brag.
Thanks to a real chance as a beginner, I was able to leave with several decent things.
I hope that if I reach 95 years of age, I will be as strong as him.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came in with a slice of lard on it.
I admire M.
Read some Buddha and you'll understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to upset you, I think you're getting a little away from the subject.
This famous totality, it prohibits the quests for the Jihadists at the exit of the mosques.
She's signaling arms trafficking without delay.
We either have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker either we have big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping our eyes closed that we reach the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you are making a monumental counter-sense: all the representative authorities, organizations or associations, Muslim or non-Muslims, who have formally condemned the IE and its crimes, French, Muslim or non-Muslims, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Those who say no agree.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be foolish and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they manifest publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt them.
This principle is in my view the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the offence of French society.
If there is no doubt, as well as say .
Who doesn't say a word, but what?
Consent to a proximity with IE or IE conviction.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to eat goat and cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, during the elections, "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified to the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely concerned with Scotland as there is no seat.
They can do what they want in full electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the NPS is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP that will cut their heads off in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "Promesse" thinking that he saved his party but did not realize that he signed the death sentence of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are asking their leaders for accounts.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think this is more important than that.
Not if the Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Circulating 85% pumps to the detriment of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish MPs can no longer vote on matters concerning England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists and it worked.
However, he is still in law to be Prime Minister in 2015 and since he has won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is "The Life of Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the long run, this will have at least a sterilising effect.
I expect the next ticket: Amazon manufactures your book based on your profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!

Thanks for the article.
As under this system, management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have the reading of pirated files, public domain books or purchased from some publishers who have the intelligence to propose files without mouchard.
In view of the price I paid the Kobo, it's no regret.

In your general library, you will notice systematically that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding labour leaders whose opening and completion rates are probably ridiculous.
For example, James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake.
@Thomas: In the age of Big Data, data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same bowl.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that does not allow for the identification of readers or authors.
But Kobo's got all this information right, him.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be headed by a class of children full of schizophrenic acid.
It is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some Erdogan partisans think that Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn't want to shoot a bullet in the foot unless it earns something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it's actually shooting a bullet in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: "AP reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad's law because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sent a serious warning of reprisals or whether it simply advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what really surprises is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
Indian Punchline's reading is to strongly recommend to anyone who pays attention to details rather than to the c*nneries rocked by traditional media. The short article you link is important and should be read in keeping in mind realistic comments / previous warnings from Iran to propose Afghanistan around 1979-1980.
Who are these "moderate" who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline politics pushes the world towards the abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to "moderate" non-existent to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"Is it even worse than this if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one in my head.
There would be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Is it "must"?
Do you realize that neither the criminals, nor the victims, have the slightest chance to be alive?
A little late for that, buddy...
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like, 120 years old?
A little late for that, huh?
Particularly concerning the CUP triumvirate that planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the 1st World War by vengeance by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a haunted place in Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a shame!
An impressive mastery of the sophistication of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we are looking in vain for contact with the real.
What clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in the belly of a mother wearer.
Lesbian couples may simply be a child's desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Hetero-sterile couples too.
As for the children!
What a shame to name them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their life and to pay the retirement of this lady (?)
The GPA is probably a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.

Many women have brought and put into the world children who were not their husbands.
It's still like this, we're done like this...
The important thing about this is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics aren't they the same as body merchanting? !
Anatronik Fareinheit...
It is certainly more elegant to grow a good in distant countries via the internet and Pay Pal than to dull its responsibilities and or to avoid scandal in another century close to home without yelling at that time on all the roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done in the name of the church! ...
There are only Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
However, the exploitation of the bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.
At the end of the 1970s in the Midlands, I only saw that far away.

But if you like it and you listen to music - this music today always touches you so much.
I don't know why there are so many disparaging comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who've never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on football that awaits your comments.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there is a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of Northern England's culture.
Nothing surprising that Paul Mason had grasped the social and political context, he understood things well.
Northern soul still lives, but it has been vamped by capitalism and today it is essentially a phenomenon of surface.
Having said that, you can take an ear if you are in the London region in November: 99psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, 15 November at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I too thought "always the same story," but here's a little well-written and well-thought article.
Your criticisms really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan de Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.
Drowning pills.
Whatever the train station before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after buying a ticket to stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently Police Series, Gently Northern Soul, which took place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming increasingly poisonous.
The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misses an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (in fact, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahou and their voters have all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock, and went into the water.
An Israeli stole them from him.
The Israeli representative was angry and said, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren't even there at the time!"
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things have been clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not lower custody ...
That it displeases the anti-Israeli is a clear fact, it is not the aim sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And it's always been like this since politics is globalized...
Avoid it, avoid it...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it certainly continues!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What relationship of strength has made it possible for Israel to be created?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force report today!
Do you doubt ?!!! ...
Besides, it's not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian's journalists seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Much of what he says is only pseudo-chomskyist bilevesées written by no others.
This proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a series of personal attacks and innuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes her, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A truly vicious burden, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand tells certain truths, perhaps truths that one prefers not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrors some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but all this story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that he tells people just not to vote and instead to cross their arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos he posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting democratic commitment to it is completely useless, the two parties (to slightly different degrees) ruling primarily in favour of particular interests, multinational companies and rich, at no time he does he just say to ignore politics completely because these parties do not rule on our behalf: he insists that rather than just vote and disconnect for five years, people should become much more politically active at the local level, organize movements, demonstrations, petitions, and try to influence politics from this.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active by presenting his applications may go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are puppets who will change their mind if they really risk losing the elections), but it is furious to see all these condescending answers that say that this idiot who makes Jesus tells young people not to take the trouble to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it is really distorting his arguments.
Its solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people discussed what it really says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The thing about voting has been completely distorted.
The futility of dragging a ballot in a ballot box every 5 years makes me deeply upset that my vote really counts for nothing.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members who report locally to their electors.
In addition, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and university students from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label " pseudo-chomskyist bilvesées".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne would do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the headshoppers added to the assembly!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him into his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
He draws in a political discourse that has existed for generations, but which has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This "float" shows above all in my view that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the RDV of History where trade historians have become minorities and where the exchanges of specialists have been deprived of the benefit of condensed loan-to-thinking type Sciences Po for press records.
For my part I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take up a guilty, emissary goat.
They develop each other's very rational reasonings, but this rationality is based on these emissary cows that are the key to the voice of their thinking.
Rather, I believe that for Foucault the State was indispensable as guilty.
This comes from a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
The problem of the report is solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-liberal and / or/liberal slope (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing to go seek the help of the state for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not of state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
His thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt she does not stand.
Who says guilty, said elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals cited here.
Not a single support.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old time, that of his god of then, Stalin, the small father of the peoples.
Oula, you may have read a chauya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian Revolution for an Apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel in this way...
Gauchet reflects deeply on the contemporary individual and the collective, the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree or not with him, he's an original and respectable thinker.
See this cabal orchestrated by hard left-wing human science researchers who do not support the passing of allegiance to their mantras, is quite resilient.
The narcissism and the authoritarianism of these people are boundless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebells", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other "yellow" that I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends about it, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were nice to me when they learned I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same way!
My family lived in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them have violently anti-White words.
My father's not happy that his eldest daughter came out with a White.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are becoming more and more rich, prosperity spreads outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I have been told, the Russians above all have prejudices against temporary workers without qualifications originating in the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Ienissei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard Australians' opinions about Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really strange that a stranger tells me that I don't support the Chinese, while I met two in my life (one of them abroad), I didn't keep bad memories, all people are worth it, and, in fact, those in London were very kind, that's the only reason I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don't remember who we meet, all people are brave, how they remember who they were.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here talked about Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with the said White.
How many Chinese men are with Blanches, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Whites would assault them politically.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
Yet it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: I'm sorry, but the courts are frankly marked right.
When he was in the judiciary, he represented only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be taken on the basis of the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
The observer's political vision, as well as the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
The law's obligation to refocus the assessment of fundamentals remains.
The measure of its non-compliance with all judicial acts of judges, including prosecutors, forces a distinction between the error and bias of the magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that acts of justice are not divided among these three groups.
The claim and lack of knowledge do not fall under objective analysis.
What if all of this is not analyzed, then how can it be said that justice is improving in France?
If only by implicitly revealing statistics does it start from very low.
The previous preamble allows the following to be correctly entered in the third ratio.
The corruption* of the judiciary.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such a heresy.
The area considered is that of the depoliation* of heirs committed up to fraud in the proceedings* by successive genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession obtains EUR 150 million a year and benefits from the coverage* provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where the above-mentioned statistical improvement*, moderated by the previous commentary, is that the judicial institution has produced, during many disputes between genealogicalists and heirs who are reluctant to become so spoliated, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all laws favourable to heirs.
Is the presentation of European statistics ignoring these types of rational criteria not then an elaborate form of lies?
Probably totally prohibitive prices.
More equipment to attack the disabled.
You can say that, but my brother has one of these all-ground tricycles, built to measure his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the open air as never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and tires stuck, couldn't.
As we say, tastes and colors...
Tankchairi looks like Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
Tankchair looks epic.
I don't think Whill's inventor has ever had to clean a dog chop on a kennel.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all over the place, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a hanger for the longboard.
There are hills here that they would like.
The prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put that kind of price into a bike, so "you see."
The whole tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor, however.
Many of them have reasonable insurance at their disposal.
Only if they become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things that they know properly that we need.
We can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it's just a draft, it's not supposed to be made.
I'm aware that the "long distance" wheelchair doesn't get on the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their whole lives under Israeli blockades!
A single situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation as well, since this blockade imposes a “collective punishment” on all civilians in Gaza.
" Entrepreneurs who work on their projects divert a little bit of their cement into the black market " ...
Ah that's not the wooden tongue, rather concrete and armed the lady...
The references are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The good cement goes to the tunnels!
There's the black market, it's certain, and it's recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade in Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The USA has a well-kept field: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded it!
Don't forget that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm an Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Block is Israel-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live in an underground fortress, built against the population that has chosen its masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought it through.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
It is the very definition of the economy of sharing, not for profit.
Many are only looking for a one-night shot on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping for it) in another way.
It's always much less expensive than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and treat directly in cash, thus bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this.
"What does she put in for rent on"?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
We do not use the verb "to let" in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% in accordance with all the safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to do business there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that ships can be moved, stolen and repainted, flown, etc.?
The penises are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would always be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our penises...
Where are you going to tie him up?
No Marine Le Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth among the wealthiest hands is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to end!
High finance, speculative, plays with our companies our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our food, with our health care structures, with our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they own..
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obeses of the money.
Until proof of the contrary, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy, it's finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed Minister of the Economy an old-fashioned Rothschild Bank, a history of better defending the interests of bankers, only responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else who competed?
What do you mean, turn his jacket, lower his pants?
Primary and populist response
Actually, we don't know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure that Spee really "refused" to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed sure of the enemy's exact strength.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British quiver in the area.
The sea was murky at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the battle ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this to the next battle, that of the Malouines, where, on the pictures showing survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea and in the middle of the day.
Moreover, the rescuers knew that there were no German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really correspond to what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion reigned between the German ships as to the fate of the two coursed cruisers, who had disappeared in the black after they had stopped shooting, and a race-by-step began.
The Leipzig saw something in the fire, but as he got closer he saw that it was just a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joins the battle late and lives the Monmouth, sunk and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his headlamps at the ship's flag, the proposal to go was refused and he opened the fire, finally sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee found that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 2215 hours.
Concerned about reports indicating a British seam in the vicinity, he headed north."
So, if that's true, the Germans, in darkness before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had flown, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important cuirase of the Royal Navy in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they deguerried to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should break a path through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and had cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
A number of votes are raised by the MPU to request that it be included in the law that a finally convicted election be therefore definitely ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect the left-wing elect quite naturally.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSED A SCRIPTION TO THE COUNCIL OF MASTERS
When is the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always ready to love those themselves who will take advantage of their unmovability to hinder the actions of true policies, who are really trying to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobility is to the extent that they are sufficient.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little signs "subs for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members exercise the enormous power they hold in the service of their party.
It would not defend the same thesis if right-wing, or even extreme-right trade unions, designated as the target of the members of its board and led them against a legal-media war.
Your claims are totally free.
If, at the moment, the right ignores the judicial news, it is simply that it has done the facts that matter!
There is no example of a left-wing personality that has had so much to do with Justice, but all those who have been given his attention have not been treated favorably.
On the other hand, it should be recalled that the left-wing judiciary union is not the only judiciary union and is a minority.
May a minister support trade unions with such commitment show how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you cite is perhaps minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at Chancellery, it is not a secret.
The question now arises whether the "mission" of certain judges is not more out of order than to instruct.
@gus - You should be satisfied, MS is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that the magistrates are not civil servants like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to accuse and imprison each other.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Wassel.
I think even the weakest of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepted their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Direction fills the stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of disks or left for West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is in fact one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all took part in the Eurovision competition, as did many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and the rest participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the British television light entertainment stars.
Of course, some fell into oblivion.
But this is what happens to most stars who do not participate in the competitions anyway.
Rare are those who, after a tube, succeed in making others.
However, most singers/groups can best expect three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, whatever his name is, has only fans in the United Kingdom.
His celebrity comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock path, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar nerds that smoke from the grass in their father's garage and balance three agreements on a poem level primary school will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before even release an album.
And even worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that turns fast enough to racism, because the sacralist ethnologists present these distant peoples as infinitely superstitious and petris of ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, from practical considerations to everyday life.
Unless you interpret unwisely in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as recalled to view the sacred as a sort of well-defined object and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
This article is very interesting in any case.
It's from the ephemeral deco to furnish the vacuum.
That's all.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of the Republic's illustrious figures is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw at the ears of interpretations not at all scientists who lead the life of a Mandarin, rarely less.
When's a comparative discipline critic so we can laugh a little bit?
Because what is good for archaeology also applies to the interpretations that other disciplines give.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is totally unjustified!
It is through them that treasures are constantly discovered, valuable testimonies to reconstitute history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method was not very old and before archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Today we have such powerful technical and scientific means that the interpretation of the searches is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
We are here in the middle (and old) polemic on shamanism advanced by the prehistoricist Jean Clottes (cf. his book "The shamans of prehistory", especially the increased re-edit of scientific controversy, published in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could get in there.
So it's over with us?
I don't really understand why can't we continue to three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the canary?
No, but we're not against a play on it.
We couldn't watch a musical comedy up there instead, it would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost finished, may I suggest you go to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays true journalists, brave, to write on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. to their risks and risks.
It's more than making me laugh at these puerile ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Go on, then.
If these "puerile ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this paper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is entirely possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is this the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
However, we find the video amateur of the crash on the net...
video amateur crash on the net... ??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots, it would have been safe because at the time or another vehicle (e.g. designed to protect the pilots) was entering the circuit.
But it had to end quickly before the typhoon of which we knew it was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it right to advance the time of departure (television right, pub, money...).
But apart from that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, of course, I also share that view.
But there is also that if the very British FOM enters the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to beat the English that was then leading to...
You're leaving my dear Dayrton on this blog.
But it's okay, I've got a little time to get rid of all your shit.
No, just don't.
There have been lots of conspiracys in F1, but never one that puts commissioners at risk of death for a distant history of a pilot's chance of victory to the detriment of another.
It's not the FOM that's safe because it's the FIA.
Size shade.
In view of the amateur images, the absence of an image mainly allows the FIA to avoid embarrassing questions of the type: How is it that the Commissioner acts a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the AIF blocks the images of the accident but because one of the Commissioners clearly acts a green flag, signs that the race can resume normally and that one is more under a yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark ignorance of the F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the regime of yellow flag APPRES the place of the accident, from which the green flag acted.
It's the usual procedure.
The post of commissioners just below the accident (as the case may be, it can be 10 meters as 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal look.
Sensationalism sells pubs.
I used to think that the media were an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid, ultimately, it's just for money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of not having sex, the pub and the media are good to sell us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The information is exactly the same.
Making the buzz with information that we don't really need to worry about is just to keep on scaring people so they can continue to control them.
"When the tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear" It should be "untangled", not "touch".
Given the medical reference, “tossing” is much more said in this context than “to untangle”.
I wonder if all the people who are infatuated that Ebola could begin to spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're giving them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridicules this pseudo-journalism abject beautifully and firmly.
That made me laugh.
It's depressing to me that the media are talking about most things with this optimism upside down.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without going into hysteria) for the government to make us get rid of it when it needs it.
I believe it is perfectly logical that, if we have to undergo a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any evidence?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that he has invented himself.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be still of this world almost 35 years later.
Moreover at the beginning it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of going through it for years .....
Perfectly useless testimony.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only do the testimonies serve nothing: taken alone, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective appreciation of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
This may be why patients in psychiatry should not be asked questions when reliable observations are made from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my mother-in-law explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's crazy, it's a subjective testimony of no importance.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
What are you looking for, then?
On ghosts?
Do you have the same level of fantasy theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
“Resilience”: the word cane adulted by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after reading D’assembourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of empty buzzwords in the psys.
Cyrulnik struck us with "resilience."
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he will have given us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to get out of the air trails...
So why is that?
It was a great series and it looks like those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the all-powerful who can perform miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang up?
The only solution that comes to mind is the mood like pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
The kids were hanging up.
Oh, because it's a series for kids?
UKIP works for the Mysterones.
So keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarriionation?
It will not be the same if you do not see the sons and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing it (although being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to redefine the old.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it's been at least 40 years since we've had episodes of one hour on Saturday and Sunday at 06h.
Since the arrival free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and you can always see it at these times.
And in addition, half-hour episodes are now at 05:30, Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a 60-year-old "sad" guy, but I don't watch this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the Esplanades!!!
Radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all Israeli excavations below and around the mosque of the plans for several decades have not been able to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if it exists is elsewhere.
Can it be Argentine??
This mountain is not wanted for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the mosques were built.
Its summit, or Dome of the Rock, sails in the middle of the Omar Mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad was set up in paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to remember him regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the plan in 2 states, and he continually overcame it!).
It is also good to show the extent to which the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize His own?
The shortest Jewish joke: "God be praised!"
In order to boast tourism in Israel, we are often shown to be half-naked young naïds, oranges on the beach.
Reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary, though.
And this picture is a wonderful work of propaganda!
Too bad that Reuters' photographer did not take pictures of the hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who preferred to call the Jewish faithful on the ground, praying at the Wall of lamentations.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it's right, it's neither the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology that she conveys that we must condemn.
This system is untenable and will end in tears.
The only way to end this system is by revolution.
Since the economy seems to be drifting away, large businesses have benefited greatly from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever-increasing pay to the small elite at the summit.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in this country when workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of laughing and moaning when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not being treated with impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case, it is tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India.
This can't all end well.
It's because we're in democracy that it's been held.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TCI) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by short-circuiting national governments by secret courts.
It seems incredible, but that is exactly what the mechanism for resolving the disputes between investors and States (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is.
The Greens are against this project and try to alert people about the unimaginable damage this agreement will have on our lives.
It's only recently that we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement Watch these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
This is what makes excellent benefits, while the digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on the trees.
The next weak link will probably be the car market.
That gentleman is right, in the 18th century there were unions in all the regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let it (at last, its officers, the others, nobody knows anything) believe the safe of the eternal values of France, and it will fight and shut its mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, brief: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even though for her, it's increasingly uncomfortable...
You're still missing the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm syndicating.
You're warned, it's your fault.
For the defence of the interests of the class, there is already enough of the protected professions with trade unions, which has created a breakdown of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of a grievor's risk.
We can very well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
If not, disaster is assured.
And with the wagons that are being prepared, the government welcomes that.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
I was referring to the military and other officials because this is the subject mentioned here...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in Article 8 of the preamble to the Constitution of 1946.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and business management".
This is absolutely essential with the disruption of informational power.
And yet you've probably opened, read and commented on a specific article entitled "The Great British Bake Off Review". ??????
Wait, the section was there, empty.
I thought we had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I looked at, and I can tell you that some of them have been well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's marriage we have one of the best moments (something deceptive: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the pie mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the worst baker; no one's been like "bom, here's my fucking cake now suffocate it and bow down to your master" !
Maybe the extra pressure of friends and parents outside finally had an effect on them?
In previous weeks, all these outside persons were kept at a distance.
And there is also this idea of "playing security, there is always next week" that disappears in the last week.
I like to cook, but I don't think I'm getting into this.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us great entertainment and motivates us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to do one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to start, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only true flaw they could find was the base a little dry (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice on Richard's mill did not give way, in any case Richard had already lost at that time).
I must confess that several of the challenges in this series seem somewhat artificial because of the time allotted.
There's also cancer watching, with solar wind blows.
We're doing everything right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UV is mainly blocked by the ozone layer, which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field was weakening, there would not be enough solar wind to "hunting" the ozone of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block the UV.
They have a lot of useful functions you don't suspect.
If we are limited to man, they are interested in allowing us to have bones (synthesis of vitamin D), to warm (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks the carcinogenic UVCs and lets the UVA and most UVB pass.
Do you know that you don't have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a quit when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was subtly understood in the commentary, which he himself intends to demonstrate pedagogy.
Not to mention that I am a melanoma habit, the UV only makes it ACCELAR to its development.
They don't cause it.
For proof: not all bronzed persons have melanomas.
Or, when a tubib tells you that you need to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, you better not listen because UV is necessary to every human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like all: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UV causes melanoma directly.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
Or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have found that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use to which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resistant and therefore has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as front-line communication equipment.
But for the rest of us,
There's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have found that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied
Except for a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
That's the fourth joke about the fold I've read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before installing specific software, one imagines that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and there is little evidence of how it could return to it.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm............................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been properly installed and is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But would they put test software on everyone?
Photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of the FCC or EC logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah l article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and it's surprising that industrialists produce in » industrials' It's put out super u but all the teachings and meme the small trade are concerned How to buff good, bio avac 1650€ (average wage in French)?
But to respond to your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After each one is free to put his or her priorities where he or she hears it.
For my part, feeding is one.
Come on without a grudge, I'll kiss you
It is called Bobos, or rather Boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect from realities.
It's the total thought-reason degrouping.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example, claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in truffle, joining in this the left-caviar, which they have sometimes come from, for example by condemning CO2 releases while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and truffles, nor are you surprised to meet often criticisms about them.
Waoh, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theorization as well as for all associated details (airplane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of left-caviar?
Well, you're able to understand the concept of the boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological shade.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in the short greens.
The boboecolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the ecos, because it is the one that infests the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, nobody wants to look at this giraffe in front of them.
She's so badly hurt that she looks vaguely like a naked woman.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you simply don't have any legitimacy to comment because you haven't spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin does not know how to draw and seems always obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she has really managed to become fabulously rich and famous with no artistic ability.
That's art.
No, it's a pig.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
That's not really a proven fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke by playing pool.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real.
If you're just looking for it, a camera will do the thing.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak of itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still something to save: riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
Honesty requires that France decreases its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes in a more drastic way, to begin with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operator without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, at a time when we observe the weaknesses and shortcomings of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuarization?
@edmond: That's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save but above all not at home, at home it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look where the cage is certain.
Let all those who have sided little or enough the military thing dare to come say here, the eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting to laugh...
Applying the same potion to the public service as a whole and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really loud: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other departments and you will understand why Defense can be a little overburdened!
Well, yes, the economies that everyone agrees to say we have to do, do we have to see it somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls moan at murder when it happens at home, poor darlings.
It would be wrong to do this, but above all, that it doesn't fall on me because in this case, it's a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, come on!
What will closing the Grace Valley weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history repeats itself at each post closure, maternity, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It is odd, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and does not rejoice at the savings made in public expenditure.
This article is really the most shocking thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It is depressing to have her Facebook thread paraded and to see that 80% of her friends started their status with the phrase "This embarrassing moment."
I think they're going to make a movie.
He will probably rely on hilarious scenes where someone falls by chance on his ex on the bus when he goes to work and realizes only where his skirt has returned to his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely bullshit.
Not really, I think the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to bury his emotions and to tighten his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the scene after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
They don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has truly shown that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I'm falling back on it!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they will finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible lightning and insurpassable genius that slips from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine light.
Oh, my God, it was really nothing.
Especially if they're not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and association initiatives.
Until then we have our right to save our planet by states that play tartuffs at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take things into our hands.
With the Commissioner that they planted energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away ....
Translate: Windmills and solar farms are tomorrow's Round Points.
The whole is financed by the con-tributable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful to its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the line is not fully controlled, it is better to limit itself to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided of course we drastically reduce our consumption.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is in no way concerned.
Nuclear electricity is zero emission of CO2 to production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity by renewable wind or PVC is already more GHGs in the other stages and above all gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate intermittent.
Replacing nuclear with renewable wind or PVC would run counter to the fight against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am the State Doctor in Physical Sciences 1981 more I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the contrary to what I said.
As for what I didn't say it was you who lent me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany anything in fact you didn't answer what I said and how all the people on the right tear down the interlocutor I never do.
I also cite the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: the present renewable energy programme of Germany is an inefficient and inefficient means of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count uranium extraction and construction and if you do not count the greenhouse gas water vapour less effect than the Co2 it is true recall two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant starts in water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "South Asian giant"...!
The last time Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I'm not surprised, most Indians who post comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your mood.
It would have been the same if they had called India a giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a box of Pandore full of corruption and mafia.
As for the ISL, today's opening game was surprisingly interesting, the Athletic of Kolkata imposing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
In comparison with the billions and billions that India devotes to the IPL cricket and now to football, how could we ever compete with our "smiling neighbors"...
The low cost launch race is paid cash.
Too bad for such a nice project.
For the incident, the potential lack of design occurs only with a helium too cold.
So maybe we're not in a design defect, but implementation...
unlike arianspace that is a private company, it seems well that soyous belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
They may be paying satellites in frigates who know..
This is all the more annoying as many media loop the only articles titles - and many readers retain only those titles.
In total this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
In agreement with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly calls into question the project while it is just a launcher problem.
